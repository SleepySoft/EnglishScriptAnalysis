Hey, what are you doing?
Jesus!
Did you get a good look?
Blue Toyota Camry, it's all I saw.
It's the Wharton's dog.
  Oh, man.   He's not gonna make it.
Go see if they're at home.
It's ok.
There are two kinds of pain.
The sort of pain that makes you strong...
or useless pain...
The sort of pain that's only suffering.
I have no patience for useless things.
Moments like this require someone who will act...
or do the unpleasant thing,
or the necessary thing.
There...
No more pain.
It was a hit and run, I'm awfully sorry.
He must have jumped over the fence again.
Look, Steve's gonna file a report on the car,
he'll put his people on it.
We'll track him down.
You're stunning.
Shall we?
Three two...one...
Happy New Year!
Oh, President elected Garrett Walker.
Do I like him? No.
Do I believe in him? That's beside the point.
Any politician that gets  million votes
has tapped into something larger than himself,
larger than even me as much as I hate to admit it.
Look at that winning smile, those trusting eyes.
I clung to him early on, and made myself vital.
After  years in congress
I can smell which way the wind is going.
Jim Matthews, his right honorably Vice-President.
Former Governor of Pennsylvania.
He did his duty in delivering the Keystone State.
Bless his heart.
And now they're about to put him out to pasture.
But he looks happy, now doesn't he?
For some, it's simply the size of the chair.
Linda Vasquez, Walker's chief of staff.
I got her hired. She's a woman, check.
And a Latina, check.
But more important than that, she's as tough as two-dollar steak.
Check, check, check.
When it comes to the White House,
you not only need the keys in your back pocket.
You need the gatekeeper.
As for me, I'm just a lowly house majority whip.
I keep things moving in a Congress
choked by pettiness, and lassitude.
My job is to clear the pipes, and keep the sludge moving.
But I won't have to be a plumber much longer. I've done my time.
I backed the right man.
Give and take.
Welcome to Washington.
You need a haircut.
You think?
A little trim.
What are you gonna wear?
  You mean for the meeting?   For the announcement.
I'm wearing my navy blue, the one with the pinstripes.
Good.
You look handsome in that suit.
I don't know if they will announce it before your board meeting.
Well, as long as I can say the donation is coming.
As soon as it's official, Sancorp will write you the check.
This is going to be a big year for us.
Community of what?
I would say immigration, banking or education, but...
None of my regular sources can confirm that.
Because...
They don't know, or because they're not talking?
Because they don't know.
Keep at it, get me something.
Sorry, I'm so sorry Mr. Hammerschmidt.
Zoe...
  Barnes   Right.
Did it take him a year to remember your name?
Longer.
Good morning, Lucas.
What can I do for you, Zoe?
I am sick of the Fairfax county council.
  You tell me everyday.   Move me online.
My own blog.
First person, subjective,  words.
  Not gonna happen.   I'll go underground.
backrooms, the urinals!
I'll win over staff members on the Hill.
They need a place to vent.
  A gossip column?   No. We'll lift the veil.
What's really going on.
This is the Washington Herald, Zoe.
 It's not...TMZ.
Do you know how many people who watch TMZ?
I couldn't care less.
Which is why print journalism is dying.
Then it will die with dignity. At least with this paper.
You are stuck in the th century, Lucas,
you lack imagination.
Maybe so, but right now I don't need imagination,
I need copy.
Your nights and weekends are yours,
I applaud whatever you want to do,
as long as its not on my time.
  You're telling me to go back to work?   I am.
What you're really telling me is to fuck off.
I'm telling you both.
It's Mr. Chapman already, from Provence Trust.
Hold my calls, Christina.
Henry.
It's good to see you.
  How long are you in town for?   Just today.
What? You gotta come back down for the inauguration.
I can hook you up.
How about you hook me up with
the zoning laws you promised to get changed?
We got  millions sitting in escrow
for an empty lot we can't build on.
I know, but you gotta understand...
It's a local municipal issue.
I can't just pick up the phone...
You can't?
Because that's not what you lead us to believe
when you begged for  grand in donations.
Right, I...
Just one second.
Christina, I said no calls,
not while I'm meeting with Mr. Chapman.
The President-elect?
  Do you mind?   No, go ahead please.
Put him trough Christina.
Mr. President-elect?
Thank you.
Yes, we were pleased to win by double digits.
Absolutely, anything you need.
I need you to put your long, wet, talented tongue
between my tights
and make me squeal like Monica Lewin...
Me too.
Me too.
Okay, thank you, sir.
I'm so sorry...
where were we?
Walker...
what's he like?
The President-elect running late?
No, he couldn't make it. I'll brief him, though.
Okay.
This is the memo, I've drafted,
on our Middle East policy we've been developing.
Now, I want to borrow from Reagan.
I'd like to coin the phrase "Trickle-down diplomacy".
  That way...   Frank. I'm gonna stop you there.
We are not nominating you for the Secretary of State.
I know, he made you a promise,
but circumstances have changed.
The nature of promises, Linda,
is that they remain immune to changing cicumstances.
Garrett has thought long and hard about this.
And he's decided we need you to stay in Congress.
When was this decision made?
And why wasn't I part of a conversation?
I'm sorry, Frank, if it been up to me,
I wouldn't have waited this long to tell you.
So you knew, you were going to do this.
It has been an evolving discussion.
It's a chicken-shit move.
  Frank...   I was vetted.
  Was that a ruse?   No.
Let's be absolutely clear,
you wouldn't have won without me.
You're right, but now we have to lead.
And that means making tough choices.
As you know, education is a top priority for us.
A complete federal overhaul.
But it's not just the education, Frank,
Congress has split.
We need you there, more than we need you in the State Department.
I got you hired, Linda.
I know.
Donations, endorsements.
I wrote the campaign's entire foreign policy platform.
I bring years of Foreign Affairs Committee...
Frank.
Please.
I want to speak to Walker personally.
The decision is made.
We need you, Frank.
Will you stand beside us or not?
Of course, if that's what the President wants.
I'm very glad to hear that.
I'm curious.
If not me then who?
Michael Kern.
Michael Kern?
Well...
that is an excellent choice.
Do you think it'll look clear?
I just want to make sure it doesn't look like
we're neglecting out domestic...
No, no, no, no... I'm gonna say
  that we are expanding our mission.   Okay.
And we're bringing on a new organization to help us.
They know which one yet?
I'm still looking into a few options, but, um...
Tell me, what did we agree on that we could hire how many new people.
  Six?   Six, maybe seven.
We'll have enough.
Ooh, it's exciting. Huh?
This, uh, new direction we're heading.
I just don't know where we're gonna fit all the people.
Well, do you think we'll have to look into additional space?
No, no. I'll find a way.
Okay, so make the changes to the power point.
  And let's meet again, at :.   Okay.
It's me.
I feel like an idiot leaving messages like this. Call me back.
What is it, Zoe?
Um, I knew you're gonna have your hands full at the White House. So,...
If you need someone to do research, or...
  Or punch out background.   I think I'll be fine.
Well, if things get hectic, and you need any help...
So you can blog about rubbing shoulders with the big boys.
Wh... What did Lucas tell you?
Look, no offence, Zoey,
But I don't have time to be anyone's training wheels.
I just thought...
No, I was just actually offering to lend a hand.
  That's it.   I got it.
Thanks.
  Claire.   You didn't call.
  I was...   You didn't call me, Francis.
Nine hours, you don't not call me.
Not when it's this big.
You're right.
When have we ever avoided each other?
I wanted a solution first.
  Do you have one?   Not yet.
This affects me too, Francis.
And it's not the money I'm upset about.
It's that we do things together.
When you don't involve me we are in free fall.
I should have called you and I didn't.
What Happened?
She says they needed to keep me in Congress.
  Linda said that?   Walker wasn't even there.
That's what really get's me,
he didn't even have the courage to look me in the eye.
I knew you shouldn't trust that women.
I didn't. I don't. I don't trust any one.
Then how could you not see this coming.
I never thought they were capable.
You don't usually underestimate people, Francis.
I know.
Hubris...
  Ambition ...   You should be angry.
  I am livid.   Then where is that I don't see it.
What do you want me to do, scream and yell?
  Throw a temper?   I want more than I'm seeing.
You're better than this, Francis.
Well, I'm sorry, Claire. I am sorry.
No, that I won't accept.
  What?   Apologies.
My husband doesn't apologizes.
Even to me.
How long have you been up?
Hours.
I know what I have to do.
Good.
We'll have a lot of nights like this.
Making plans.
Very little sleep.
I expected that.
It doesn't worry me.
I'd better get to work.
I laid a suit out for you upstairs.
The navy blue one.
I love that woman.
I love her more than sharks love blood.
The President-elect Garrett Walker...
Why do you think they went with him?
We are too good, they can't afford to lose us in Congress.
He's had work done.
Chin tuck probably. Definitely dyes his hair.
  Do we say anything?   No. God no.
  Not unless he brings it up.   Nancy?
...   Cancel everything. Stanford, you're with me.
Now, look...
They've done us a great favor, Doug.
We are no longer bond by allegiances. We serve no one.
We live by one rule, and one rule only
never again will we allow ourselves to be put in such a position.
Walker and Vasquez?
All of them. I hold them all accountable.
  Retribution?   No, no!
It's more than that.
Take a step back.
Look at the bigger picture.
I can see what you're getting at.
Kern first?
That's how you devour a whale, Doug.
One bite at a time.
Who would you want?
  For Secretary of State.   Give me a list of choices.
And, however we do this, we'll also need a buffer.
You mean an errand boy?
Yes, someone we control completely.
  Okay. I'll keep my ear to the ground.   Good.
I haven't eaten since yesterday.
I almost pity him.
He didn't choose to be put on my platter.
When I carve him up and toss him to the dogs,
only then will he confront that brutal inescapable truth.
My God!
All I ever amounted to is chitterlings..
"And he that shall humble himself, shall be exalted."
Matthew, Chapter  verse .
Thanks be to God.
I'd like to speak today on the subject of
humility.
Well, a lot of you have just won re-election.
If you hadn't, you might not be sitting here.
And of course we should enjoy our success and be grateful for it.
But never let your gratitude sour into
pride.
You will have many challenges ahead over the next couple of years.
And a person's character
isn't determined by how he or she enjoys vitory
but rather how he or she endures defeat.
Nothing can help us endure dark times better than our faith.
Claire.
  Hello, Felicity.   How are you?
  Good, how are you ?   Good.
I'm sorry, it's just not right.
Charles and I can't understand what Walker was thinking.
Oh, that's very sweet.
But, really, between you and me,
I think Francis is relieved.
He just feels much more at home in Congress.
I would've bet a million dollars they were gonna pick you.
Well, it's good thing you have a million dollars to spare.
But you are by far and away the only choice.
I appreciate you saying that.
I mean, Michael? Come on, he's got half the experience...
Garrett is a smart man, he knows what he's doing.
You're a better man than I, Frank.
You...
You want some of that wine?
Yes, definitely.
Man this is some good shit, where did you get it?
I kinda lifted it...
from the VIP room of the speaker's holiday party.
I'm impressed.
Bordeaux twenty years old?
It seemed about right for you.
  Why would you say that to me?   I'm almost thirty.
Pratically ancient in your book.
I don't discriminate when it comes to age.
Really? When was the last time you hired a  years old staffer?
  Doesn't mean I wouldn't.   As long as she's good in the sack.
  Come on.   That's true, isn't it?
Where is this coming from?
You are not gonna just toss me aside for some sluts
straight out of Vassar?
So we're having that conversation.
It's been six month. It's not a little office fling any more.
You want me to say those three magic words.
One of which starts with an L.
  No.   Okay.
I'll say it.
Christina Gallagher,
lick my balls.
You're a bastard!
I love you.
I love you, Christina.
I love you.
Now will you lick my balls?
So I'm curious,
are we patrons, benefactors or lepers?
Believe it not, we're angels.
I'm gonna go outside and pretend to use my cell phone.
Go.
Could I have your jacket?
Are you coming to bed?
I'll be up in a bit.
  Don't stay up all night.   No, I'll be right there.
Thanks so much. I'll call you.
Wait... I thought you had a good time?
Oh I did, I loved it. I've never been before.
Well, maybe I could come up.
Brian, you're so sweet, really.
But if I was gonna fuck you, you'd know.
Thank you so much.
  She's here.   Send her in.
It's quite rare for a president's chief of staff to climb the Hill.
A gesture of respect no doubt,
or desperation.
I'm guessing she'll say Donald Blythe for education.
Let's see if I'm right.
Good morning, Linda.
Thank you so much for making the trip up.
Of course, my pleasure.
Education.
First things first,
the seating chart for the inauguration.
How do these two work for you and Claire?
They come with a complimentary set of tickets to the Jefferson Ball.
Claire would be over the moon.
Good, I'm so glad.
So... education.
We have Donald Blythe drafting the legislation.
Donald Blythe? Jesus.
I know.
So you want a bill just two steps left of Karl Marx.
I advised the President-elect against it,
but Donald is the face of education.
He's been pushing reforms for  years.
You want me to guide him to the middle?
We need a bill we can pass.
Do I have absolute autonomy and authority on this?
There's more.
Garrett wants the bill on the floor in the first  days.
He wants to make a pledge in his inaugural address.
Ah, that's...
That's very ambitious, Linda.
Can we make that pledge?
A hundred days?
I can deliver.
Keep me posted.
I'll talk with Donald, I'll check in with you later in the week.
Terrific.
Did you smell that?
The smugness? The false deference.
She thinks I can be bought with a pair of tickets.
What am I a whore in post-war Berlin
salivating over free stocking and chocolate?
What she's asking will cost far more than that.
  Ferguson.   Too old.
  Willis?   Too stupid.
  Boyd.   Too queer.
Really?
He's married with three kids.
And wouldn't they be devastated.
All right.
What about Catherine Durant?
Cathy Durant ...
She was vocally anti Walker.
She's got the experience.
Set up a meeting.
The donation from Sancorp...
The money will have to come from somewhere else.
God, what happened?
I've looked over the budget for fiscal 
and we've allocated   million for salaries.
We need to cut that in half.
  What, you're suggesting...   Evelyn,
we're going to let some people go.
That would be half of our staff?
We have to carve out some room.
But you'll have to fire some essential people
who have been with us since the beginning.
We are a charity,
but not for our employees.
You know, um, Claire, I have held my tongue
about this whole international thing for a while.
But, I don't get it.
I mean, we're really good at what we do,
why do we have to try and be something we're not?
Because we've plateaued, Evelyn,
and it is time for us, for our entire organisation...
But digging wells in Africa? We don't know anything about that.
Which is why we have to bring in new people.
This is the plan that I've proposed to the Board
and we are moving forward with it.
I'd like a list of names, please.
Claire, can we just think about this?
I have thought about it.
I've put a lot of thought into it.
  Yeah, but I think that we can really...   Evelyn ...
You are the office manager.
I need you to trust that I know what I'm doing.
So please, get me that list, as soon as possible.
  Oh, ma'am. You can't go...   I'm sorry, I just ...
  I just have one question...   No.
Sir, I apologize this woman...
  Congressman.   Miss you need to step away from him.
  If I could just have one second.   You step away from the...
Who are you?
My name is Zoe Barnes, I'm a reporter at the Washington Herald.
at night and this is my home.
I do not allow any...
We are part of a mutual admiration society.
You're a fan of the symphony.
One more for the people watching than the music.
It's all right, Steve. Come on in, Miss Barnes.
It's strong.
You prefer weak?
No, the stronger the better.
There's no harm in looking.
It's a cheap ploy.
It's cheap but effective.
Well, you certainly have my undivided attention.
Good. The reason I'm here...
Oh, is foreplay over?
I read somewhere that JFK never lasted more than three minutes.
The point been?
Time is precious.
Powerful people don't have the luxury of foreplay.
Okay, so why are you here, Ms. Barnes?
I need somebody I can talk to.
We're talking. Tell me what we're talking about.
I protect your identity. I print whatever you tell me.
And I'll never ask any questions.
And what makes you think
I don't already have such an arrangement
with one of your colleague.
Because if you did, you wouldn't have let me through the door.
I've led a very long, very successful career
avoiding this sort of intrigue with the press.
I can't see any advantage in starting now...
  But is there any disadvantage?   Sloppiness, for one.
I promise you absolute discretion.
So, we're talking about trust.
Use whatever words you like.
Words matter very much, Ms. Barnes.
You should care more about them, given your profession.
Then, yes...
Your trust.
So, which Zoey Barnes am I to trust?
The one who wrote about the fireman that married the meter maid?
Or the one who authored a very fine article
on a new jogging path in Rockcreek Park?
Don't be flattered, I read everything.
I'm better than what they have me doing.
You know what that feels like.
Do I?
You would've made a great Secretary of State.
How exactly may I help you, Miss Barnes?
You must know the administration legislative agenda.
  What's coming up first?   I may.
  Will you tell me?   What would be your guess?
  Education.   Why?
Immigration is too controversial,
a tax reform isn't sexy enough.
Everyone can get behind children.
  Is it education?   You might very well think that
I couldn't possibly comment.
A hint.
It's late, Miss Barnes.
Can we talk again?
I hope you'll understand that I want to sleep on all of this.
I never make such big decision so long after sunset
and so far from dawn.
My cell phone's on the back.
Did you put Miss Barnes in the visitor's ledger?
  Not yet.   Don't.
  Needless to say.   Needless.
Hello.
Claire.
This is Miss Zoe Barnes of the Washington Herald.
She was just leaving.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Underwood.
Drive safe, there's a lot of ice on the road.
I will.
Thank you.
Does that work on anybody?
Does what?
The push-up bra and V-neck T.
Well, if it does, I don't know who they are.
Ok, it's all right, it's all right.
License and registration.
The glove compartment, sweetheart.
This isn't your driver's license, it's a Starbucks' card.
Oh, shit. Sorry.
Sir, have you been drinking?
No, I never drink coffee at this hour.
I'm gonna need you to step out of the car.
Hey, I was speeding you can write me a ticket...
Sir, step out of the car.
Right now.
Look, I don't wanna be a prick, but I'm a member of the Congress.
I don't care if you are the king of China.
China doesn't have a king.
It's a communist oligarchic.
  Oil... oliguarch ...   Let's go, out.
  You too, sweetie.   Fuck, that's hard to say.
Hello?
Good.
Well, let's get him out.
Mind if I join you?
What the fuck is going on?
  I thought I was meeting with...   No.
You're meeting me.
It's four in the goddamned morning.
I've got a City Council meeting...
You've been Police Commissioner for what?
Almost a decade now?
We're here to talk about my resume?
"Mayor of DC" would look good on that resume, wouldn't it?
We know that you've been angling to run for some time.
Experience is your strong suit.
Indorsement, fund raising...
they're not.
We can help with that.
Russo.
You're free to go.
It was just a few drinks.
  It was enough to get pulled over.   I wasn't drunk drunk.
Were you alone?
Yes.
  Say it to my face.   Watch the road.
Say it to my face!
Yes.
I was alone.
You can not keep doing this, Peter.
It's going to catch up with you.
I know.
Do you think we can arrange two more
at our table for the Jefferson Ball?
  For who?   The Holburnes.
Why on earth would you want them there?
I'm gonna need her money for the CWI,
the staff cuts were just not enough.
I'll talk to Vasquez.
  How are we doing?   Good. Progress.
Irons on the fire.
I like irons,
but I love fire.
Yes.
What are you...
The bill is garbage, Donald.
Tax increases, ban on vouchers,
federal oversight.
How do you expect me to get that through a...
But Linda told me to write it, she promise...
I'm sure she said any number of things,
forget what they promised you, Donald.
They want your name because it carrys weight.
Well my name comes with my ideas.
I understand, but you got to be reasonable.
This isn't the Great Debate.
It's about passing meaningful reform,
maybe not everything you would've hope, but...
help me, help you.
That's gonna take time.
Those ideas I've been developing...
If it's time you need I will buy you time
but you've got to promise me your next-at-bat
is gonna give me something I can work with.
Okay, Frank.
I'll see what I can do.
Good. And Donald, don't let this get you down.
Why? Together we're gonna do more
than you've been able to do in  years.

Donald Blythe and Donald Blythe's new draft.
Eventually I'll have to rewrite the bill myself.
Forward! That is the battle cry.
Leave ideologies for the Armchair General,
does me no good.
Walker just nominated Kern.
It's a long road to confirmation.
Kern is a boy scout.
Nobody is a boy scout, not even boy scouts.
  What do you have?   Absolutely nothing.
Then what are we talking about?

does the job interest you?
Why would you want Michael gone?
Cathy, you and I came up together.
The Foreign Affairs Committee needs a Secretary we can work with,
someone who isn't afraid to stand up to Walker when he's wrong.
We need you.
Let's just assume I am interested.
I do not want to assume.
I want to know.
Ok ... .
Please hold.
Zoe Barnes.
Anywhere you want.
On my way. I'm gonna have to call you back.
I'm so sorry.
I couldn't get a cab, I had to take a train.
Just before you left my house,
think back
what were we discussing?
  The president's legislative agenda.   Specificly.
Education.
  Was I right?   Do the math, Miss Barnes.
  He needs a bill.   Sponsored by?
  You?   You're smarter than that.
  Somebody with legitimacy.   Good.
And who screams of legitimacy in education?
  Donald Blythe?   Correct, the problem is?
He's an old school tax and spend liberal.
Walker run as a moderate.
You think Blythe would talk to me?
He doesn't have to.
Wait.
We are in a very grey area ethically, legally
which I'm okay with...
I just love this painting, don't you?
We are in the same boat now, Zoe.
Take care not to tip it over,
I can only save one of us from drowning.
He announces the education initiative on Monday.
Half of the address is based on...
  I understand.   Do we need to take it out?
We're fine, Linda.
But you just got through saying he has to start over.
I didn't choose Blythe, you did.
You put him in my lap and ask me to work a miracle,
and I will. Now have a little faith, Linda.
Let me work with Donald on this.
I know what can be accomplished in a hundred days.
All right, Frank.
  We're counting on you.   Good.
Now I do have a little favor to ask.
Do you think I can get just two more tickets
for my table at the Jefferson Ball?
Drink?
Sure, what do you got?
Whiskey, blent.
If you're offering.
So...
How are things in the city of brotherly love?
We're getting by.
Good. Good.
Oh, sorry, I've made that neat, did you want...
It's perfect.
So...
It seems you've been a bit irresponsible.
What?
Don't play dumb with me Peter.
Save it for the Ethics Committee.
Drink up, you could use a little courage right now.
You're not having one?
It's a bit earlier in the day for me.
This is about the other night?
How do you know about that?
I'm the whip it's my job to know.
Look, they let me off.
There's no charges, it's all taken care of.
Honestly, Peter,
do you really think these things just take care of themselves?
You?
I was just this one time, Frank, I swear to God.
Then you must hold God in very low esteem.
Because we both know that's a lie.
Solicitation, control of substances, driving under the influence.
Got quite a long list of hobbies.
What is it you want?
Your absolute
unquestioning
loyalty.
Always.
Do not misunderstand what I mean by loyalty.
Anything. Name it, Frank.
You seem far too relaxed.
I'm not.
You shouldn't be.
Doug'll be in touch.
Hang on.
Where have you been?
I've been calling here,
everybody's been working double time for the inauguration,
you just up and disappear you....
Hang on.
Let me call you back.
  Where did you get this?   Wrong question.
The right question is how quickly can we get it up on the site.
I have to run this pass Tom.
Let's get legal on this.
Make sure we're not breaking any laws.
  You won't tell me your source?   I can't do that.
Fine, but if legal finds even one ...
I understand. How long do you think that will take?
We should get this online right away.
I'm not just going to scan a  page document
and put it up before we have gone through it every...
I did that already.
  The whole thing?   Cover to cover.
I've got excerpts, analysis,
three thousand words ready for editting.
You start go over that.
Get graphics work and table's charts the whole nine yards.
Janine!
What's the angle.
  Five words.   Far left of center.
  That's four.   Very far left of center.
Enough to put Walker on his heels?
Fuck his heels it's gonna put him on his ass.
What's up?
We've got a copy of the administration education bill.
  You gonna work with Zoe, do background cover.   Zoe Barnes?
Right here.
Whatever she needs.
  Shouldn't I be writting ...   She wrote it already!
And I want you to rewrite and rewrite it again.
You'll help her.
Tom, I am your chief political correspondent!
Go! I want this by tomorrow.
But I need to focus on the inauguration.
This is more important.
Let's get started.
That I will faithfully execute the office
of the President of the United States.
That I will faithfully execute the office...
Power's a lot like real estate.
It's all about location, location, location.
The closer you are to the source,
the higher your property value.
Centuries from now, when people watch this footage
who will they see smiling just at the edge of the frame?
So help me God.
Congratulations.
Today ...
is not about the next four years
but about the next four decades.
Now, you place your faith in me...
and I, in turn...
choose to place that faith in our children.
Our children are the key to this nation's future.
And that's why the first order of business for this administration
would be a comprehensive education reform bill
to properly fix, finance,
and strengthen our nation's school.
And I pledge to you...
we will have that bill on the floor of the Congress...
within the first one hundred days of this administration.
It was so nice of you to make this possible.
  When you called me...   Do not say another word.
I'm gonna miss Al on my ultimate frisbee league this year.
No, I'm serious.
A few of us on budget
have quite a rivalry going with the guys on Finance.
It's fierce, we get physical.
Anybody gets between me and that goal line
I will take that sucker down.
Donald! I've been looking for you everywhere!
Maestro. Here, let me help you with that...
I really like the work you done on the new draft.
It'a big step forward, we gonna make history!
Thanks for the encouragement, Francis.
Listen, I got some ideas about subsidies ...
Catherine! Hold on to that thought, Donald.
Don't you look stunning.
We Southern girls clean up well
when we get out of our Daisy Dukes,
and enter some Vera Wang.
And we southern boys are slow with our words,
but we're fast on our feet.
May I have the honor?
You most certainly may.
  Morning, Freddie!   Morning Frank.
  How's tricks?   I can't kick.
  Want to go on in?   No, why don't you set me up outside.
Outside? But it's freezing out here.
Well, a little cold never hurt anybody.
Anything you say, Frank.
It'll be right up.
My one guilty pleasure is a good rack of ribs,
in the morning.
Got the whole place to myself.
Freddie sometimes opens up just for me.
Where I come from, South Carolina,
people did have two pennys to rub together.
A rack of ribs was a luxury, like ...
Christmas in July.
Fuck...
The website is absolutely crazy.
Blue Camry DC plate number WJ
wanted in connection to canid hit and run
code  file by capital...
Do you want seconds, Frank?
I better not.
Tell you what, Freddie?
Yes I will.
I'm feeling a hunger today.House.of.Cards.SE
You know what I like about people?
They stack so well.
Let me get this for you.
  Want the paper?   No.
This is too much.
It's not half enough.
Thanks for opening up for me.
Any time, day or night. You know that.
In a town where everyone's so carefully reinventing themselves,
what I like about Freddy
is that he doesn't even pretend to change.
Ooh. I'm late.
Every Tuesday I sit down with the speaker and the majority leader
to discuss the week's agenda.
Well, discuss is probably the wrong word.
They talk while I sit quietly
and imaging their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet.
Vasquez must be shitting herself.
Shitting herself, when Walker is shitting himself
and shoveling his shit on her shit.
Bob, I'm planning on eating.
Do we have a backup on the docket?
You're on that, right, Frank?
Yeah, I'm working with my staff  
Republicans are gonna ram this up our ass.
I would if I was them.
Why, even if we squeak it through the house,
watch them mangle it in the senate.,
Or filibuster.
Why, sure, if it looks anything like this...
I don't know why Walker's
trying to tackle a charging elephant.
It's madness.
Congressmen, sorry to interrupt,
but I saw you sitting over here  
Remy. Gentlemen, this is Remy Danton.
Remy, this is Speaker Birch and Congress  
I'm well aware. Mr. Speaker, Congressman.
Remy just made partner at Glendon Hill.
Glendon Hill? Great team over there.
  Congratulations.   Thank you.
When was the last time they added a partner?
It's been a while.
Well, they know a winner when they see one.
Remy was the best press secretary I ever had.
Why did you let him go?
I didn't. They stole him away.
What accounts do you have?
San Corp Industries is my main one.
I run that account now.
Anyhow, I'll let you get back to it.
Sorry again to interrupt.
No problem.
Very nice to meet you both.
  Nice.   Lobbyists keep getting younger and younger.
He's probably making more than all of us combined.
Gentlemen, this one's on me.
I'm gonna track down that check.
Glendon Hill fronts San Corp Industries.
San Corp is deep into natural gas.
I don't give a hoot about natural gas,
but I have  deputy whips,
and they all need cash to win races.
San Corp helps me purchase loyalty,
and in return they expect mine.
It's degrading, I know,
but when the tit's that big,
everybody gets in line.
Tell them I'm on top of it.
I need more than that.
You are well aware that I do not drop the ball on things like this, Remy.
Promises, Frank.
Secretary of State, Argentine and off shore drilling contracts  
Talk to me when I've solved the problem.
Don't waste my time when I'm working on solving the problem.
When there's billions on the line,
You can't not call me back.
I can't not show up.
Fine. Thank you for your diligence.
Eight figures to you and the D triple C.
I know.
Don't make them throw money at your challenger next cycle.
You've made your point.
Have I? I hope so.
Such a waste of talent.
He chose money over power  
In this town, a mistake nearly everyone makes.
Money is the McMansion in Sarasota
that starts falling apart after ten years.
Power is the old stone building
that stands for centuries.
I cannot respect someone who doesn't see the difference.
What am I looking at?
The Williams register.
  Williams?   College.
September '.
And why am I looking at it?
The editorial.
Not that interesting.
Michael Kern went to Williams.
Check out the masthead.
And then there's this.
It's thin.
The guy's a unicorn. He pisses rainbows.
  You think we can get traction with this?   I think you could.
Linda Vasquez is on the phone.
Ah, I'm surprised it took her this long.
It's only  past :.
Which means she read the Herald  hours ago
and spent the past    getting reamed by the president.
Tell her I'm on my way.
You were supposed to keep Donald in line.
You assured me that you  
We got between the mother bear and her cub.
It's a setback. That's all.
On our first day in office.
Linda, I've worked with four presidents.
Setbacks are a dime a dozen with a bill of this size.
Frank, if you can't control this  
I don't take well to being micromanaged, Linda.
You want to do my job for me and run the White House?
Good luck. I won't stand in your way.
Okay, Frank. Fine. This is yours now.
If this thing can't make it to the floor in the first  days,
then I'll let you explain to the president
why he lied to the American people.
I'm gonna get back to work.
Please do.
Well, we really should be doing this on a Friday
instead of a Wednesday.
If we do it on a Friday,
  people have the weekend     Fine. We'll do it on Friday.
Is all the paperwork ready?
Some of the more senior people are trickier.
There's severance.
But we shouldn't run into any legal issues.
No, no. We use at-will employment contracts across the board.
Well, get started first thing Friday.
I want all of the exit interviews done by lunch.
Claire, I just can't help but think that this is a mistake.
We've discussed this already, Evelyn.
I know, I know, but I just have to say it
for the sake of my conscience.
I think that you are dismantling
what we have built over the past ten years,
and I  
and I think the way you're handling this is...
is cruel.
It's not easy, Evelyn.
But it's necessary.
You have always asked me to be honest with you.
It's how we work together.
I disagree with something, I say it.
Well, I disagree  .
Please, Claire, don't do this.
I respect your opinion, Evelyn,
and I appreciate you sharing it with me,
but I'm not going to change my mind.
Friday, then.
If that's what you want.
This is major reform, a complete overhaul.
That would usually take months.
Well, we only have days, not months.
But think about the process. We can't just change  
When I ask my colleagues, your bosses,
who are the smartest minds in education,
out of hundreds, we arrived at you  
the six of you in this room.
Now, I realize it is a difficult task,
but we have the opportunity to make history here.
And I want all of us to make it together.
So good luck. We're counting on you.
Page .
These bullet points reflect
the key planks at the center of our bill.
Get comfy.
This is your home until we have a presentable first draft.
Donald, what a morning.
I have no idea how they got this.
I specifically told my staff to destroy everything.
  I can't imagine    It doesn't matter how it happened.
We can't make it unhappen, so we have to adapt.
Don't they realize that this is a first draft?
All we have here really is a perception problem.
We don't get a second chance at a first impression, Donald.
You know that. Now, look, I'm on your side,
but Linda is furious.
What's she saying?
They want to point fingers.
At me?
I told her we cannot do that.
I mean, you are vital to this process.
I'm up to here with them, Donald  
for lying, for turning their back on you.
You know, I'm of a mind to say screw it.
I'll fall on this grenade myself,
just to piss them off.
Give me John King at CNN.
Wait, Frank. This is not your fault.
No, we have to protect your reputation.
But you're the man that needs to get the bill through the house.
I will   hang on. I will assign it to one of my deputies,
quietly manage it, and I'll help guide you through the process.
I am not comfortable with this.
Well, then what do you suggest we do?
What a martyr craves more than anything
is a sword to fall on,
so you sharpen the blade,
hold it at just the right angle,
and then , ,   
It should be me.
It was my bill.
No. Impossible. Donald,
education has been your life's work.
The truth is my heart is not in this fight.
You know me. I'm not a wheeler dealer.
I can put my mind to policy,
but I'm no good at this brand of politics.
Well, if not you, then who?
It should be you, Frank.
You're formidable. People respect you.
They will follow your lead. Let me  
let me be on the sidelines for this.
Well, I could only consider that as an option
if I knew that I could still come to you for counsel.
Of course. Whatever you need.
Part of me is glad this got leaked.
Well, it would have been better if it hadn't,
but at least people know where I stand.
Thank you, Donald.
Happy to do it, Frank.
He has no idea we've got six kids in the next room
already working on a new draft.
Stamper! But why dampen his mood by telling him?
We just gave him a great gift  
a chance to fulfill his destiny.
Write up a statement for Blythe  
stepping aside, fresh ideas,
et cetera, et cetera, and make it dignified.
He's a good man.
Oh. And bring me that Williams editorial.
After careful thought and discussion with my staff,
I am relinquishing my management of the education reform act.
I hope to remain a part of the process,
but I won't be working  
Why did you leak the draft?
I'm not exactly sure how it got leaked,
but, uh, it does represent  
It came from your office, though, correct?
Uh, we wrote it, but I don't  
Who'll be managing the bill now?
Frank Underwood.
Was that your choice,
or did the administration  
I feel very confident
placing the bill in Frank's capable hands.
Ms. Barnes.
How very deep throat of you.
Well, I can't help you dispatch a president.
How about a senator?
The editorial on the Camp David Accords.
"It is the opinion of this newspaper
that President Carter demand Israel
withdraw all its citizens
from the Gaza Strip and West Bank."
"Which it has illegally occupied since ."
Illegally occupied.
That's quite an incendiary quote, don't you think?
For an administration that says
that the Middle East is its top foreign policy priority.
Michael Kern?
Did he personally write the editorial?
He was the editor.
But did he write it himself?
Then there's no story.
I'm saying it's a question worth asking.
And if he denies involvement?
He will. Let him.
This is a man trying to be confirmed as Secretary of State.
Everything is a story.
There's no direct link.
I can't get this past Hammerchmidt.
Remember this moment when you resisted me,
when you said the words "Then there is no story."
Get a good night's sleep, Ms. Barnes.
You have a big day tomorrow.
Francis?
What is this?
What does it look like?
But the basement is mine.
I know. It's not for me.
So who's it for?
For you.
There's a gym in the Capitol.
Which you never use.
Because I'm a tad busy running the country.
But not at home, so now you have no excuse.
I want it out.
Give it a try first.
Is this your subtle way of saying that I'm out of shape?
No, it's my way of suggesting
you could be in better shape.
That sounds both passive-aggressive
and condescending.
Just plain aggressive and true.
Don't wait up for me.
Are you going running now?
Yes, because I couldn't this morning.
I had an early meeting.
Use the monstrosity. It's freezing out.
You break it in.
It looks positively medieval, doesn't it?
And to turn my only sanctuary into a fitness dungeon.
I won't have it.
It's a stretch.
We're not misleading anyone.
  He was the editor.   Did you call for a comment?
I tried three times.
The press secretary said he'd get back to me.
  He didn't.   What about research?
You couldn't find anything to echo the editorial?
No quotes, no op-ed pieces?
Don't you think if something like that existed,
someone would have printed it by now?
Nobody else has this, Lucas.
I don't think there's a story here.
I'm not saying there's a story.
All I'm saying is that there's a question that needs to be answered.
This is a nominee for Secretary of State.
We have an editorial on Palestine and Israel.
Which he didn't write.
Which we don't know he didn't write.
Exactly.
We don't have to print it.
I could just scan the thing, stick it on a site,
and tweet the link.
But if I did that, some other paper might  
Whoa, whoa. Don't be a bitch.
I'll talk to Tom.
That's all I was asking.
We simply can't afford to allow the  
We got a guy who's almost perfect.
He's a libertarian drug fiend marinating in a mobile home.
I didn't agree with President Reagan on many things,
but there was some merit to the notion of trickle-down economics,
and I feel there is much merit to the idea of trickle-down diplomacy.
If we can solve...
Those are my lines.
Vasquez must have given them to him.
...stalemate between Israel and Palestine,
that success will trickle down,
to a hundred other diplomatic dilemmas between Muslims,
Jews, Christians  
I'm glad you brought up Israel and Palestine
because just before we came on the air,
I received an advance copy of an article
that's going to be in tomorrow's washington Herald's front page
and was written by Zoe Barnes,
and in it she quotes
an editorial that ran in the Williams College register
when you were editor back in September ,
which called the Israeli presence
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, quote,
an illegal occupation.
  Can I see that?   Sure.
Did you write those words, "Illegal occupation"?
No. I have no memory of this.
But you were the editor of the paper.
Yes, but  
So it couldn't have gone out without your approval.
No, of course not, but my staff  
somebody else usually wrote the, uh,
the, uh   and then we'd vote, and if  
Did you vote for it?
Honestly, George, I can't remember.
It was  years ago.
So you're not sure
whether or not you supported these words  
I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt
I did not write these words.
But were they in line with your thinking at the time?
This is ludicrous.
I know it was a long time ago, I understand that.,That's all we need   him laughing.
Nancy, get me Dennis Mendel of the ADL.
The Middle East is a vital American interest.
What you think about the Middle East is relevant.
You can look at my voting record.
Every single vote has been in defense of Israel  
So when did your views change?
What I'm saying to you is my  
What's important now, George,
is how I have voted
while I have represented the great state of Colorado  
I understand that's your position,
but a lot of other people are going to look at it and think
what you thought then is relevant as well.
Well, let me ask you this.
Have you ever changed your views since college?
Certainly, but I'm not the nominee for Secretary of State.
Uh, even if I did have  
It's golden.
This has not been my views  
It's a bull's eye.
What were you saying when you came in?
So, ahem, I found a guy
who was on the college editorial staff when Kern was there.
This burnout,
still pumping mimeographed manifestos
out of a trailer park in the Berkshires.
  You're not planning on talking to him.   No. No.
Peter Russo.
Good.
Sounds like a perfect match.
Dennis.
Any chance you're watching Stephanopoulos?
You look sexy when you're improving the lives
of hardworking Pennsylvanians.
Is it the improving lives,
or is it these fetching sweat pants?
Why don't you move that computer out of the way?
Let me see what that looks like.
Yeah, it's better with the laptop.
Fuck off.
You're not paying enough attention to me.
I pay attention to you all day at the office.
Hey, you know, I don't think
I've ever seen you brush your teeth before.
  Sure you have.   No, I don't think so.
I mean I know that you do brush,
but I don't think I've ever actually witnessed it before.
Well, here it is in all its glory.
Is that my toothbrush?
I don't know. Is it?
Yes, it is.
  You left it here.   Peter, gross.
Oh, come on.
We've exchanged plenty of fluids by now.
Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No. Toothpaste.
It's not toothpaste. I'm ravished.
No.
Go get it.
I have to take this.
This is Russo.
Yeah. Right now it's :.
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
I have to go.
Is everything okay?
It's work stuff.
What kind of work stuff?
Congressman Wallinski.
He wants to go over the tax incentive stuff we sent him.
Peter, it's : in the morning.
Hey, Peter.
I have meetings tomorrow.
I have a committee hearing.
Congress will survive without you.
Address, directions.
There's an e-ticket in your name.
.
You should head to the airport.
This is coming from Frank?
No. This is coming from no one.
You have the flu, and you're calling in sick.
  What's that?   What's what?
Is that a hickey?
Are you whoring around again?
No. I have a girlfriend.
You mean your little office romance.
What do you know about that?
When it comes to your life, Peter, and what I know about it,
you should assume that there's no such thing as a secret.
Stay in touch.
You call me on my cell, never at the office.
Good luck.
Knock 'em dead, tiger.
How are we?
Overtired, under-caffeinated,
but we're making progress.
Less than a week to go.
Yeah. We'll do our best.
  You'll what?   We'll get it done.
Somebody open a window. It's rancid in here.
That is what happens when six people don't shower for half a week.
Anything you need other than deodorant?
Yeah, this performance standards thing.
  The teachers unions are gonna     Leave it in.
  But we could delete it.   I'll handle the unions.
What else? Anything?
Conjugal visits?
I'll get back to work.
  Nancy.   Coming.
What do I have next?
to :,
, deputy caucus at :.
  The call list?   It's on your desk.
  My briefing for the caucus?  Next to the call list.
Have you been in the conference room?
Have it steam cleaned over the weekend.
In the meantime, get those poor kids some Febreze or something.
It's like a petting zoo.
You gotta see this.
But were they in line with your thinking at the time?
We do not consider the issue
of Israel and Palestine a laughing matter.
And he calls Israel illegal.
Well, he's an anti-semite, and he is wrong.
We would have grave, grave concerns
about appointing such a man our next Secretary of State.
It's too easy.
Roy, hi.
My name is Peter Russo. Congressman Russo.
I'd like to just speak to you for just a...
Sir?
Either you're lying, and you can fuck off 
or you're telling the truth, and you can absolutely fuck off.
I saw your web site.
I'm a fan.
And I brought you something.
Hey, babe, put some clothes on.
  What?   We got a guest.
So? Hey.
Put some clothes on.
Ice or no ice?
  Uh, no ice.   Good.
We don't have any.
Fuck. Echo, I told you to put the  
It's okay. It's okay.
I'll keep your secret if you keep mine.
A congressman, you say?
Right now, I'm just a drinking companion.
Well, all right, companion.
Have yourself a drink.
Come on in.
What will that get me?
I mean, I'm kinky,
but I don't know if I'm the girl you're looking for.
You're definitely the girl that I'm looking for.
Excuse me.
All I want for that money is your silence.
My what?
The guy you were with the other night,
the one who was arrested, do you know who he was?
You mean the congressman?
There was no congressman. There was no arrest.
None of that exists.
All that exists
is the money sitting right there in front of you.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Good.
Open your mouth.
Last little bit's for me.
You're scolding me.
Am I?
You are, silently.
  Is it the rowing machine?   You tell me.
It's the rowing machine.
  You haven't used it.   How do you know I haven't?
Francis.
You know I don't like to be managed.
I'm not trying to manage you.
I just don't want to outlive you by  years.
I must walk three miles a day around that Capitol.
I'm constantly on my feet.
And do you know how many calories the brain burns?
I'm not worried about your brain.
It's your heart we're talking about.
Use the machine.
She's right.
I should take better care of myself.
But it's the principle.
I won't be a slave to
anybody or anything you can order with a toll-free number.
We share the wealth in this republic.
I thought the whole editorial team pitched in.
Sometimes. Not that time, though.
But he must have written some of it?
No. That was all me.
What if people thought he wrote it?
Oh, fuck that. He's a fraud.
Nah, he's worse than a fraud. He's a fucking farce.
I'll tell you something.
He used to be even more of a maniac than I am.
  Chemicals?   No. Politics.
Oh, we had some nights, man. Long conversations,
dangerous fucking notions.
  Like what?   You name it   OPEC,
Pinochet, the fucking Food Stamp Act.,
Then the motherland sang her mating call.
O say can you  
Next thing, he's cramming for the bar at Bryn Mawr
and snapping on a flag pin.
Does Bryn Mawr have a law school?
My point is, he started goose-stepping in the marionette parade.
Left, right  red, blue  Democrat, Republican.
We're all dangling from the same strings.
Take a sledgehammer to the whole fucking Punch and Judy show.
That's what's required.
Thought you were a patriot.
Fuck, yeah. One of the few.
  So what's wrong with public service?   Public service?
Come on. You gotta get a grip on who your masters are.
The I.M.F., the World Bank,
the Rockefeller Trilateral Commission.
You bankroll their fucking death squads.
It's called FEMA  it's called alcohol, tobacco, and firearms 
NATO  Border Control.
You think Katrina was incompetence?
That was highly orchestrated negligence.
Look at Waco, Amnesty International,
the ACLU.
Smokescreens   all of them. Blood on their hands.
Well, exactly.
You want me to lie to the people.
I want you to spare the people another hypocrite.
What's in it for you?
Poetic justice.
Oh, come on. You're one of them.
Can a corporate sellout roll a joint like this?
If I wanted to do this thing,
how might I go about that, precisely?
How did it go?
There were a few tears here and there
and some anger,
but nothing unexpected.
I'm going to need you to leave us today, too, Evelyn.
I'm sorry.
I just can't have any doubt about the direction I'm taking.
You just had me fire  people.
I know.
I sat across from them in this room,
and I had to tell each and every one of  
I know.
I am  years old.
Nobody hires anybody my age.
I will write you any kind of recommenda  
To do what, bag groceries?
What am I supposed to tell my daughter?
I'm sorry, Evelyn. I truly am.
No, you're not. You don't give a fuck.
Eighteen people, Claire.
Nineteen, if you count me.
I have to...
I have to call my daughter.
I know today has been tough.
A lot of your colleagues have left,
and I owe you an explanation.
Many of those who left us today
helped build the CWI from the ground up,
and I'm grateful to them.
But it is time for us to evolve,
and to accomplish this,
we had to make hard choices
and bring in new people.
That's what today was about.
You have any questions,
my door is always open.
I'm all good for national and metro.
We've got space for political if we need it.
Janine, anything new on Michael Kern?
The White House is dodging.
You can't get anyone on record?
Not just me.
They're shutting all of us down in the briefings.
No one is giving an inch, even on background.
In the meantime, I'm working on a feature
about the administration's foreign policy agenda.
How it shifted from the start of the campaign,
  increased D.O.D. spending, and     We see you, Zoe.
I can link Kern directly to the Williams editorial.
  What?   I've got a guy named Roy Kapeniak
who was on the editorial staff when Kern was there.
Hey, Twitter twat, W.T.F.?
  Wait, wait, wait. Roy what?   Kapeniak.
A classmate of Kern's.
I have him on record saying
Kern wrote every word of the editorial.
Let's move this into my office.
Zoe, Lucas.
Janine.
Let me   let me, once and for all,

I didn't author that editorial.
Not a single sentence, word, comma, or period.
If memory serves me, it was Mr. Kapeniak who wrote it.
Why on earth he's trying to claim that I did is beyond me.
Let me further say that I'm
a strong supporter of the State of Israel.
As the most stable country in the region
and our strongest ally
It's Frank Underwood for Cathy.
...in any peace process,
because without the stability of Israel,
there can be no Palestine.
CNN right now.
"Without Israel there can be no Palestine"?
  I've got it on.   I would remind Senator Kern
that there was a Palestine long before there was an Israel.
His comments are not only ignorant, they are racist.
Get ready, Cathy. Things are about to move very quickly.
  ...his understanding of the Middle East     Okay.
  ...is so out of sync with reality...   I'm ready.
  Peter? No. Stop.   Uh, not now.
Hey. Hey, where have you been?
Oh, God, you're fucking high.
  No. I     Yes, you are. Look at your eyes.
Oh, please, just lay off.
You promised me it wouldn't be like this.
Cancel whatever I have for the rest of the day.
Kern is out.
They're tossing him?
Technically, he'd withdraw himself, but yes.
Can I say "A source close to the White House"?
No. You let this story play out on its own time.
They'll announce in the morning.
I'm sorry. If not that, what story are we talking about?
Catherine Durant.
As soon as Kern withdraws, you say she'll be the replacement.
  Is that true?   It will be after you write it.
Roy Kapeniak was you.
You might very well think that. I couldn't possibly comment.
You found him. You had him call me.
Kapeniak and Kern were appetizers, Miss Barnes.
Catherine Durant is the meal.
Catherine Durant.
Say it over and over.
Tomorrow afternoon, write it down,
and then watch that name
come out of the mouth of the President of the United States.
This is where we get to create.
Don't miss your train, Miss Barnes.
It's the last one tonight.
Zoe Barnes with the Washington Herald now reporting,
quoting a source close to the president,
as saying that Senator Catherine Durant will likely be the
new nominee for Secretary of State
after Michael Kern's withdrawal earlier this week.
The White House has remained silent on whether the president
will tap Durant for a nomination,
but a national Zogby Poll shows
wide support for Durant across party lines.
Catherine Durant has served ten years
on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
made numerous diplomatic missions to South America...
We can place our faith in her,
knowing that we have a responsible, experienced,
brilliant woman representing our interests abroad.
Middle of the road, team player, strong in defense.
If there's a woman that can
work with the joint chiefs, she's the one.
Durant is the way to go. It's a no-brainer.
The president should stop this pageant and simply make the call.
Why are we still talking about,
if they're going to nominate Durant?
Why don't they just do it already
so we can all stop talking about ifs
and start talking about when and what
and how Durant's going to shape up foreign policy...
So, history?
History.
I'm very impressed, Frank.
Good. With your go-ahead, I'll start the mock-up.
Have Birch and Rasmussen seen this?
Not yet. I wanted you to be the first to have a look.
I'll schedule a time for you to fill in the president.
Oh, no, no, no. That is your turf, Linda. You should do that.
  Thank you, Frank.   My pleasure. Thank you.
  I so apologize for everything     No, no, no, n  
it's not necessary.
Now for the real meeting.
So what is happening with Michael Kern?
Oh, it's a total nightmare.
You know who you're gonna tap next?
Frank, we still need you in the house  
No, no, no. I wouldn't dream of it.
We've got our education bill. I was just curious.
Somehow the rumor is flying around
that we're gonna nominate Catherine Durant.
  I'm sure you've noticed.   Is the rumor true?
Well, we weren't considering her at first,
but the president asked me to have her vetted
in case we wanna go that route.
  Interesting.   What do you think?
Well, she wouldn't be my first choice  
Who would be your first choice?
She campaigned hard against us in the primaries.
That's my reservation.
But you'd show yourself above party politics,
and I know she'd work all the harder for it.
Decent experience, respect across the aisle.
So you think we can seriously consider her?
It's not the worst idea in the world.
Where are you getting this shit?
What?
Your stories.
  I was just    Who are you fucking?
  Nobody.   Oh, come on.
You're a metro scrub, and now look at you.
You'd have to be fucking somebody important.
I'm just doing my job, Janine.
Excuse me.
All set.
  Is this your first remote?   Yeah, it's my first time.
Right into the camera, don't shift in your seat,
and there's no reason to speak above a conversational volume.
The mic will pick you up.
  You all ready?   Yeah.
All right. Don't forget to breathe.
Five, four...
We'd like to welcome Zoe Barnes from the Washington Herald.
Zoe, thank you for joining us.
I'm very glad to be here. Thank you for having me.
You broke the education bill, the Kern editorial,
and now Durant.
I'm just thrilled to be reporting news that matters.
And it's truly been a team effort.
Everyone at the Herald pitched in.
But, yes, a lot of firsts.
First national story, first...
Thank you.
Calling it a night.
See you tomorrow, sir.
But, yes, a lot of firsts.
First national story,
first front-page byline,
first TV interview.
I would wave to my mom,
but the cameraman said not to shift in my seat.
What a roller coaster.
It really is too bad. Kern was a good man.
  And now Catherine Durant.   Yes.
Right place, right time, I suppose.
  We like her, don't we?   Very much.
Question is, does she like Sancorp as much as we like her?
I would say that that is a very good bet.
But then again, I'm not a betting man.
No. You always like a sure thing.
When it avails itself.
  Good night, Remy.   Good night, Frank.
  See you around.   Hopefully less and less now.
Oh, no. I charged the wrong thing.
  What did you have again?   A medium decaf latte.
Med lat, dec.
I don't know how to get it to go back.
  This one and this one.   This one?
No. Let me do it.
I have to ask you to stay back, congressman.
What's going on?
Some guy was trying to get into the building.
When we said no, he started tearing his clothes off.
Nobody can hear you. Nobody cares about you.
Nothing will come of this.
Why don't you let these nice gentlemen take you home?
Cover him up. It's cold out here.
You heard the congressman.
Cover him up.
Francis?House.of.Cards.SE
Page , section . We'd like some clarification.
Section  has to do with the evaluative measures  
"Evaluative measures."
What we're talking about here are performance standards,
plain and simple.
We can't have that. We open that can of worms  
  Gotta take it out, Frank.   The Administration wants it in.
Then we're all wasting our time.
Well, look, I can cut down the frequency of testing,
but it's got to be part of the overall  
That's the thin edge of a two-ton wedge.
  No way, non-debatable.   All right, hold on.
There's no harm in hearing them out, right?
Frank, what do you have in mind?
We adjust article . Hand me article .
We go every three years instead of two.
Frank, for us to even consider testing  
Marty, we can't negotiate time intervals here.
If   I'm just saying if  
The frequency could never be more than five years.
Look, five is a little high, but if you can bend on that  
  Marty.   Wait, wait, wait. And it's not just frequency.
Veteran teachers would have to be exempt
if they have a proven record of excellence with the students.
Well, excuse me for a moment.
Corey, will you take the reins on this?
Right, so, article    in terms of exceptions  
I've been saying for years that we should tear it down.
It's vulgar, it's an embarrassment to the county,
but time and time again Frank Underwood
has fought to keep it standing.
If it weren't for him,
the Peachoid would've been replaced ages ago.
And Jessica Masters would still be alive.
The congressman needs to answer for this tragedy.
What exactly happened?
A  year-old girl
ran off the road texting her boyfriend, and I quote,
"Doesn't the Peachoid look like a giant..."
  And then she lost control of the car.   Jesus.
Orrin's making a big fuss in the local press.
And he's pushing the parents to sue Gaffney.
Sue Gaffney? It's in his own jurisdiction.
It's worth throwing Gaffney under the bus
to drag you into the mess.
He's after my seat again.
Has he learned absolutely nothing?
It's a full-on smear campaign, boss.
He's out to destroy you.
With this? It's a peach, for Christ sake.
Let him make a fool out of himself.
No, he will make a fool out of you.
If he spins this right, gets national coverage  
National coverage? It's a joke.
And you will be the butt of it.
We can't afford that right now,
not when you're in the spotlight with the education bill.
This thing has caused me so much damn trouble.
  I know.   So who should I call, parents?
Phone call's not going to cut it.
  You need to go down there.   Can it wait until Monday?
We get on this thing right now, we can contain it.
We wait until Monday,
then there's no way to know how much this is going to blow up on us.
I can't go down to Gaffney. The unions have just  
  We postpone     They're gonna be livid.
Marty's reasonable, okay? He will explain to them.
And they're just supposed to understand and accept
that I had to get up from the negotiating table
because some two-bit county administrator wants to  
I don't want to interrupt you, sir,
but this is not just about Orrin.
It's about the parents.
Now, you think about the lawsuit.
What happens if you have to testify?
Subpoenas, depositions.
You get dragged into a court battle,
there is no education bill.
We can't ignore this.
I just hate this small-ball crap.
It's called the what? The peach what?
The Peachoid.
It's a giant water tower in the shape of a peach.
I just googled it. "The Peachoid."
She was , Linda.
You're right. I'm sorry.
  I need another week.   No, that's not going to work.
The president makes his speech on Tuesday.
We've already announced.
Speeches can be rescheduled.
We have to show some progress on education, Frank.
The first hundred days is almost over.
If we push back the speech,
it'll look like we're spinning our wheels.
All right, I'll work something out.
Thank you, Linda.
Frank, these are the heads
of the two largest teachers unions in the country.
  I understand.   They flew here on a weekend.
Doug will lead the charge.
Congressman Phillips is well vetted  
They flew here to see you, Frank.
You're managing this bill.
Put this in the other bag.
And I'll be in constant communication.
Anything big comes up, I'm a phone call away.
It's a  page document.
We need you in that room.
I would stay if I could,
but this is my home district.
Now, Marty, cut me a little slack here.
We'll get it done.
You and I go way back.
Have I ever let you down?
No, you haven't.
And I don't intend to start now.
Hello?
  Gillian?   Claire.
It's so nice to finally meet you.
Yeah   I'm a little under the weather.
I don't want to get you sick.
Well, if you're feeling ill, we can  
No, no, no, I'm fine. It's just a cold.
Well, thank you for coming in.
Of course.
Shall we talk in my office?
These are really cool photographs.
Oh, thank you.
Adam Galloway took the pictures.
Have you heard of him?
No.
I met him at the Whitney biennial a couple years ago
and commissioned him to do these.
He just had a big show at PS.
I'm not up to date on the art world.
That's all right.
We're not here to talk about photography. Are we?
My office is over here.
You run into any trouble, you call me.
I got it covered.
Gene Clancy know I'm coming?
Just spoke to him.
Get to it.
Your flight is booked, leaves in  minutes.
Ed will be joining you.
Where's Steve?
He went home sick about an hour ago, sir.
I'll be filling in.
What's your name again? Edward what?
  Meacham.   You drive fast, Meacham?
You wanted to talk to me?
Come on, Zoe. This is Mrs. Tilden, owner of  
She knows who I am.
Mrs. Tilden liked your profile on Catherine Durant.
No, I didn't. I loved it.
In depth, uncompromising.
Normally I don't read things before they go to print,
but Cathy's a friend.
Tell me how you knew she'd be nominated before she did?
You want my source?
Tom says you won't tell him.
I haven't told anyone.
Well, I own the paper.
And I'm very grateful to be working here.
So you're not going to tell me either.
Which do you want, my source or my integrity?
Tom.
Move Zoe's piece to the front page of Sunday's edition.
Let me think that over.
You think it over as much as you want.
Then put it on the front page.
I've worked really hard to gain a foothold with World Well.
Six years ago it was just me and a macbook.
I understand.
And I had to juggle two temp jobs just to pay the rent.
It's your baby. You don't want to let it go.
Well, I just  
And you wouldn't have to, Gillian.
All I want is for you to grow what you've already built.
I heard you fired half your staff.
Yes, I did.
That worries me.
I let them go to make room for you.
I'm just not sure we're the right match.
To be honest, I'm a little uncomfortable
working with someone who's commissioning famous photographers
when I can't even buy my volunteers bus fair to the office.
Do you know who Nicky Hemler is?
  No.   Nicky owns one of the biggest galleries in Chelsea.
She desperately wanted to represent Adam Galloway.
I delivered on Adam,
and in return
she contributes almost  grand a year to CWI.
That money goes to impact studies,
lobbying efforts, research.
World Well could benefit from that sort of money, Gillian,
and we can benefit from your expertise.
Can I think about it?
Of course.
We don't have to jump into anything.
I grew up here, in the up country  
Bibles, barbecues, and broken backs.
Everything gets just a little bit thicker this far south.
The air, the blood, even me.
I try to make it down here at least once a month.
Every trip is a reminder of how far I've come.
I hated Gaffney as a kid, when I had nothing.
but now I've come to appreciate it.
It's not as suffocating as it once was,
except when I have to deal with the sort of nonsense
that makes me want to hang myself.
Turn left on route one.
Don't listen to her. I know a better way.
Yes, sir.
We don't have the money, Frank.
The legal bills alone will kill us.
How about a settlement?
I'll look at the numbers.
What's it look like to you?
Like a peach.
No, I mean what does it really look like?
As mayor, I stick with a peach.
As a private citizen,
well, it looks like the sun is shining where it shouldn't be.
There's a better way to handle this.
Really, Frank? And what's that?
I'm not trying to start an argument here.
You make it sound like I'm in the wrong.
No, you know exactly what you're doing, Orrin.
You're using this poor girl's death
for your own political advantage.
You're the one that fought me
when the peach farmers bitched and moaned
about me tearing it down.
You're the one that took their money.
  It's a water tower.   It's ungodly.
  Orrin.   This is cut and dry, Frank.
I fought to tear it down.
You fought to keep it up.
That girl's blood is on your hands,
and I'm taking you to task for it.
All right, I'll tell you what.
Dick Peters is going to retire this term.
That means there's an open race in the fourth district.
How about I help you lock up that seat?
I'm not looking to make a deal, Frank.
It's not a deal.
It's an opportunity.
I'll be just fine.
You may despise me, Orrin,
but the classy thing to do
would've been to invite us up
for some of that iced tea.
What are you doing?
You shouldn't run here.
It's disgraceful.
Have you no respect?
The criteria is a starting point.
They're suggested, not mandated.
We assemble a council of experts
who will determine exactly  
Nowhere here does it say who these experts are,
how they'll be chosen.
The president selects the council.
What sort of oversight?
We'd like input on the selection.
Doug, check with Linda.
Calling her now.
Okay, so now can we talk about charter schools?
Charter schools are a no-go.
They have to be in there.
You keep them in, we walk.
The same goes for us.
Let's not jump to ultimatums.
Well, let's figure out a way to reduce non-public spending.
All right, give me a few minutes to think about that.
We can't move forward without addressing this point.
I understand, but this is the cornerstone of the bill.
Let's talk it out.
Give me five minutes, Marty. I'll call you right back.
No, no.
If we consider settlement as an option,
we need to be able to pay for it.
But if we offer a settlement,
  aren't we saying...   That's my point.
We're admitting that the town's responsible for this kid's death.
I say make the peach farmers cough it up.
Oh, man, talk about a shit storm.
Y'all mind catchin' me up?
Wayne and Travis want to go to court.
I don't think that's a good idea.
We can't be pouring money into a settlement
when we can barely afford to run the city.
What do you think, gene?
I think that we gotta worry about the peach farmers association.
If there is a hint that we're blaming the Peachoid,
they're going to raise holy hell.
Who gives a crap. They gotta suck it up.
Let him talk.
I'm just saying that we need to keep them in mind.
She was breaking the law. End of story.
You can't text while you drive.
Yeah, but all a jury's going to see
is a beautiful  year-old girl who's now dead.
No offense, Frank, but you just got here.
We've been dealing with this for the last week now.
And where's your solution?
What?
You think you know better than us?
I'm just trying to be realistic.
Frank, I know you want to swoop down and save the day,
but there's a principle at stake here.
We allow ourselves to be extorted because of this teenager  
When Orrin gets a jury to weep a river of snot over this dead girl,
when Gaffney goes tits up
because you can't afford to pay a seven-figure award in damages,
when you all get booted out of office
and I lose to Chase,
then you can chew my ear off about principles,
because we'll all have nothing but time on our hands.
Until then,
you either contribute,
or you keep it shut, Travis.
Now, here's what we're going to do.
Gene, how much can we pull together
  for a settlement if we had to?   About .
That'll work. Jamie, get your boys down to the hardware store
to build two billboards.
Put them out a mile out on either side of the tower.
Have them read, "Drive safely. No texting behind the wheel."
  Got it.   And get those up by tomorrow morning.
I'll issue the permits.
And let's stop lighting the thing at night.
The peach farmers aren't going to like that.
Well, how much does the electric cost?
About , a year.
Jesus, you could put a kid through college on  
Let's use that money to start a scholarship fund in her name.
Meantime, you tell the association,
if they want it lit up, they can pay for it.
I'll deliver that message happily.
And do me up a budget and a plan for removing the sphincter.
The what?
He means the emergency valve.
That's interesting.
I always thought of it as a clitoris.
But it's on bottom.
I believe the clitoris is above the  
But if you imagine a woman on her belly  
Enough. I want it done.
And, Gene, give me everything you've got on road regulations.
County statutes, not municipal.
And do you remember that power line business
we pulled up at the last election?
Sure do.
Let's make sure we're rock solid on that.
Does this very expensive dinner
at least buy me an evening of mind-blowing sexual congress?
It was good, but I don't know if it was that good.
Fellatio good?
Hand job maybe. No promises.
Deal.
Okay, um, Peter, there's something I need to tell you.
I have been thinking lately.
You know, um, it might be good to work somewhere else.
So I did some interviews,
and the speaker's office offered me deputy LD.
Peter.
Christina, um  
I just thought it could be good, right,
if we're going to have any future,
to stop this boss-staffer thing and be a real couple.
We are a real couple.
I mean not have to hide it like we do at the office.
And it's a great opportunity.
The speaker?
Would you hate me if I took the job?
Baby, I want what you want.
I'm not   I won't fight you on this,
not if this is what you feel you need to do.
  Really?   Yeah.
And you're right.
This is a great opportunity.
When do you have to tell them by?
There's no deadline. I don't have to decide right away.
Okay, well, when you decide,
just, you know, help me find a replacement.
You know, give me a heads-up.
Yeah, of course.
I haven't even decided if I'm going to take it.
We don't have to talk this through right now.
I just   I just thought I'd bring it up.
  Should we get out of here?   Yes.
Let's go find the parents.
You hang back by the car.
It's a big crowd, sir.
If I get shot or stabbed consoling two grieving parents,
I'm a hero from now until the end of time.
Let's roll the dice. Shall we?
Sir, I can't allow you to go unescorted into all those people.
Allow me?
Let's get one thing straight, Meacham.
You are never to dictate what I can and cannot do.
The only two words I want to hear from you
when I ask you to do something
are "Yes" and "Sir."
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
Good. Then we're gonna get along just fine.
Mr. and Mrs. Masters,
I'm Frank Underwood, your congressman.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
I cannot begin to fathom  
You're right. You can't. You have no idea.
Forgive me. I don't mean to intrude. I just  
  Well, you are intruding.   Dean, please.
What?
It's his fault. Isn't it?
Anyway, I just wanted to express my condolences,
and say if there's anything the two of you nee  
Dean, you don't want to be talking to him.
We got legal action pending.
Look, I know what Mr. Chase has been saying, and believe  
Nobody invited you.
Nobody wants your condolences or your excuses.
Frank, please.
You shouldn't have to put up with this right now.
I'm sorry.
Well, that went well.
Hang on a second.
Reverend.
Congressman.
Nice to see you again.
I wish it was under better circumstances.
Terrible, isn't it?
It's just terrible.
This is so thoughtful what you've organized here.
Least we can do.
Tell me, are the Masters in your congregation?
They are. They come every Sunday.
Do you think they'll be at the service tomorrow?
I'd be surprised if they weren't.
I'm wondering can you do me a favor?
Anything for you, Frank.
Oh, the blue toothbrush is yours, right?
Uh, yeah, the blue one.
  Hey, Peter?   Yeah?
Where do you keep the light bulbs?
The lamp in the bedroom is out.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Here's what I think.
I wish I could be bigger than this, but I can't,
and I'm being selfish,
and I realize it's mostly about me, but fuck it.
I have to say it.
Please don't take that other job, Christina.
Anyway, that's how I feel.
I'm glad you told me.
Charters jeopardize our ability to organize,
which is reason enough,
but the bigger issue is
that measuring their success  
Charters schools have operated
under the same evaluative standards that every  
Apples and oranges.
No matter how you look at it,
you can't use the same standards to compare.
What, you're advocating a
more demanding criteria for charter schools than other schools  
Our point is simple, Frank.
Several funds should only go
  to public union school districts   Hold on a second.
Yeah, but we've already increased non-charter funding by  .
The amount going to charter schools is negligible.
It's the precedent, Frank, not the number.
We're setting a lot of precedents, Marty.
That's the nature of reform.
Well, some of them we can stomach. Some of them we can't.
All right, let's not get bogged down in abstractions.
Let's deal with specifics.
Corey, can you walk us through it?
There's a three-prong approach
to determining the amount of funding...
Miss me?
Maybe. A little.
What's it been,  hours?
Not even long enough to notice you're gone.
Tell that to Marty Spinella.
How's it coming?
It's coming. Slowly, painfully.
Hey, have we always had tulips in the front yard,
or am I slowly going insane?
I planted them last fall.
You did not.
When I was down with you for the campaign.
You've never gardened a day in your life.
Not true. I have gardened exactly one day in my life.
You were down in Spartanburg doing some sort of fundraiser.
Gene's wife came over with a bucket of bulbs,
and next thing you knew, I was down on my knees in the dirt,
earthworms and all.
I can't even picture it.
Neither can I, and I was there.
What else?
Distract me from giant peaches and dead teenagers.
What else?
Oh, I went for a run today,
and the strangest...
I   I don't know. This woman...
  That's interesting.   What is?
  Oh, a text just came. Zoe Barnes.   Who?
Oh, that reporter from the herald you met one night.
Oh, her. I remember.
Yeah, go if you need to call her back.
No, she can wait.
I'm talking to my wife.
That's okay. I'm going to bed soon anyway.
See you tomorrow?
I hope so. Wish me luck.
Mm, bonsoir, my petite Peachoid.
Disgusting.
  Good night.   Good night.
Yeah, all right, that's fine, Corey. Marty?
Frank, let me explain it to you. Here's our problem.
Frank? Frank, did we lose you?
Uh, yeah, I'm here, Marty.
Look, we can talk ourselves in circles about charter schools,
but here's what I propose.
In your profile, you go into great detail
about the sexism Durant faced early on in her career.
That's right.
When she was first elected,
it was still an old boy's club in the senate.
Journalism used to be that way, too, not so long ago.
I feel really lucky.
I've had lots of trailblazers come before me.
For instance, my colleague Janine Skorsky
was the first woman at the herald
to become chief political correspondent,
and that was only five years ago.
Has it been those trailblazers
who've allowed you to rise so quickly?
You've moved up from the Metro pages
to the front page Sunday edition.
Uh, well, I don't know that that would be possible
if Janine hadn't already paved the way.
So does that mean that
the herald is not particularly progressive?
I think that they are. Tom is very open minded.
He's the reason Janine got promoted.
That's Tom Hammerschmidt, the executive editor.
Yes, we actually call him the hammer.
The hammer? Why?
Because he's tough.
How tough?
He's, uh   Tom has very high standards.
I love him.
He's a   he's a great mentor.
Um, it can be frustrating at times.
Um, he makes you double and triple-check things,
and you want to get the news out the moment you have it,
and he makes you rewrite until it's perfect,
but that's what makes the Herald the Herald.
Is that a workable model in the Internet age?
Our readers think it is.
Well, you have a declining readership.
But I don't lay that at Tom's feet.
I think that that's the times we live in, right?
Should newspapers adapt to the times we live in?
It's not that the Herald refuses to adapt.
We have an online presence.
Is that maybe not adapting fast enough?
I wouldn't argue with that statement.
We could do more.
We've got a special guest with us today.
He asked for the opportunity
to share a few words with us this morning  
Our very own congressman, Frank Underwood.
  Good morning.   Good morning.
Thank you, reverend,
and thanks to that choir for that beautiful hymn.
I want to read, this morning, from...
No.
You know what no one wants to talk about.
Hate.
I know all about hate.
It starts in your gut,
deep down here,
where it stirs and churns.
And then it rises.
Hate rises fast and volcanic.
It erupts hot on the breath.
Your eyes go wide with fire.
You clench your teeth so hard
you think they'll shatter.
I hate you, God. I hate you!
Oh, don't tell me you haven't said those words before.
I know you have.
We all have,
if you've ever felt so crushing a loss.
There are two parents with us today
who know that pain,
the most terrible hurt of all  
losing a child before her time.
If Dean and Leanne were to stand up right now
and scream those awful words of hate,
could we blame them?
I couldn't.
At least their hatred I can understand.
I can grasp it,
but God's wantonness,
his cruelty,
I can't even begin to  
My father dropped dead of a heart attack
at the age of     years old  
and when he died, I looked up to God
and I said those words,
because my father was so young,
so full of life, so full of dreams.
Why would God take him from us?
Truth be told I never really knew him
or what his dreams were.
He was quiet, timid, almost invisible.
My mother didn't think much of him.
My mother's mother hated him.
The man never scratched the surface of life.
Maybe it's best he died so young.
He wasn't doing much but taking up space.
But that doesn't make for a very powerful eulogy, now, does it?
I wept. I screamed, "Why, God?
How can I not hate you
when you steal from me the person I most love
and admire in this world?
I don't understand it, and I hate you for it.
The Bible says in proverbs,
"Trust in the Lord with all your heart
and lean not on your own understanding."
Lean not on your own understanding.
God is telling us to trust him,
to love him despite our own ignorance.
After all, what is faith
if it doesn't endure when we are tested the most?
We will never understand
why God took Jessica
or my father or anyone.
And while God may not give us any answers,
he has given us the capacity for love.
Our job is to love him
without questioning his plan.
So I pray to you, dear Lord,
I pray to you
to help strengthen our love for you
and to embrace Dean and Leanne
with the warmth of your love in return.
And I pray that you will help us fend off hatred
so that we may all truly
trust in you with all our hearts
and lean not on our own understanding.
  Amen.   Amen.
Your job is to report the news, not be the news.
I was promoting the paper.
You were promoting Zoe Barnes.
Is this about how I said we called you the hammer?
Because if that upset you,
  I apologize.   You're missing the point.
I don't want you talking about anything that happens here,
not nicknames, not how progressive we are,
not whether we are adapting to the Internet.
Any thoughts you have about this paper,
you keep them to yourself, or you bring them to me.
You don't get on national television and sp  
I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to  
Don't interrupt when I'm talking.
You can speak to me like an adult, Tom.
You don't have to lecture me like a little girl.
You haven't earned the right to be treated as an adult.
You think a few front-page stories and some face time on TV
makes you the next Judy Miller?
You've got a long way to go.
Don't be so arrogant.
Okay, so you think when a woman asks to be treated with respect,
that's arrogance?
Are you accusing me of sexism?
Just making an observation.
No TV for a month.
  What?   You heard me.
No interviews.
That's completely unfair.
You want to make it no TV indefinitely?
We're done. You can go now.
Hello?
Gillian, it's Claire Underwood.
Can I come up?
Have you seen a doctor?
Giardia's not so bad.
It'll pass in another week or so.
  You don't have health insurance, do you?   Nope.
I'll make an appointment for you to see my personal GP tomorrow.
Medicine doesn't really do much.
You have to let it run its course.
Well, we'll let it run its course under proper supervision.
I won't take no for an answer on this.
  Claire     I'll drag you to the hospital myself if I have to.
You're going to the doctor. No argument.
Thanks.
They're about to walk. They won't listen to a word I say.
  Both unions?   Yeah.
Put Marty on the phone.
Hang on. Marty.
Yeah. It's Frank?
This isn't working, Frank.
Marty, you have got to keep them in that room.
They lost their patience.
They're upset you're not in the room, Frank.
  I'll be back this afternoon.   No, it's too late.
Look, tell them
I'll come down on subsidies for charter schools.
Even so,
they're angry about the performance standards.
We're not even halfway through this thing.
There's so much in it that they  
Tell them that I'll roll over on performance standards,
five-year intervals.
It should be you telling them that, Frank,
you here, at this table.
I know that. I'm doing the best I can,
but I can't be in two places at once.
Now, look. I promise you,
if you keep them in that room,
we will get through this hump as soon as I get back.
Marty, you are their lobbyist.
You know what's best for them.
Save them from themselves.
Okay, I'll see what I can do.
Stamper.
Do not let Spinella out of your sight
and lock the goddamn doors if you have to.
You got it.
Here we go.
I know you're a busy man. I hope we're not keeping you.
No, no, no, I've got all the time in the world.
This is ham and these are turkey.
And there's some potato salad.
Shall we have a prayer?
Gracious loving God...
Have you had this before?
This is the third time. I'm used to it by now.
Well, I'm not used to it, but it beats malaria.
You've had malaria.
In Zimbabwe.
That took me out for a month.
You make a lot of sacrifices.
I don't see it as a sacrifice.
You turned down a six-figure salary at Google
to start your own non-profit.
People don't get malaria in Palo Alto.
You do your research.
When it's someone I care about.
Claire, I turned down that job
because I would've hated myself.
It was a lot of money, but for what?
So they could fulfill their diversity quota
with an Asian girl peddling a Stanford degree?
Not just any Asian girl.
A valedictorian.
Let me offer you what Google couldn't.
I know what it is
to be capable and beautiful and ambitious
and be on people like Sergey and Larry's
checklist of things that look good to have on a shelf.
I'm not trying to acquisition you.
What I see in you is a woman I admire,
which doesn't happen often.
I want to enable you.
I want to clear the way for you
so that you can achieve what you want to achieve,
on your own terms.
Thanks for the tea.
And I will send a car to pick you up for the doctor tomorrow.
When you're back on your feet,
do you think maybe we can work something out?
Yes, I think we could.
That's her at junior prom.
Beautiful.
Here she is in her letter jacket.
She made varsity as a freshman.
I remember the day she found out.
Coach called.
Jessie starts jumping up and down.
"Mom, guess what?"
I'm sorry.
Don't be. It's fine.
Why are we doing this?
Honestly, what's to be gained in dredging up all this stuff?
Remembering the good things helps sometimes  
Not when it puts my wife in tears.
I appreciate what you said at the church,
but it doesn't do us any good.
Neither does this.
Well, what can I do to help?
You can't do anything.
She's gone.
You're right. I can't change that,
but I can make sure
the city offers you a sizable settlement.
You mean buy us off?
No, I mean help you
avoiding years of court battles.
Jessica was going to go to Furman. Is that right?
On a volleyball scholarship?
Yes, a full ride.
Well, I spoke to the president of the university this morning,
and we'd like to create a new scholarship in your daughter's name.
If you'd like that.
It's entirely up to you.
But, most importantly,
we have to make sure that this never happens again.
We've got safety billboards going up,
we're going to stop lighting the tower at night,
and we're putting the guard rails in.
Should've done all that before she ran off the road.
Would you like me to resign, Mr. Masters?
Just say the word, and it's done.
If it will bring you any satisfaction.
I asked the reverend once,
"What are we supposed to do in the face of so much senseless pain?"
And he said to me,
"What else can we do
but take what seems meaningless
and try to make something meaningful from it."
He's right.
That's how God works  
through us.
Will you let me work for you?
What you have to understand about my people
is that they are a noble people.
Humility is their form of pride.
It is their strength, it is their weakness,
and if you can humble yourself before them,
they will do anything you ask.
Tell us more about the scholarship.
What are you doing?
  Working.   On what?
The, uh, BRAC commission stuff.
I'm behind on it.
It's Sunday.
So?
You don't usually work on the weekend.
Well, now I do.
There's, uh, coffee in the kitchen. You want some?
Peter...
Peter.
If I decide to stay,
it's because it's what I want, not what you want.
I understand.
Which draft are you reading of the written testimony?
The one you sent on Thursday.
I actually changed it on Friday.
Can I show you?
Yeah, I was thinking that we could start with job numbers
and then go to economic multipliers
instead of the other way around.
What do you think?
Let's see what it looks like.
Picture this  
A  year-old girl
traveling at  miles an hour
spins out of control in no traffic.
She hits a guard rail.
But if she's wearing her seatbelt,
which she was,
and her car doesn't roll over three times down a  foot ditch,
which it did,
then that young woman is still alive.
But you know what?
The county administrator didn't build those guard rails,
so now she's dead.
We looked up the statute.
Guard rails are under county supervision.
Are you trying to turn this around on me?
That's not all, Orrin.
Your easement.
You see, every couple of years the Piedmont Electric,
they apply to bring power lines through Gaffney.
The route comes right through your lot.
Now, Gene and I always fight them off.
But this year, if they were to reapply, hmm...
Eminent domain.
It would be such a shame to have to tear down this beautiful home.
Fuck you, Frank.
You can't just roll up on my property and act like you own it.
Oh, but I can.
We just did.
I've won this district  times.
Do you think that's just luck and a firm handshake?
But I'll tell you what. I'm not a vindictive person.
I don't like for anybody to lose if everybody can win,
so I'm going to help you get elected in the fourth.
You get to keep your house. I keep the fifth.
We put the Peachoid behind us, and everybody's happy.
What do you say?
Well, that's all right. You think about it.
I'm sure you'll do the right thing.
Oh, and I'm looking forward to having you in congress, Orrin.
It's always good to have friends on the other side of the aisle.
I've been offered a spot on Nightline.
You want my advice?
I don't want it. I need it.
Close your eyes.
Okay.
. Nightline is about to come on.
Millions of people are watching.
Where are you, home?
No.
At the studio?
Yes.
And what do you see?
I see lights.
I see a camera.
And that little red dot goes on.
Tell me what you hear?
I hear my voice.
And those millions of people, what do they hear?
My voice.
And what do they see?
My face.
So you don't need my advice.
Hammerschmidt's going to freak.
You don't want to work anywhere
you're not willing to get fired from, Zoe.
Treading water's the same
as drowning for people like you and me.
Good luck. I'll be watching.
  Hey, wait.   Yes?
When do you get back?
When I get back, you'll know.
Hello, Nancy.
Welcome back, sir. Linda Vasquez called for you.
Tell her I'll call her in a couple hours with an update.
  Very well.   Sir?
Unless you need anything, Kyle has you covered.
No, go home.
You did well this weekend.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, and before you go home, can you do me a favor?
Would you swing by my house
and make sure these get to Claire?
Yes, sir.
And thank you, sir, for being so patient.
Okay.House.of.Cards.SE
It's there for leverage so that we can lock down performance standards.
You don't toss around their right to collective bargaining like a poker chip.
If we don't, they won't budge.
Has Marty Spinella seen this?
Not the version I showed him.
So you lied to his face.
No. I revised the parameters of my promise.
Which is lying.
Which is politics...
the sort you're well versed in, Bob.
Here's some politics for you.
I allow this to go to the floor,
I get murdered next election.
This is coming from the President.
Last time I checked,
I was still a Democrat, Frank,
and you were too.
Are you telling me the President isn't?
Because he's acting a hell of a lot like a Republican.
I thought Bob was on our team.
Just sit him down with the President ten minutes.
We won't touch collective bargaining.
Are you interested in my advice on this,
or do you just want me to deliver the message?
I'm always interested in your advice, Frank.
Birch is right. You're going to burn a lot of bridges.
The President should at least sit down with him
and let him make his case.
You tell Bob
I'm happy to schedule a meeting with the President
once he's set a date to put this bill on the floor.
The President can fuck himself.
This is the platform. It's what he ran on.
I don't give a shit what he ran on.
He can't steamroll the house.
And don't forget,
you work for me, Frank, not him.
If he wants something on the floor,
he's gonna have to talk to me directly.
I know you take a lot of pride in your manhood, Bob,
and it's impressive,
but as big as it is,
Linda can still shut the door on it.
Tell Vasquez the bill is dead.
That's not the first time he's pulled that stunt on me.
Probably should have held my tongue,
but I just couldn't resist the chance to see him shrivel.
Good morning.
Frank.
Mr. President.
Linda.
Let's strike the anti-collective bargaining provision from the bill.
Linda and I have talked it over, and I think she's right on this.
Tell Bob he can come by tomorrow afternoon.
Sir, respectfully,
I do not think you should give him the satisfaction.
Well, give me a reason.
Makes us appear weak.
There's an opportunity for you to establish your supremacy.
We should seize it.
But without Birch's cooperation,
we're fighting an uphill battle before we even get the bill to the floor.
Frank, we discussed this.
Sir, if you give in now,
Birch will walk all over you
for the next four years.
I can get this bill on the house floor as is.
I promise you.
All right, Frank. Show me what you can do.
Thank you, Mr. President.
That was her trying to take credit for my idea.
Advice she wouldn't take from me... unacceptable.
I will not allow her to sell my goods
when she cuts me out of the profits.
I specifically told her no interviews.
She disobeyed me...
not just once.
At least eight times in the past month.
She stays, Tom.
She has no respect for my authority, Margaret.
I said she stays.
There are rules.
There's a way of doing things.
If I have a reporter who won't listen to...
two freshmen girls are moving into their dorm room together.
One of them's from Georgia,
one of them's from Connecticut.
The girl from Connecticut's helping her mother put up curtains.
The girl from Georgia turns to them and says,
"Hi. Where y'all from?"
The girl from Connecticut says,
"We're from a place where we know
not to end a sentence with a preposition."
The girl from Georgia says, "Oh, beg my pardon.
Where y'all from...
cunt?"
You heard that one before?
A version of it. With softer language.
Tom, we don't need people who follow the rules.
We need people with personality.
We want Zoe's face, her energy.
We want to get her on TV as much as possible.
It helps us cut through the noise.
See what I'm saying?
I hear you, Margaret.
Thank you, Tom.
Thank you.
Come in.
Oh. I, uh, thought...
I wanted to say hi to Evelyn.
Evelyn?
This was her office.
I don't think she works here anymore.
Gillian Cole.
I came on board a couple of weeks ago.
Gillian. World well.
Yeah.
I've heard great things.
Remy Danton.
You work with Claire?
In a way.
Hello, Remy.
Claire.
  I see you've met Gillian.   Yes, just now.
She's doing fantastic work for us,
as you can see.
Red is completed wells,
green, uh, potential sites,
yellow approved sites,
and blue are the filtration centers.
Nice. So you liking it here?
Yeah. My staff and I are loving it.
Claire's opened a lot of doors for us.
Sounds like Claire.
Shall we head to my office?
Gillian, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
What happened?
Things got complicated.
San Corp was in a difficult situation.
I would have thought you'd step up
when things were difficult,
not hold the donation hostage.
Well, things are less complicated now.
The donation is back on the table.
I had to fire half my staff.
Now you can hire them back.
San Corp is prepared to double its initial commitment...
  Why?   Public relations. Same as before.
And what do they want from Francis?
Things are square with Frank.
We're only talking about the C.W.I.
But why double it?
Because I said they should.
The more they give, the more you can do.
The more you can do, the better they look.
And that's why they hired Glendon Hill...
to make them look good.
And they also hired you to get traction in congress.
Not in this case.
We want a long-term partnership, Claire.
This is an investment in the future.
We're not attaching strings.
I'll think about it.
They'd really love to move quickly on this.
I said I'll think about it.
Madeleine, you have to email me this shit.
I need it in writing.
And with more than an hour's notice.
Yeah, I know that,
but you have to understand we... we have a plan.
We have a way that we do this,
and when you...
Okay.
Fine.
Yeah. Yeah. Bye.
Madeleine has decided to have
a spur-of-the-moment trip to Orlando with her
latest eHarmony catch.
No heads-up, no warning.
The kids?
.
I can do the shipbuilders meeting.
You sure?
Yeah, it's just a public affairs team.
I'll brief you, and then you can call them tomorrow.
Go get your kids.
Remy came by this morning. To the office.
What does he want?
The donation's back on the table.
They've doubled it to   million.
  You said no, right?   I didn't.
He doesn't want anything from you, Francis.
Come on, Claire. You know better than that.
I specifically asked.
Maybe not right now,
but look, I invented this guy, all right?
It's a slippery slope. You...
Think of what I can do with this money.
I can hire back the people I let go.
I can help accelerate the funding for the projects
that Gillian has brought in.
Let's find another way to raise the money.
But it's right there at my feet.
Claire, I have too much on my plate right now.
I can't have San corp breathing down my neck again.
I can't have Remy...
Look, it is Remy.
He knows me too well. It's dangerous.
Look at the bigger picture here.
I'm asking.
No. You're not.
Claire.
I'll tell you what I told him.
Which was?
I'll think about it.
I know there's been some tension,
and I'm probably more to blame than you are.
But I'd like to put that behind us.
Zoe,
you're going to be our new White House correspondent.
What about Janine?
I promoted her to Midwest Bureau chief.
She's okay with that?
She wants to give up the White House?
It's the decision I've made.
It's just that Janine has so much experience.
I thought you'd be more excited about this.
I'm sorry. I... I just thought you brought me in here to...
I don't know.
To fire you.
Maybe.
Water under the bridge.
We're starting over.
So are you ready to take this on?
Can I think about it?
People usually don't have to think about it
when they're offered the White House, Zoe.
Just a day or two.
Janine is booked for a flight to Chicago on Friday.
I'll let you know before then.
I just need to...
Thank you. Thank you, Tom.
David Rasmussen is the majority leader,
which means he's one step above me
and one below Birch,
which is akin to being between a very hungry wolf
and a very quarrelsome sheep.
Let's see if he stays with the herd or joins the pack.
David. You mind if I join you?
Please. A salad, huh?
Yes. I'm trying to take better care of myself.
Good man. Diet?
Diet, exercise, everything.
You ought to take better care of yourself too.
Well, they should stop serving such good pizza.
Oh, I'm not talking about the food.
I'm talking about Birch.
You are never going to be speaker
unless you do something about it.
I'm very satisfied where I am.
  Oh, come on.   For the time being, yeah.
Time being never.
The only way you become Speaker
is if Birch loses his district or retires,
neither of which is going to happen
before you and I have dentures.
I'm not happy where this conversation is going, Frank.
If you want it, and I know you do,
there's a way.
Okay. Right. I can't...
all you need is a simple majority...  votes.
We're going to get at least  out of the G.O.P.,
and after that, all you need is  Democrats.
You and I make two.
Are you out of your mind?
Just consider it for a moment.
You want to collude with the Republicans?
I don't want to,
but I would if you become Speaker in the process.
Never been done before.
There's a first time for everything.
This is ridiculous.
The Republicans would love a chance to knock Bob down a peg or two.
And you want to help them.
I want to help us.
Bob will not play ball with the White House.
Now, you're a reasonable man, David, and he's not.
You know what I am?
I'm a discreet man.
You're lucky for that.
I'm not going to mention this to Bob,
but if you ever bring it up again,
I won't have a choice.
Looks like he opted for the herd.
Claire.
I'd like to put an order for the water filters
and the well-digging equipment for the South Sudan project.
Can we talk about the budget?
  How much?   ,.
For one project?
I know it's a lot,
but it'll be our flagship project in Africa,
and we would be the first organization there
to work on this scale.
I'd like to go over the specifics first.
I have the budget right here.
Let me just grab my messages, and then I'll come in to you.
Okay. I'll be in my office.
Any calls while I was out?
They're on the desk, and this came by messenger.
Adam. It's Claire.
Yes. I know. It has.
No reason. I was just thinking about you.
You're right. It is a lie.
I do have a reason.
I need to use you.
The White House is where news goes to die.
Everything's canned.
These perfectly prepared statements...
it's a prestigious job, Zoe.
Used to be, when I was in ninth grade.
Now it's a graveyard.
The only halfway interesting thing they do
is throw a big dinner party once a year
where they pat themselves on the back
and rub shoulders with movie stars.
Who needs that?
Every day since you started here,
you've begged me to move you up, and now...
My goal in life is not
to climb up the Herald's ladder one rung at a time
until I've got my own stationery.
Some of us value a career at a paper like this.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for that to come off...
Well, it did, and you skipped a few rungs, by the way.
Do what you want to do, Zoe,
but if you want me to be your cheerleader and say,
"Yeah, turn it down," I won't.
I would have killed for that job when I first started here.
Put Fichtner in the "Leaning yes" Column.
Don't you think he's a neutral?
He hates Birch.
Yeah, but he owes Birch for the ways and means appointment.
Put him in "Neutral." Who else?
Ramirez is a neutral?
Oh, this list is so shaky.
Any one of them leaks it to Bob...
No, what we need is one name,
one person who can deliver .
The black caucus.
Womack.
What can we offer him?
What does he need?
Let me pull up his file.
Here we go.
McCudden air force base employs , people in his district.
It's on the D.O.D.'s chopping block this year.
Who do we know on the BRAC commission?
That's dangerous.
The trail leads back to us trying to influence
the D.O.D. or the BRAC.
No, no, no.
What we do is we close another base.
We leave enough money in the D.O.D.'s budget
to keep Womack's base off the list.
What we need...
Is someone we own.
Dad, I'm hungry.
Coming, buddy.
Here we go.
With cheese.
Without cheese.
Um, dad?
Yeah.
That looks pretty disgusting.
Yeah, it looks disgusting.
It's not how it looks, it's how it tastes.
And a fork would be nice.
Shit. Okay. Hold on.
Hello.
Good evening, Mr. Russo.
There's a Mr. Underwood here to see you.
Uh... Okay. Send him up.
Hi, there.
This is Kevin, this is Sara.
Hi. I'm Frank. Nice to meet you both.
  Do you work with dad?   I do.
Congressman Underwood is daddy's boss.
I thought you didn't have a boss.
Everybody has a boss, sweetheart,
even congressmen.
Why don't you take your dinner and go into the bedroom?
  But I wanted to watch TV.   Go now.
Cute kids.
Yeah, I like them.
Can I get you a drink?
No, I won't be here long.
Yeah. Have a seat.
Oh, thanks.
Is that a ps vita?
Which games does he have?
All of them.
I have a console at home.
I play sometimes to relax.
I ought to get one of these for the car.
So, Peter,
we need to close the shipyard in your district.
The BRAC hearing is tomorrow.
You won't put up your usual fight.
You have zero testimony to add.
I can't do that.
Yes, you can, Peter.
I spent months on that testimony.
I lobbied the commission. My entire office...
I'm sure you've done splendid work,
but unfortunately it can't come to fruition.
  Why?   Politics.
There's forces bigger than either of us at play here.
It's , jobs.
I know. It's a shame.
Keeping that shipyard open is what got me elected.
Those people are my friends.
I'm not here to debate this, Peter.
The base will close.
The only question is,
will you make it a swift death or a painful one?
No way. I won't sit on my hands.
I sympathize that this is gonna be difficult for you.
And I don't know how yet,
but I will make it up to you, Peter.
I'm a powerful friend to have right now,
perhaps your only friend,
so don't defy me.
Love of family.
Most politicians are permanently chained to that slogan...
family values.
But when you cozy up to hookers and I find out,
I will make that hypocrisy hurt.
Did you get the present I sent you?
You wouldn't really call it a present.
Well, more of a gentle reminder, maybe.
Mm, more heavy-handed than gentle,
which surprised me.
It's not really your style, Francis.
But, yes. I got it.
I like that one.
I do too.
But the first one's better.
You think?
Something special tomorrow?
Adam Galloway's coming down from New York.
What for?
Because I need some of his photographs
for the silent auction at the gala next month.
You speak to Remy yet?
I haven't.
If you want to look inviting, wear the black one.
Hello.
Oh. Okay. Great. Thanks.
Adam?
How is it the world keeps spinning
and you manage to stay ahead of it?
David's on board with this?
It was his idea.
Then why isn't he here?
Well, we have to be careful until it's a done deal.
I don't know, Frank.
Think about it, Terry.
You could become the first African-American majority leader
in the United States congress.
Let's make some history.
You don't care about history.
You just wanted me because I can round up the votes.
I need the votes, and I do care about history,
but most importantly, Terry,
you know how to lead.
You're the head of the black caucus for a reason.
So David becomes speaker, I become majority leader...
and I stay on as whip.
Why don't you want majority leader for yourself?
I'm satisfied where I am.
Maybe one day, when you become speaker,
you'll bump me up.
This is the sort of thing that there's no turning back.
I can throw a cherry on top.
McCudden stays open.
How?
You don't want to know how.
You just want the headline
when you keep , jobs in your district.
   votes?    votes.
I can get you , probably .
It's so refreshing to work with someone
who will throw a saddle on a gift horse
rather than look it in the mouth.
That's nice.
I found her in a village outside Amravati.
Her name was Tiala.
She died three weeks after I took that picture.
Oh, that's awful.
You can have them all if you like.
I love your hair short.
Do you have plans tonight?
No.
Is Frank expecting you home?
I'm sure he'll be home late.
Get dinner with me.
What time is your train?
I don't book round-trip tickets.
It's going to be a while before I can leave.
What time will you be done?
.
I'll pick a place,
let you know.
Ah. David.
How are you, Joe?
I'm behind you. Let's do this.
Do what?
Keep your cards close.
I like that.
Hi. Yeah. This is room .
I'd like a bottle of the Weinbach, please.
Yeah.
Actually, could you make that two bottles?
Thank you.
Sit down. You're making me nervous.
  You still smoke?   From time to time, yes.
I quit. These are an illusion.
You want?
Sure.
What?
Not now.
Okay.
I should go.
  I just... it seemed...   I know.
We can't start this again.
When I end something, I end it.
So why'd you have me come all the way down from New York?
It was a mistake.
I'm sorry, Adam.
I should've kept it business.
Side of you I like the least.
There are no mistakes, Claire.
Hello.
More wine?
How was your day?
  Good.   Adam well?
He is.
We just had dinner.
I e-mailed Remy on the way home.
I told him I'm not taking the money.
Thank you.
I appreciate that this was not easy.
Well, we don't like easy, do we?
Oh, the evidence would suggest it.
Is it all right if the holburns come over for dinner Wednesday night?
I want Felicity to buy some tables for the gala.
Yeah, of course.
I'm going to need congressmen and senators there.
  You need to call in favors.   Done.
Not a few, a lot.
I'll start making calls in the morning.
Adam donated ten photographs.
That was generous of him.
He's staying at the mandarin.
And you?
Here.
But the proving grounds' importance
stems far beyond it's strategic geographic value.
A.P.G.'s research and development of military materiel
is central to our nation's counter-terrorism efforts.
The base houses research laboratories for preventative medicine
as well as a wide variety of training grounds for military personnel.
A.P.G. Is also a job creator.
It provides  million dollars in payroll annually,
and nearly half a billion dollars in contracts.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today.
Any questions for the congresswoman from Maryland?
No.
Those in favor of removing the aberdeen proving ground
from the list of closures?
Aye.
So noted and removed.
Okay, we'll next consider the Philadelphia naval shipyard.
Would the congressman from Pennsylvania's first district
like to offer testimony?
I have no testimony to offer.
Yeah, but the difference that we're gonna make...
Uh, Terry, let me call you right back.
Terry Womack?
Possibly.
I've had three members of the Black Caucus tell me
they're backing my play for the speakership.
Interesting.
I have a sense you've been disseminating some misinformation.
No. I'm afraid it's you who are misinformed, David.
You don't have three members backing you. You have ten.
I made it very clear I didn't want any part of this.
Yes, you made it crystal clear.
Then why are you telling people?
Because they don't know you made it crystal clear.
I have to go to Bob with this.
He'll think you organized a coup,
got cold feet, and are making me the scapegoat.
David, if I pick up this phone right now
and leak this story,
Bob will have no choice but to drop you,
even if he believes your version of events.
You wanna take a seat?
  Uh, Freddy?   Yeah, Frank?
You better make it a half order. I got a big dinner tonight.
Sure thing.
Slaw?
  Always.   You got it.
Here you go.
So, what's the latest?
Oh, you know, Frank. Same old shit.
Almost got killed last weekend.
  Here?   No.
State fair down in Virginia.
Me and my brother hauling this smoker down there,
and this fucking minivan had a fridge strapped on top.
A fridge strapped on top of a minivan, Frank.
That's stupid.
Well, that fridge slipped loose.
Boom! Right in front of us.
I had to swerve to the left. Barely missed it.
But now that smoker is fishtailing,
almost hit a hatchback in the next lane.
Swerved to the right. Barely missed that too.
  Jesus.   Oh, man, it was real.
But, you know, that's why God gave us reflexes.
So we can move the fuck out of the way when a fridge come out of nowhere.
  How them ribs?   You know how they are.
  You know I like to hear it.   Perfection, Freddy.
Perfection.
  You go on ahead, Frank.   Thank you, Freddy.
Well, this is a surprise.
  You usually text.   Where are you?
On the other side of the tracks
trying to find the meaning of life.
Did you find anything for me?
You mean anything newsworthy?
Uh, I actually didn't call to badger you.
Yes, you did, but that's part of your charm.
No.
I wanted to tell you that I've been promoted to
White House correspondent.
I'll have to travel with the press corps, be at briefings,
but I can work around all that.
If you need me. It won't change anything.
Oh, on the contrary.
This changes everything.
No. I can be flexible.
I'm not interested in someone who's flexible,
I'm interested in someone who's available.
So you think I should turn it down?
That's entirely up to you.
Well, I mean, it's not official yet.
  I could...   Oh, look, I've got to go,
but call me, you know, if you find yourself available again.
You see, Freddy believes that if a fridge falls off a minivan,
you better swerve out of its way.
I believe it's the fridge's job to swerve out of mine.
Hey, Janine...
Keep walking, Zoe. I really don't want to talk to you right now.
It's not like I asked him for it.
  He just called me into his office, and...   Oh, please.
You've been gunning for my job since the day you bounced in here
with a lollipop in your mouth.
Congratulations.
I'll send you a bottle of champagne from the Middle West,
wherever the fuck that is.
I'm gonna turn it down. You don't have to leave.
Are you trying to rub this in or something?
Please believe me. You should be in the White House.
I don't want it. I never did.
I was hoping we could go see Tom together.
I want him to know that we both...
Get the fuck out of my face.
I'm asking. For real.
I don't want the job.
Then you're an even bigger idiot than I thought you were.
Go. Before I get violent.
Peter?
Hello?
But the Bering Sea is a violent and unpredictable force.
Hi. Uh, my name is Christina.
  I work with your dad.   He's not here.
  Where'd he go?   I don't know.
He said he'd be back in a little while.
Uh, when was that?
When he dropped us home from school.
He left his phone here.
Are you dad's girlfriend?
No. No. I, uh...
I just... I... I work for your dad.
Then why do you have the keys to his apartment?
Will you make us pop-tarts?
An enormous  foot rogue wave struck the Aleutian...
It was just sublime, Claire.
  Thank you.   I don't think I'll eat for a week.
Does that mean no room for dessert?
I'd love to, but, uh, none for me.
Why don't you and I head downstairs
for a little Brandy and some cigars?
Cubans?
You don't think I smoke anything legal, do you?
  Dessert for you?   No. No, thanks.
But I will take a refill of this Chardonnay, though.
Of course.
Oh, this is almost out. I'll grab another.
I hate how they just hit you like that with no warning.
You get night sweats too?
I, uh...
This is very new to me.
Does Frank know?
I haven't... we haven't... no.
I'm sorry. We don't have to talk about this.
No. It's fine. I'm just, uh...
It's fine. I feel better now.
  Could I have a little bit more?   Sure.
Just say when.
Charles is driving tonight, so...
And when.
  Cheers.   Cheers.
So, you mentioned, when you invited me, the C.W.I.
You're having a gala and launching some new...
Yes, that's right.
We just brought on this brilliant young woman
who's going to help us expand our efforts overseas.
  So we'll...   Claire, I will
save you the trouble.
Charles and I would be delighted to contribute.
Well, that's very generous of you, Felicity.
Well, you were such a darling,
getting us tickets to the Jefferson Ball.
  Oh, that was nothing.   It wasn't nothing.
It was...
People in this town don't go out of their way to be nice to each other.
Fourteen years Charles and I have been here, and...
Anyway, um,
I'm grateful to have a friend.
How much do you need?
Christina, what the fuck are you doing here?
Shh. They're sleeping.
Peter.
  Hey, dad.   Hey, kiddo.
Would you take your brother downstairs?
  I'll be there in a second.   Okay. Bye, dad.
  Bye.   Bye? Where they going?
I'm taking them to their grandmother's.
I was able to get a hold of Madeleine, and I told her...
Oh, fuck. You didn't tell her?
No, I didn't. But I should have.
I told her that you had to travel for work,
which is the last time I ever lie for you.
Look...
what happened, Peter?
I'm... I'm sorry about the Brack hearing.
  I was...   Fuck the Brack hearing.
What about your kids?
After I drop them off, I'm done.
I am no longer your girlfriend. I no longer work for you.
No... hey, Christina...
I don't want to hear it, Peter.
There's no excuse this time.
I don't have much time, Frank.
I'll make it short.
  The President?   No. The speakership.
David's making a play.
  What?   He came to me for support.
My first thought was to tell you right away,
but then my second thought was to ignore my first thought,
because we have the votes, Bob.
If there had been a party revolt, I would've known about it.
We don't need the whole party to revolt. We need ...
Are you out of your mind?
People have been asking me that a lot lately.
I'm inclined to start saying yes.
Who are they... the ?
David and I are two, Terry Womack,
and ten members of the black caucus make another .
Is the President behind this?
No. He doesn't have a clue.
This was David's plan executed by me.
But there is an out for you, Bob.
I can sway Womack either way
as long as you make him the next majority leader.
And...
  The education bill.   Now we're on the same page.
I can't do that. You know I can't.
You're the speaker, Bob. You can do anything you'd like.
And I have to say,
appointing the first African-American majority leader...
why, that isn't a bad legacy to have.
I'm sorry. I changed my mind.
I thought about it, and...
Thinking about it was what those two days were for.
And then I thought about it some more, and I realized I...
Jesus Christ, you're fucking unbelievable.
Look, Tom, I appreciate the fact that you took a chance on me, but...
No, I don't think you do.
I don't think you appreciate anything.
I think you're an ungrateful, self-entitled little c...
Little what?
Little what, Tom? Say it.
Cunt. You're a cunt.
What are you doing?
Don't you dare...
You don't even know what I'm typing.
  Get out, Zoe.   Just a second. I'm almost done.
Get out. You're fired.
Whatever you have to tell yourself, Tom.
Get out!
So should I press "Send"?
I think I should.
Call me whatever you want,
but you should remember, these days,
when you're talking to one person, you're talking to a thousand.
Well, you'll say you wanted to spend more time
focusing on your home district.
You'll say Womack is the right man to fill your shoes.
You won't make waves. You won't do interviews.
You'll suck it up and be a team player.
This was Frank's idea.
I told you he was gonna try to blame me on it.
Ask around. Talk to Womack.
I did. He said you came to him.
He's fucking lying, Bob! I would never...
Shut up, David.
Do you understand how you're to behave when we make the announcement?
And if I don't play along?
Then the D-triple-C will pour everything it's got
into your primary opponent's campaign next cycle.
We'll cleave you from the herd
and watch you die in the wilderness.
Tell us now, David.
If you think it's best, Robert.
And just think, he could have been a wolf.
You made yourself available.
I quit.
Fuck that place.
It was a prison. I'm free now.
Congratulations.
Where are you?
  In a car.   So am I.
Where you headed?
  Home.   So am I.
To your home or mine?
Is that an invitation?
It's whatever you want it to be.
  You sound tipsy.   I am.
I just spent the last two hours drinking Long Island Iced Teas.
What's your address?
Do your parents know you live like this?
No. They haven't visited.
Are you cared for?
How do you mean?
Do you have a man who cares for you?
  An older man.   No.
But you've been with older men before?
Yes.
Then you know they hurt you,
and after they hurt you,
they discard you.
You can't hurt me.
Take your heels off.House.of.Cards.SE
What do you think of Darren Jarvis?
  At CBS?   He wants me to be a correspondent.
Not worth your time.
What about Greer Fisher at MSNBC?
Stick to writing.
Do TV on the side.
You're more than a talking head.
  How about Slugline?   What's Slugline?
If I said Politico wanted to hire me, what would you say?
I would say that that peaks my interest.
Six months from now,
Slugline will be what Politico was a year and a half ago.
Everyone at Politico reads it,
because Slugline's breaking stories before they are.
I wonder why I've never heard of it.
Everyone's a free agent.
They write whatever they want, wherever they are.
Most people write from their phones.
Well, if freedom and exposure are what they're offering,
I would say that is a meeting worth taking.
This Hammerschmidt thing is blowing up.
I think he might get fired.
There's gotta be , tweets here.
People defending me, people trashing me.
There's even a hashtag   "Gozoe."
We mustn't leave any trails.
All of my contacts are in there.
Then it's time for you to get some new contacts.
Don't worry. I'll get you a phone. I'll get you two, in fact.
One for work and a burner for play.
Expect them this afternoon.
Oh, and go, Zoe.
The reporter?
Yes.
Just this once?
I'm not sure.
What does she offer us?
A mouthpiece when we need one.
She's been very useful so far.
  What does she want?   Access.
A seat at the table.
Sounds like she's getting the better side of the bargain.
She can be controlled.
Are you sure?
She can. I promise you.
Okay. If you say so.
The moment you want me to end it  
I know, Francis.
I should get ready for work.
Didn't think you'd be in till later.
This is your agenda for the day.
Here's your schedule for the rest of the week.
These are papers that need to be approved or signed.
Over here are your one-sheets for committee meetings
and briefs on upcoming legislative action.
I filled Ashley in. She can cover until you find a replacement.
Christina...
What?
Thank you...
for getting all this in order.
Ashley can call me
if you have any questions about what's on your desk.
Is he here yet?
I put him in your office.
Marty Spinella, head lobbyist for the teachers' union.
He wants to rip my head off and peel it like an orange.
Why? Because I lied to him. But what choice did I have
when the truth would've ended the conversation before it began?
  I'll call you back.   Marty.
You fucking lied, Frank?
No, no. You lied to my fucking face?
  Marty, I did not lie.   Did not  
We spent the whole weekend in that room
pouring over this bill line by line,
and nowhere did it say anything about collective bargaining.
Let's calm down and sit down, and we will discuss this.
I will explain everything that's going on,
and we will talk it out no matter how long it takes.
No, no more. This is gonna be a very short meeting,
'cause only one of two things are gonna happen:
either you assure me right now that amendment is out,
or I'm walking out that door
and I'm gonna start launching missiles.
The amendment was never intended to stay in the bill.
It was just there for leverage, that's all.
You threatened to cut federal funding
from union school districts?
That's not a poker chip, Frank.
That's a goddamn dirty bomb.
Look, the amendment is not staying in the bill.
I just need you to work with me on performance standards.
Performance standards?
Are you fucking kidding me?
You agreed that they were already out!
You can't just put them back in!
  Marty, look     I have a reputation to uphold!
I am the one that made the union reps stay here for you
while you were in Gaffney playing with your fucking Peachoid!
  Marty     You tell me right now! Is that amendment in or out?
There is a middle ground here, Marty.
We just have to find it.
I take that as a no.
Okay.
Marty, do not start a war you know you're gonna lose.
You fuck me, I fuck back.
Stamper!
Marty and I have a good working relationship.
Or used to. You can see he has a temper,
but I can usually cut through that and reason with him.
But I may have pushed him too far, which is worrisome.
Friends make the worst enemies.
  How'd it go?   What did you hear?
  A lot of "fucks."   Well, that pretty much says it.
Let's think this through.
We've got the D.N.C. leadership meeting.
  What?   I'd say you could skip it,
but Birch just dumped it on us.
  When?   It's here in  minutes.
Why here and not the D.N.C. headquarters?
The D.N.C. is doing renovations.
They're gonna be green energy efficient.
Oh, that's a charming use of party funds.
We've only been in this space about three months.
It's cool.
Not exactly the Herald, is it?
Have you been to those offices?
Yes. Wrist-slitting was in order.
So, who else is courting you?
  A few people.   You mean everyone.
There were a lot of e-mails this morning.
That's not surprising. You're having a moment.
People are interested. I'm one of them.
But if eight minutes passes on anything, I get bored.
In eight minutes, I can be bored with you,
unless you keep me interested.
I think you can.
And I think this is the place
for you to keep the rest of the world interested too.
It's your call. I won't chase you.
I'm definitely tempted.
Take as long as you want to look around.
E-mail me your figure. I'll call you back with a counter.
This is our top priority  
Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania.
We need all of them, or Walker's a one-term president.
Pennsylvania is why he picked Matthews as a running mate.
But now we have to find a replacement.
The special election is this November.
Patricia Whittaker, D.N.C. Chair.
A rare example of someone whose head is in the game
instead of up their backside.
Competence is such an exotic bird in these woods
that I appreciate it whenever I see it.
This also affects the House.
The new governor will oversee redistricting.
We lose seats here,
that means we could lose our majority in Washington.
Well,the R.N.C. is backing Jack Swofford,ex-Mayor of Pittsburgh.
He's got statewide name recognition
and campaign machinery in place.
It's been three months, and we don't have dick.
What about the A.G.? Ben Pluckett?
No. Ben's got his eyes set on the senate in '.
Which he'll lose because
he botched a sex offender sting last year.
  There's always McHolland.   He's .
When's the last time he held office, when Carter was president?
Reagan, but same difference.
He has dignity, he has gravitas.
If you need someone to fill Matthews' shoes  
You can't fill Jim Matthews' shoes, so we shouldn't even try.
We need a fresh face.
The state has a weak bench.
Let's go through all the sitting Congressmen one by one
and see if anybody sticks out from the crowd.
All right. I got the list right here.
Okay. Go ahead.
Pennsylvania's first district, Peter Russo.
Cross him off. He's no good. No experience, no chops.
Okay, moving on. Second district, Gwendolyn Pierce.
Nah, Gwen's too controversial. Very vocal on abortion.
  And Caroline?   She's good.
  And the boys?   All fucking four of 'em?
You feed 'em.
You got any pictures on your phone?
Come on. Let's cut the shit, Pete, will ya?
What are we gonna do about the shipyard?
BRAC had their hearing.
They slated it for closing.
Yeah, and why didn't you testify?
We're talking , jobs here.
My hands were tied, Paul. People wanted it closed.
  I was under a lot of pressure.   From who?
People high up the food chain.
  There was nothing I could do.   That's bullshit!
You go back to BRAC. You talk to the D.O.D.
You talk to the Secretary of the Navy. You do something.
It's not gonna happen.
  Okay. Why not?   I told you. It's political.
Okay, So I'm supposed to go back to the shipbuilders' association
and say what now exactly?
That they're out of work because Pete Russo's playing politics?
I mean, Jesus, Pete.
We're the ones who got you fucking elected in the first place.
Now you're gonna turn your back on us?
You should go.
Seriously?
I just got here. You're kicking me out now?
Hey, I'm fucking talking to you!
I thought we grew up together.
But this guy sitting behind his big desk...
I don't even know who the fuck he is.
Where's the Pete Russo who knew how
to throw a punch when his back was against the wall?
That guy was my friend.
Every teacher in the country a month before school ends?
Doesn't need all of them. ,  states, that's all.
The A.F.T. And the N.E.A. can't agree on anything.
You underestimate Marty Spinella.
So which one do we target?
We have a better chance with the N.E.A.
You think Chuck Sloan will bite?
Cooperate   we'll give your people protection
and a place at the banquet.
Fight us, we break you.
He'll bite. Get him on the phone.
It's after :.
Spinella is potentially mobilizing
the largest teachers' strike in United States history.
  Nobody's sleeping.   I'll call him right now.
I'm sorry. Are we being too loud?
A little.
  What are you working on?   The gala.
There's so much to do.
  Did Nancy send you my list?   She did.
  What'd you think?   It's a good list.
Thanks for inviting them.
Is something wrong?
It's still not anywhere near what Remy brought to the table.
Sancorp offered   million, Francis.
I'm adding up the numbers, and we're only at half a million.
  I got Chuck on the phone.   In a minute.
I can make more calls.
Enough to raise a million-five?
I can at least get us closer.
I'm going to bed.
Don't move any of this around.
Claire, we made the decision to turn Remy down.
No one forced you.
I thought we were okay on this.
You're right.
Good night, Francis.
This is Adam. Leave a message.
Hi, Adam. It's me. I know it's late,
but, well, I was really just calling
to thank you again for the photographs.
I'm sure they're gonna be a big hit at the auction.
I hope you're well.
I'm sure they're gonna be a big hit at the auction.
I hope you're well.
Right this way, Mr. Hammerschmidt.
He's here.
Good afternoon, Tom.
Legal?
Did you say it, or didn't you?
To you and to anyone who asks,
yes, I did.
Do we really need them?
Not unless I should expect a fight.
You shouldn't.
Give us a few moments.
It's not what you called her,
it's that you let her leave the building.
I know how to run a paper, Margaret.
What I don't know how to do
is run a paper staffed with people I can't control.
Was she really out of control?
To my understanding, she simply turned down a new position.
It's her attitude. It's the way she turned it down.
Did you think to ask her what she'd rather do instead?
  Is it my job to pander to all my employees     My employees.
And if they have something to offer that you don't,
yes, it is your job.
We've been through this, Tom.
The paper's operating at a loss.
We need people like Zoe.
I'm very aware of how much we're hurting, Margaret.
Staff reductions, dip in circulation.
Each one of those faces
and every subscriber we lose,
they keep me awake at night.
Now, I won't argue the business side of things.
It's neither my place nor my area of expertise,
but know this  
Zoe Barnes, Twitter, blogs,
enriched media,
they're all surface.
They're fads.
They aren't the foundation this paper was built on,
and they aren't what will keep it alive.
We have a core readership that thirsts for hard news.
Those are the people I work  hours a week for.
And I won't be distracted by what's fashionable.
That's your resignation letter.
Hand it to the lawyers on the way out.
I'll give you some privacy.
No, no, stay. It'll be quick.
We'll get a drink.
We're going to launch right here in Washington.
We'll see how Congress likes it when the streets are
teaming with unsupervised school kids.
Then we'll phase out the rest of the country.
Everybody hold on for one minute.
What's up?
The N.E.A. is out.
Hang on.What?
They pulled out.
Why?
He wouldn't say.
Hold on for one more minute.
Chuck Sloan   get him on the phone right now.
I've got him right here.
  Is he muted?   Yes.
Hey, Chuck. It's Marty.
Listen, you can't do this.
If we don't stay united now, we don't have a  
You hired me to represent your interests, right?
How can I possibly lobby for the teachers
when Congress sees us splintering before we even put up a unite  
All right.
Did Underwood get to you?
Whoa, Frank is dishonest and manipulative.
You've seen that he's lied to us already.
Wait-whoa-whoa-whoa, Chuck, Ch-Ch-Chuck?
Chuck!
Son of a bitch!
  Where are you?   I'm at the office.
  False.   You don't believe me?
  Not for a second.   Where are you?
  About to walk into a meeting.   With who?
Someone I have to punish.
  Give me a name.   No name.
What did this person do wrong?
Lie to me.
How will you punish him?
What makes you think it's a him?
Hold on. I have to take this.
Where are you?
Me? I am not at the office.
You're going to give me a new one of these every week?
Well, I   I can't continue to  
Not without protection.
Nobody tells me when to work and when to play.
I'm not being unreasonable, Zoe.
If you can't trust me, we shouldn't be doing this at all.
Well, then, how do we establish our trust?
I have been very discreet.
Oh, professional discretion, yes,
but this is new territory.
You have a camera on your phone.
Pictures...
The kind I wouldn't want my father to see.
Well, I'm going to need more than that.
Lie back.
Use your imagination.
I want everything packed for tomorrow.
  We checked already, dad.   Oh, did you?
Those are my pink Nikes on the kitchen counter?
And you, Autobot,
what is Optimus Prime doing under my bed?
He better transform himself
into your backpack before you have to leave tomorrow.
Hey, dad?
Is Christina coming back?
Um, I don't think so, buddy. No.
Oh, I liked her.
Me, too. She's cool.
Yeah, she is cool.
And you guys gotta brush your teeth
and then check the rooms again,
and then it's time for bed.
Got it, pumpkins?
Dad, you know I hate it when you call us pumpkins.
Go before I turn you into a pie.
Peter Russo.
He's a drunk.
He is at the moment, a very functional one.
Imagine if he was sober.
Even so, you run him for governor,
people are going to dig into his past.
Well, we turn that into an asset, not a liability.
Here's who I was. Here's who I am now.
You saw how they dismissed him
in three seconds at the leadership meeting.
Patty Whittaker is very open-minded,
and I am very persuasive.
You think Russo even wants it?
Any kid who's made it from the streets of South Philly
to the Capitol Rotunda is ambitious.
We just need to tap into that,
surround him with the best people
and then build the machine and push the go button.
So you think he could win.
I think he can be a contender.
Okay, let's say we pull off a miracle and he wins.
What do we gain by it?
Isn't it better to be holding the reins in this race
than watching from the stands?
You wife is on the phone.
Put her through in here.
I understand that Pennsylvania's important for redistricting  
No, no, no, this isn't just about this race, Doug.
Expand your thinking.
Who else is from Pennsylvania?
No, no, no, not in Congress.
The executive branch.
The vice president.
Hello, my dear.
Nancy had my tux dry-cleaned
so I won't embarrass  
The Cotesworth cancelled on us.
I'm leaving right now. I'll come get you.
I've got to go.
What's going on?
The hotel, for tonight's gala.
They refused to let Claire into the ballroom
because their employees are union.
Spinella.
Yeah, he can go after me all he wants,
but to go after my wife?
No class. Meet me at the Cotesworth.
You got it.
Why can't we just move it to another place?
I looked into that. Everything's booked.
You have to reserve these things weeks in advance.
I've got Stamper online looking for another venue somewhere.
Francis, the delivery trucks are already at the Cotesworth.
I can't have people showing up at a different place
in case they don't get the email.
This is my fault. I feel awful.
There's a half a million on the line here.
I realize that.
And I can't keep having my work
take these hits on behalf of yours.
It's more than just an inconvenience.
I know. We'll solve it.
  Hey, I just got your email.   What did you think?
You don't have to send me things before you post.
Oh, I thought you might want to take a look.
The goal here is for everyone to post things
faster than I have a chance to read them.
If you're satisfied with the article, just put it up.
  Okay.   Are you satisfied?
I think so.
Okay, you are or you aren't.
Whatever hoops the Herald made you jump through  
  I know.   ...Let them go.
It's okay to be opinionated, Zoe,
and it's okay to go outside to get your hands dirty.
You're no longer tied to a desk.
Or that pillow, for that matter.
I'm not going to post it.
Midterm predictions   they're not news.
They're bullshit.
Well, I agree.
I can do better.
I think you can.
Feel free to blow my mind.
If we do this event, the whole staff walks out.
I've got  guests  
You signed a contract with my wife.
We'll refund your wife's organization
and pay for whatever the costs of moving the event to a more
appropriate venue.
And we would have to refund a half a million dollars in donations.
Can you pay for that, too?
Because I'm pretty sure there's cause for damages here.
I truly apologize, sir.
Who's your boss?
I spoke with the owners,
and they authorized me to do what I think is best.
And do they realize that they are shutting the door on  members
of the United States Congress?
Yes, sir, they do.
I had to make a very hard judgment call.
Well, I seriously question your judgment.
You know, word travels fast in this town.
All those luncheons and conventions and dinners.
It's going to be a shame to lose all that work. Isn't it?
Congressman, you are absolutely right,
but if my staff walks out, I  
Please understand the predicament I'm in.
I got an idea.
I know what we're going to do.
Honey, they're not going to let us have it inside.
We're going to have it right here
on their front steps, picnic style.
What do you need from me?
I need your manpower.
Yes, sir, I'm on it.
Okay, everybody, stop what you're doing, and listen up.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, Frank.
  How soon?   About three hours.
  How many people we talking?   Just .
The florist is going to send over whatever he has.
Great.
Francis, where are we with food?
I've got hotdogs, pizzas, and soul food coming,
maybe something else.
Girls, here's what I want.
I want four bars, two on each level.
The food can go there. The silent auction goes here.
Oh, and cancel the string quartet. Let's get a DJ.
Doug, how are we on booze?
  Kegs are on the way now.   Great.
Oh, and call Denise at the office
and have her bring every donation envelope she can find.
Okay, messages, people.
Congressman Russo's office.
Yes, can you hold one minute? Thank you.
Congressman, people keep calling about the shipyards.
We don't know what to tell them.
We just say we'll give you the message.
  Keep saying that.   Here they are,
the messages and all the emails we've gotten, too.
You want me to   Have a good night.
Who did we reach?
Herald, The Times, USA Today.
All right, I want affiliate stations and cable news.
I want satellite trucks out there.
I want this on live TV.
Okay, I'm on it.
You can't do this here.
Zoe,  P.M. tonight, Hotel Cotesworth.
Benefit for my wife's charity.
No, wash your face and let your hair down.
This is work and play.
See you.
I can tell you right now I'm going to need two dozen.
Paul, I'm going to need those by tomorrow, okay?
Your guests are your problem, not mine, Julian.
I'll close the gate.
You know, I'm no expert in fire code,
but I would imagine that locking your guests in
is a bigger violation than having them walk around us.
This is trespassing on private property.
You're breaking the law.
Right, okay.
Let me get Barney Hull on the phone here for you.
Here you go.
It's ringing.
Who's Barney Hull?
The police commissioner.
No? Okay.
You'd rather talk to him in person, that's great.
He's coming to the party.
I'll be sure to introduce him to you.
Thanks for your hospitality.
Bar comes over here.
Put all that booze that way.
What do you want me to do?
I can't lock the gates, and they've got the police on their side.
Unbelievable. Hold on.
Cassandra,
I need  teachers
at the Cotesworth Hotel right now.
I need a full picket.
I don't want to hear it. Just get it done.
I don't give a fuck if they're teachers or not, frankly.
Just get me  bodies.
You know, call the teamsters. Maybe they'll help us.
We'll give them glasses if we have to.
Tell the guys to look smart.
Charlie, get off the phone.
I need signs right now, at least a hundred.
You know what? Let them set it up.
It's actually better for us that way.
This way they can't hide from us.
You've put me in a terrible situation.
Thank you very much for all your help.
Much appreciated.
Here, we got the signs right here.
Let's hand them out fast.
Everybody single file right down the street.
This way, that way. Okay?
Well, at least he spelled it right.
Teachers protesting the education reform
and achievement act have descended upon
the Hotel Cotesworth in Washington, D.C.
Union lobbyist Martin Spinella organized the demonstration.
Teachers deserve respect!
Teachers deserve respect!
Now, I knew you'd show up.
You bring that beautiful wife of yours? Hello...
Pleasure. Thank you for coming.
Come on in. The drinks are on the house.
Felicity.
Spinella got us shut out by the union,
so we had to have the party out here on the steps.
I'll take you up to a bar right now.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you. Welcome.
Teachers, yes! Unions, yes!
Teachers, yes! Unions, yes!
Thanks again so much for coming.
Adam's here.
You came.
Looks wonderful.
You're going to have to move over,
because I have to serve this wonderful couple myself.
This is fabulous.
Only Claire could've thought of this.
I don't suppose you have anything single-malt back there.
Frank, it's worth every penny to see you on keg duty.
Well, then don't you think this is worth just a few extra pennies?
Oh, let's break out the checkbook, Charles.
Did you RSVP?
I assumed it didn't matter.
It doesn't.
I'm glad you're here.
When I heard your message.
You know, I shouldn't have left that, Adam.
Why not?
Maybe we should talk at some point.
Make that check with a lot of zeroes, won't you?
There we are.
  Cheers.   Cheers.
Cheers.
I'm going to ask a huge favor of you since you're here.
You want to put me to work.
Yes, please.
  My pleasure.   Come.
So these are some wonderful photographs
  by an amazing photographer     Gillian.
Adam Galloway, nice to meet you.
And this is the photographer himself.
Freddie.
I just wanted to thank you so much.
Such a success.
My pleasure. My pleasure.
He's the best.
I see Adam's here.
I didn't know he was coming.
  Well, guess what I got.   What?
Another check from the Holburns for  ,.
Come on, praise me like you should.
If Frank Underwood and the United States Congress  
Hi, my name is Zoe Barnes. I'm with Slugline.
...dismantle the rights of the American teacher?
Unions, yes! Teachers, yes!
Hi. Why do you protest here?
And Congress has to take this seriously.
We're here for the teachers.
We're here  
Thank you. Thank you.
We're not asking for the world,
and Congress needs to step up and get this done.
Excuse me.
That dress looks familiar.
It's the one I wore to the symphony.
Oh, yes, mutual admiration society.
That's right.
So what do you have for me?
What do you mean?
Well, you're surrounded by Washington's elite.
Are you saying you've overheard nothing
that could be useful to either of us?
I'm covering the protest.
The rest of the world is covering the protest.
You may not have noticed,
but you're the only journalist inside the party.
I've been feeding you plenty.
Information is a two-way street, Miss Barnes.
  Hello.   Claire, this is Zoe Barnes.
You met her one night at the house.
Yes, I remember.
You work for the Herald, right?
Not anymore.
I actually work at Slugline now.
I've heard of it.
You read it, don't you, Francis?
Religiously.
Well, you seem like a very ambitious young woman.
I like that.
Doing my best.
It's good to see you again.
Please enjoy yourself.
I will. Thank you.
Take care, Miss Barnes.
...on the steps,
and she looks gorgeous,
but what really she's thinking,
when can I go the fuck home?
  I'm off.   Already?
I've done my duty, I believe.
Oh, you know me.
Always have to be the first to leave a party.
How much did you raise?
Fantastic.
Write a check for , we'll break a million.
Nice try.
Thank you for coming.
And everything that you did.
Call me sometime.
I will.
So what does a Clean Water gala
have to do with teachers' unions?
Well, we have over  members of Congress gathered in one place.
But the fact that these members of Congress are promoting
pouring money out of the country
while neglecting their teachers at home
is precisely the problem.
But this is private money, not public tax dollars, so...
But we're not protesting the cause.
We're protesting the Congressmen and women themselves.
Are these even teachers picketing?
Well, sure, some of them.
And some of them are people in  
Excuse me.
Frank. What are you  ?
Don't take the food. We'll feed you later.
Marty, you know that old saying.
The most dangerous spot in the world
is to come between a teamster and free food.
Don't take the food. We're feeding you later.
  I'll take it.   She'll take it.
Who else is hungry?
  There you go.   Pass it back.
Plenty more coming, guys.
I know you've all been out here for hours.
Thank you, Freddy.
The best ribs in D.C.
Marty, come on.
You said your piece. You got on the news.
Come and enjoy yourself.
I respect you, Claire.
You know I can't do that.
Doesn't matter what side you're on.
Everybody's got to eat.
You can have a plate of ribs.
Yes, you can. Come on.
  I can't.   Yes, you can.
Thank you, Claire, but I cannot.
  You can do it. Come on,   Thank you,
  Marty. Come on.  I can't. Thank you. Thank you.
Freddy's. You should go to Freddy's.
Several dozen union sympathizers
led by labor lobbyist Martin Spinella
attempted to disrupt the gala.
They need to step up to the plate
and take care of our teachers and our children.
The protest dissipated when fundraiser attendees
offer food and drink to picketers.
Doesn't matter what side you're on.
Everybody's gotta eat.
Turn it off.
It is unclear whether the protest will continue.
What now?
Call the union leadership and the chapter presidents.
See if they're ready to pull the trigger.
If they are,
we strike at midnight tomorrow.
You were extraordinary.
Tomorrow, people who weren't there
are gonna lie and say they were.
What are you reading?
She can write.
She can.
And you can raise money.
Always for a good cause.
Thank you.
Wait in the car, please.
Hold on. I know who that is.
Hello, Peter.
I am starving. I forgot to eat.
Would you like something, Peter?
No. Thanks.
You should eat.
Don't fight. She'll win.
I will.
Okay. Yes.
You want some coffee?
Yes. Thanks.
Do you have any children?
Two. A son and a daughter.
Married?
Divorced.
What are their names, your kids?
Um, Sarah, she's ,
and Kevin is eight.
Do you have any pictures?
Fuck! I lost my phone.
I..sorry. I should...uh, I gotta go.
Peter, sit down.
You're gonna enjoy your sandwich,
have some coffee, and stay the night.
Milk and sugar?
Black.
Some fresh towels.
There should be soap and toothpaste,
everything you need in the bathroom.
Thank you so much for doing this.
Oh, it's nothing. Sleep well.
What's going on, Peter?
Talk to me.
You think fresh towels changes anything?
Changes what?
The shipyard.
If I was home and you pulled that shit,
I'd beat the fuck out of you.
I would crack your skull on the pavement.
That's why I came over here today,
to fuck you up for what you made me do.
I don't care how nice you're being to me.
I don't give a shit.
I'm gonna wake up tomorrow...
and all these people...
all my friends...
are still fucked.
And I'm still fucked.
You fucked all of us.
But I'm gonna get blamed for it.
So now I have to carry that weight on my shoulders.
You fucked me, Frank.
I shouldn't have let you do it, but I did.
Are you done now?
Get up.
  No.   I said get up.
And follow me. Now.
Get in.
Take off your clothes and get in.
Do it. Now.
There was a D.N.C. meeting earlier this week.
About the governor's race.
Your name came up as someone we might want to run.
Aspirin. Go ahead.
Everyone in that room wanted to cross you off the list.
I said no. I stuck up for you.
I said, "Peter Russo, he's got potential."
"He's young. He's capable. He's going places."
I made them keep you in contention.
You're still on that list.
You show up at my house in the middle of the night,
drunk, to whine,
to try to shift the blame on me
instead of taking responsibility for yourself and your own actions.
Maybe they were right in that meeting.
Maybe you are worthless.
I'm the only person who believes in you, Peter,
but maybe that's one too many.
The hot water will open up your capillaries.
The aspirin you just took will make your blood thinner.
It's up to you, Peter.
Oh, and if you do decide to take the coward's way out,
cut along the tracks, not across them.
That's a rookie mistake.
Morning.
Morning.
You need a lift to The Hill?
I should go home and change my clothes.
No, no, we'll drop you.
Want some coffee?
Frank...
One month.
One month sober.
I can give you that.
Not for me. For you.
Has the seed been planted?
Only Peter can answer that question.
He has a choice.
Will he wither or will he thrive?
Only time will tell.House.of.Cards.SE
We're almost a month into the strike,
and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.
Do you blame the White House or Congress?
I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers.
We're over three weeks into this strike.
It's costing the country billions of dollars,
and instead of offering solutions  
There's a big difference between
taking a stand and sitting on your hands.
I don't know whether to call it cowardice...
It's his agenda,
and the problem is that he stole sound, conservative ideas.
The only smart thing he's done
is lift his platform from the republican platform.
I admit it, Linda. This got away from me.
But we can't turn back time. We have to hold our ground.
While our approval ratings continue to nosedive?
Spinella and I worked together
for years on dozens of labor-related bills.
  I thought he'd be reasonable.   You were wrong about that.
Well, I didn't think he'd be insane enough to go on strike,
and I didn't think the strike would last this long.
So you've been wrong twice about this.
Why should I believe you're right about holding out?
We threatened collective bargaining
in order to get performance standards and charter funding.
That's the deal that we made. We took that stand.
We lay down now, we lose it all.
There'll be no reform, just an empty bill.
I understand the logic, Frank,
but we're in damage control now.
We can't close one wound by opening another.
But we're the democrats.
We're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.
But you can't have it both ways, Linda.
You can't have the reform you want
and keep the teachers happy at the same time.
You knew that when we started.
Okay, then if we have to choose,
we choose to keep the teachers happy.
That is a mistake, Linda. We've already crossed the rubicon.
I'm telling you this   the president wants to change the bill.
We should've done it three weeks ago. We didn't.
So you have to do it now.
Give me more time, Linda, please.
If I can break this strike
and get everything we want in this bill,
can we agree that's preferable to folding?
Of course. If we can count on that  
Then count on me for just one more week.
If the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.
  Frank     No. One more week. That's all.
This is the worst possible position to be in.
If I water down the bill,
the president will still see me as a failure.
If the strike doesn't end in a week,
I forced myself into a corner.
Only total victory will put me back in his good graces.
The alternative is exile,
which would mean the last five months were for nothing.
I cannot abide falling back to square one.
Does congressman need me, ma'am?
No. I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.
I just brewed a fresh pot.
  I'm good, ma'am. But thanks.   Are you sure?
My shift's done in a couple hours. I'll be fine.
No. Come on. Stretch your legs.
I won't take no for an answer.
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?
I was a cop here in DC.
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.
  Thank you.   Did you serve overseas?
I did, ma'am. Bahrain, then Afghanistan.
Served most of my second tour in the Korangal Valley.,
You wanna know if I killed anyone?
I think I know the answer.
I got a dinner meeting with Birch. I'll be...
I invited him in for coffee.
Well, drink it fast. We leave in five...
Get down! Stay away from the windows!
Stop!
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have
one of your best men covering us now.
He'll be disciplined, sir.
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.
  I want him fired.   There will be a full investigation,
and we'll take the necessary action.
Steve never would've let this happen.
Is he better yet?
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.
He did, but they found more.
His pancreas, stage four.
  Jesus.   Oh, my God. That's awful.
How much longer does he have?
Not long. A few weeks.
At least that's what his wife told me.
We have to go see him. Can you get the information where he is?
Of course. I'll make sure you get it right away.
  Thank you, Captain.   Thank you.
You're welcome. Good night.
  Front door.   Yes, sir.
Your weapon.
Your badge too.
Am I suspended, sir?
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?
Sir, I realize that  
Do you know how this reflects on me?
That one of our men could be so careless?
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee...
You could've killed a bystander.
That slug was found in somebody's front stoop.
What if it went in their house?
Your badge, Meechum.
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.
I was sick of working for other people,
and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.
So I said, "Fuck it. I'll do it my way."
  Then you just quit?   Not like you did.
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?
Probably. And then who knows?
Whatever the next adventure is. Maybe Shanghai.
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?
What about you? What's your big plan?
Uh, I don't know yet.
Come on. Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.
  You know what? I should take this.   Go. Do your thing.
Hey. You have proof Spinella was behind it?
Put it in context. Three weeks into a national teachers' strike  
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on  
There you go. Now post that
hack.
When do I see you next?
I'm background on this. I'm not your source.
You can't talk now?
  No.   When?
Soon, with bells on.
What about "More school books, less bricks"?
Nah, it's too broad. We need a better sound bite.
Something specific,
something that points the finger directly at Spinella.
  He'll deny any involvement.   Of course he will.
So how do we get around that?
We say he can't control his troops.
  There's no evidence it was a teacher.   Who else could it be?
He's gonna shift blame for the strike back on congress.
No. We need something clear, something clean,
something that sticks in your head.
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."
No. You're not hearing me. People like teachers.
No. We need something that makes Spinella the villain.
  His lack of control, his inability     Disorganized labor.
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.
When you've got angry teachers
throwing bricks through congressmen's windows,
you've gotta blame the union leadership.
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella
to keep his people in line.
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not,
he might wanna tone down the rhetoric
before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.
No one can prove anything. So that's the most cogent response.
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.
It's congress that should take responsibility.
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.
  She's right.   It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.
No. This story is getting traction.
Support for the strike is dipping.
So is the president's approval ratings.
But he gets to say in the
oval office another three years, no matter what.
We can't afford another three weeks.
When I told the unions to strike,
I told them to prepare for the long haul, all right?
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.
We figure it out.
I am not going to blink over something like this.
Fine. But if we lose the public relations battle,
none of that does us any good.
Frank wants us on the defensive.
I think this story is going to blow over.
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.
But I wanna give it another day or two first. Okay?
Hi, Adam.
You all right? I saw the news.
Yes, I'm fine.
That's gotta rattle the nerves  
a brick coming through the window.
It did, some.
So are you staying in the house?
We've got extra security now, so...
Well, um, it made me think of you,
so I figured I'd just check in.
I appreciate that.
We still haven't talked, have we?
  There's no need to.   I think we should.
Here's how I see it.
You asked me to come down. I did.
We both had ideas about what that could mean.
Probably very similar ideas.
But then you changed your mind.
So be it.
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.
So I won't call again.
  Done.   I'm not saying that.
What are you saying?
I just called because I care about you.
No agenda.
If you wanna talk again, call me.
If not, I understand. It's up to you.
You think I'm being unreasonable?
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do,
and I'm not gonna question it.
It was sweet of you to call.
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.
I know I do. I should go.
Yeah. Okay.
  Take care.   Okay.
  Frank, you got a minute?   I'll see you inside.
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.
  Am I still on the short list?   You are.
I haven't had a drink in over a month. I'm clean.
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.
But running for governor of a major state is a whole other ball game.
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to congress
'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.
All right. I'll tell you what.
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.
Give me a few days. I'll get back to you.
  Of course.   And, Peter...
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.
Janet.
  Is this a bad time?   No.
No, not at all.
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were coming.
Here. Take my chair.
  Oh, no. I'm fine.   I'll take these.
Thank you.
Hello, Steve.
These could use some water. I'll be right back.
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.
I didn't want too many people knowing.
Yes.
Francis wishes he could be here.
He wants you to know he's praying for you.
Couldn't make it, huh?
No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now,
and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.
I get it. I saw on the news.
  The brick.   Right.
I told Francis that
probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.
No. Probably not.
I never seen him pray.
Not in eight years.
You said he was praying for me.
You've seen us in church.
Yeah, but...
I never went inside.
They're just gorgeous.
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.
Please, call me Claire.
  I know you got things to do.   Of course.
If you need anything at all, call me. You have my cell.
Anything at all. And I'm sorry to have surprised you.
No. It was so nice of you to come.
Thank you. I know Steve appreciated it.
Check this out.
It's foam.
How many of these we have?
Get more.
Bring it on!
You need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.
We can't back away from this, Marty.
  We've gotta face it head-on.   They provoked us.
They were throwing foam. Our guys were throwing punches.
We're gonna come off the bad guys here.
Okay. Okay. I get it. I get it.
But I wanna be smart about this.
I wanna do something definitive that'll put this to bed
  and get us back on message.   CNN,
one on one, you and Underwood.
Frank is excellent in debates.
Go strong against him. Address the brick right to his face.
  End of story.   Underwood says he's in if you are.
Okay. But I want as much prep as possible, okay?
I want to run questions.
You moderate, you play Underwood.
Wear this one.
Then come in here. I wanna put powder on you.
Well, somebody at the studio can do that.
Yes, and they always cake on too much. I'm doing it.
War paint.
How bloody do you think it'll be?
Oh, I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.
Oh, you remember Peter Russo?
He's doing well. He hasn't had a drink in a month.
Oh, good for him. I like him.
Oh, good, because he could use your help.
  How?   We're running him for Governor.
Ambitious.
We wanna create jobs in his district.
It's on the Delaware River.
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.
Something with an economic upside.
This has to do with the shipyard closing?
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.
You think you might be able to draft a bill
that he can sponsor?
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.
Not domestic legislation.
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.
Does Catherine Durant still owe us?
When you make someone Secretary of State,
they owe you for life.
We're having trouble getting our water filters through Sudanese customs.
  I'll call from the car.   Tomorrow's fine.
  I would have done that anyway.   I know.
I'm ready for battle.
You wanna come watch?
  No. You go on ahead.   Oh, come on.
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.
It'll be fun.
Marty.
Frank.
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?
Yes, I would.
Two billion dollars of taxpayer's money being wasted.
And congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.
Oh, what? Did congress force the teachers to go on strike, Marty?
  No, we didn't.   Really, Frank?
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union,
when you threaten their job security,
you threaten their livelihood,
of course you force them to strike.
And did we also force them
to start throwing bricks at people's houses?
You know what? I'm really glad you brought that up,
because you know there's absolutely no proof
that that incident had anything to do with this strike.
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly
that we categorically condemn
any use of violence whatsoever or intimidation.
What you're saying essentially
is that you can't control your own people.
That is not what I'm saying.
That is what you're saying. You're disorganized.
Disorganized labor.
You can keep trotting out that phrase all you like,
but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children
and the fact that congress is not living up to their commitment.
Well, you know what I would like?
What?
An apology.
If not to me, then to my wife.
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.
She's standing right over there.
  Claire?   We need camera two on the wife.
Now, why don't you look her in the eye
and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick?
  Are you serious?   Yes.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,
I am sincerely sorry
that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.
And it actually sickens me
that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge,
none of our people had anything to do with it.
But you know what sickens me more?
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop
on national television to try and win a debate.
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.
And when you're done apologizing,
can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?
No. You've got this wrong, Marty.
There is no "You" And "I" in education.
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters
"U" and "I" are in the word "Education."
But "Education" with a capital E...
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
Yes, you do, Marty.
U and I   Education.
So, what, we're gonna waste the
rest of this debate naming all the vowels in  
I'm happy to play the vowel game.
You wanna play the vowel game with me?
All right. U think I O
U A apology.
But no, no, no.
U o I...
Interesting. You left out E for "Education."
  So let     Defecation  
Edification. I'm sorry. LOL.
You like sesame street so much?
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?
What I'm trying to say about education...
Well,
I guess school's still in session.
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.
Let's move on. Please.
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.
I had no intention of bringing you into this.
It wasn't part of a plan. I would've told you if it was.
I know.
The idea just struck me, and I went with it.
I don't mind that you improvised.
I just wish you'd done it better.
Congressman Frank Underwood says
he got, quote, "Schooled" by AFT spokesman
and chief strategist, Martin Spinella,
during a debate last night on this network.
In the past  hours,
reruns of the gaffe have played non-stop
on TV news programs and the Internet.
A YouTube clip set to techno music
has logged more than , hits
and spawned dozens of other spoofs.
No
No
E O I
with a capital "E"
education LOL
That was as clumsy
as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.
What was he thinking?
Just give me one second.
There's a deli. Down the street.
Patti, thanks for coming.
Sit down. You want some coffee?
No, thanks. I'm good.
Hey, did you see Bill Maher last night?
No, I didn't.
Oh, it was about the CNN thing.
I have to admit, Frank, it was kinda funny.
Well, I'll have to catch a rerun.
How you doing? You holding up all right with the strike?
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.
I have your candidate.
Peter Russo. First Congressional District.
We crossed him off.
I know. It's a mistake.
He's young, he's handsome. He's bright.
Nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia.
There's no donor base, no infrastructure.
You start me off with funding from the DNC
and I'll raise an army around this guy.
I will personally oversee his campaign.
Is that the best we can do?
What's better than a blank slate in the right hands?
Ed, you need to go.
Congressman, do you have a moment?
Thank you, Patti.
  Have him call me.   I will.
Ed? Please.
  What is going on?   I'm taking care of it.
One second, sir. Please.
All right. Make it fast, Meechum.
It's not easy for me to ask this,
but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.
A good word?
They're going to discharge me, sir.
I messed up. I'm fully aware.
But my job, it means everything to me,
and I know a good word from you would...
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum,
but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs.
There's protocols and rules.
Sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff  
There is nothing that I can do.
If anyone can convince the captain,
it would be you, Congressman.
I'm sorry. I wish you all the best, Meechum.
Doug.
What did Barney Hull say?
That we'd be the first to know.
I can't believe there hasn't been a single  call.
There's been plenty.
It's just not the sort we're after.
We got that kid in Atlanta.
No, it's got to be here. I can't be getting on a plane.
It looks too opportunistic.
Maybe if we open it up a little bit.
No, we cannot lower our standards.
We just have to be patient.
New rule   now that the debate's over,
Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?
I haven't seen something just lay there like that
since, uh...
I gotta go all the way back to my prom night.
Can we just settle this strike please?
Teachers have been out of the classroom for so long,
middle schoolers are starting to have sex with each other.
Enough.
I don't know why you had it on in the first place.
I love you, Francis.
I know.
We should say that more often to each other.
I need to clear my head.
...north and east of the airport.
I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.
Peter, let's talk.
So. I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.
You'll be getting four
million in start-up funding from the DNC.
I'll pick the team. You announce in August.
But the campaign starts today.
Are you ready?
I've already put together a platform.
It's mostly broad strokes, but we can hone it.
Good. The first thing we need to address
is your sobriety.
Oh, you don't need to worry about that.
Have you been going to meetings?
You mean AA?
  Yes.   That's not really my thing.
If you want my help,
then going to meetings is my one requirement.
I know I had a problem, Frank.
I accept that.
And I've taken responsibility for that,
but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.
You cannot white-knuckle your recovery, Peter.
This campaign will be the hardest thing
you've ever done in your life.
I realize that. I'm prepared for that.
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.
The party's investing in you.
I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.
All right. I'll do whatever I have to do.
Good. You'll start tomorrow morning.
  Doug will take you.   Stamper?
He's been sober  years.
Doug has a drinking problem?
Had. Not anymore. He'll be your sponsor.
In the meantime, I want you to meet with my wife, Claire.
She runs the Clean Water Initiative.
She's expecting you,
so clear your schedule and head over there now.
Frank.
Thank you.
For believing in me.
You're gonna make a great candidate, Peter.
The shipyard closing frees up , acres of federal land.
Our goal is to pass a watershed act for the Delaware River.
We develop the land in an environmentally-responsible way,
creating jobs in the process.
  How many jobs?   Thousands.
We're aiming for the   million mark.
We got a lot of work to do.
We do, but you can start
with the congressman whose districts fall within the watershed.
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.
Gillian will be the point person on our end.
I don't have any legislation experience.
  I'll help you.   When do we start?
We just did.
Will you introduce him to the research team?
  I'll be there in one second.   Sure.
Mr. President?
I want it over.
As soon as possible.
Gut the bill, Frank.
Do whatever's necessary to end this.
Mr. President, if we give in now,
the public won't credit you with a victory.
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.
Well, that's on you, Frank.
You let this situation devolve to where it is.
I've already been blamed
for the largest teacher's strike in US history.
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.
Not anyone else's.
How? By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.
I would ask that you continue to do so.
Whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working,
so I'm stepping in.
Gut the bill. Like Linda said.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?
Respectfully, sir,
you're allowing fear to cloud yours.
Not an easy thing to say no to the most powerful man
in the free world.
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect
is to defy him.
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?
Your meeting with the...
Thank you, Mr. President.
  Do you have my briefing?   Right here.
Good. Let's look it over.
Hi. How'd it go with Peter?
It went well.
Is he game?
Completely.
Ugh. Thank you.
That's a big weight off my shoulders.
You sound tired.
Tired. Impatient.
What can I do?
Nothing. This one's up to fate.
I don't like when we leave things to fate.
Neither do I.
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?
Probably.
Can't Doug man the fort?
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.
Call me if you want company.
I will. Good night.
Good night.
You should go home. I can take it from here.
Vigilance. It's good for the soul.
What's that?
Disorderly conduct.
Do you believe in karma?
Absolutely not.
Well, I do.
At least tonight.
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.
Let's do something about Meechum.
What?
Get him his job back.
He fired his weapon.
He overreacted.
Cardiff. On the phone. Now.
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.
It requires very little of me
and will mean the world to him.
It's a very inexpensive investment.
Hello, sir. This is Doug Stamper.
I have Francis Underwood for you.
I got him on.
Captain, I know it's late,
but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Are you hungry?
You have any trouble getting in?
Nah, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice.
So I hope it didn't overcook it.
Frank, you always pay too much. This is way too much.
For the inconvenience.
You know,  years you been coming to my joint.
This the first time I been to yours.
What do you think?
I could get used to it.
Well, you're welcome any time.
Thank you, Freddy.
Always, Frank.
Got a...  rd Street...
That's a drive-by shooting.
Get details.
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the Captain.
He told me you called,
and I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.
From this moment on, you are a rock.
You absorb nothing, you say nothing,
and nothing breaks you.
  Is that clear?   Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Steve?
I'll leave you be.
Where, uh   where's Janet?
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.
I told her go home, get some rest.
Well, is everything okay?
Your text said it was important.
I don't know how to put this.
The thing is, I...
I've been thinking...
a lot.
About my life.
About the things I haven't done.
Things I haven't said.
I hate your husband.
A lot of people do.
The past eight years, I watched over him.
But it wasn't him I was watching.
And every time I saw you,
every time I heard your voice,
all I could think to myself was,
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?
I remember his exact words.
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness,
Say no.
I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids
and count the days until retirement.
I promise you freedom from that.
I promise you'll never be bored."
You know, he was the only man  
and there were a lot of others who proposed.
But he was the only one who understood me.
He didn't put me on some pedestal.
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.
Because he knew I'd say yes.
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
Is this what you wanted?
Is that the way you wanted it?
Stop. Stop.
Please. Please. Stop.
Don't.
You told me your truth.
Now you know mine.
Hey, it's Peter.
I don't expect you to call me back,
but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking last night,
and I went to my first AA meeting this morning.
Um, I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.
But I guess the real reason I called you
is just to say I love you and I miss you.
I hope you're well.
This is work, not play.
Then why'd you bother coming over?
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.
That would be play.
That would be work with a view.
Sorry to disappoint.
How many characters in a tweet?
Type this, let me know where you land.
"Eight-year-old Washington DC boy
killed by a stray bullet in gangland shoot-out."
"Should have been in school"?
"Spinella to blame?"
Press "Send."
Now give me a name, details.
Tyler Davis. Third grader at Vernon Baker Elementary.
Shot outside his home in southeast just before noon today.
Sent. Where are you going?
  To see the mother.   You don't wanna...?
There's work to do. I'll see you later tonight.
Tyler never did anything wrong.
He was a good boy.
Everybody loved him.
It's okay.
If Tyler's school had been in session,
this senseless killing would have never taken place.
We need to end this strike now
and get all our children back in school where they belong
before we risk another death like this.
So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed to the capitol right now,
and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk
so that we can end this pointless strike.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's go back inside.
Mr. Spinella, one question...
Mr. Spinella is not to make a comment at this time.
No comment. No comment.
Thank you.
Frank.
So?
You said you wanted to talk.
You said you wanted to work out a compromise.
I lied.
Excuse me?
I have no intention of working out a compromise.
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?
What the hell's the matter with you?
You think this is some kind of a game?
No.
These are real people with families to feed.
Would you please stop that?
Stop what?
In five seconds, I'm out of here.
One. Two. Three.
  Four.   Goodbye, Frank.
You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
What?
I'm a white-trash cracker from a
white-trash town that no one would even bother to piss on.
But here's the difference  
I've made something of myself.
I have the keys to the capitol. People respect me.
But you, you're still nothing.
You're just an uppity dago
in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions.
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.
They're dying. And no one respects you.
The most you'll ever make of yourself
is blowing men like me.
Men with real power.
Yes. I can smell the cock on your breath from here.
You think you can get under my skin?
I know I can.
Kiss my ass, Frank.
You can't afford to walk out.
Watch me.
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.
What do you have?
I have  million honorable teachers.
Fair enough. But I got something even better.
Go ahead. Open it.
Okay.
I'll play your game.
You're an idiot.
Stamper threw it.
You're full of shit.
Oh, no, Stamper threw the brick.
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.
Are you kidding me?
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.
You would do something that low, Frank?
I arranged the brick, Marty,
just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.
Back off, Frank.
Why don't you just get down on your knees where you really belong?
Back off, Frank.
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me
  is come on your     Fuck you!
Everything okay in there?
Look, I'll   I'll tell them you provoked me.
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.
And who's going to believe you?
You just assaulted a United States congressman,
which is a felony.
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.
Because the strike ends now.
You think it'll leave a scar?
I have a thick skin.
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee,
will you please make sure no guns go off?
I'll do my best.
I saw Steve again today.
How is he?
In a lot of pain.
Should I go see him?
I don't think you need to.
Zoe Barnes.
When he dies, we'll pay for his funeral.
You don't need to take it?
No. I'm done with work today.House.of.Cards.SE
Set them up over here.
Vice President Matthews.
  Bob.   Mr. Vice President.
  Mr. Vice President.   Frank.
Sir, I'm gonna need you to stand on your mark.
I'm fine right here.
Two minutes, people.
So they pull me from the car.
Both legs broken, fractured skull,
punctured lung.
My heart stops. Two full minutes.
They're pumping my chest. Nothing.
They grab the defibrillators. Pachoom!
Nothing.
Third time, the pistons start firing.
Doctors tell me it's a miracle I'm alive.
But, seriously, you talk about a wake-up call from God.
You don't get to come back from the dead twice.
The President of the United States.
Good morning.
"The education reform and achievement act
that I sign into law today
will affect every child and parent in the United States,
will ensure a better educated workforce for decades to come,
and will reinforce America's
preeminence as an intellectual superpower.
And I'd like to thank one man in particular
who never lost sight of the larger mission,
who spearheaded this bill from the beginning,
and that's congressman Frank Underwood."
Invited guests, please join us in the east room for refreshments.
Media, we will
convene immediately in the briefing room for our conference.
Linda, thank you so much for all the help you gave us
in getting this bill passed.
No, thank you, Frank.
This was your baby from the beginning.
I appreciate you standing your ground on this one, Frank.
I'm smart enough to admit when I was wrong.
I was just telling Frank we should set up a weekly
so he can keep us up to date on what's going on in the house.
That sounds like a great idea.
Congratulations, sir.
Garrett, I was wondering if we could talk for a few minutes.
That thing I mentioned a couple of weeks ago
about the jobs tax credit...
I've been giving it a lot of thought, Jim,
and I think it's a good idea.
But I'd like to look over my notes first, if you don't mind,
so I can talk about it intelligently with you.
Sir, you have your call with the Prime Minister.
Busy man.
Yes, he is.
Frank, I hear that you are heading up
the special election in my home state.
  Peter Russo.   We're trying to keep that
under the radar until he officially announces.
In fact, we're not even working
out of my office until that happens.
  Where are you working from?   The basement of my house.
Any reason why the D.N.C.
didn't ask my advice on the candidate?
Well, I thought they passed it by you, or Linda did.
  Nobody did.   Well, that is unacceptable.
And I have major doubts about Russo.
  His inexperience?   Yes, and he's urban-based.
I don't know if he'll connect with rural voters.
Look, frankly, that's one of my concerns as well.
We're working on that.
But if you were to come out and stump with him,
that would go a long way to convince...
Frank, I can't stump for somebody I don't believe in.
It's early days yet. I'd ask you to keep an open mind.
And let me know if you want me
to set up a meeting between the two of you,
because, sir, an endorsement from you
would be a big coup for him.
It's good to see you, Mr. Vice President.
Frank.
Congressman Underwood?
Miss Barnes, I was under the impression
you didn't wanna cover the White House.
Slugline just got access yesterday.
  I know.   I left the Herald
because I didn't wanna cover the White House,
and now here I am.
Access isn't the same as a ball and chain.
Am I only gonna see you at bill signings now?
I haven't heard from you in three weeks.
Insecurity bores me.
I feel the same way about condescension.
Your place, this evening,
and I'll text you when I'm about to arrive.
What if I'm busy?
You're just afraid I'm gonna stand you up again.
I just wanna make sure it's worth my while.
It'll be worth your while.
This'll make up for last time.
It's a piece of history.
From the President's hand to yours.
You believe in all that higher-power stuff they talk about in the room?
I believe there are things beyond our control.
Who or what's controlling them... that I don't know.
I don't believe in God.
Heaven, hell. None of it.
  Too much catholic school?   Maybe.
I'm not saying you have to believe in God, Peter,
or anything, for that matter.
But you shouldn't rule anything out.
I should go.
It's on the campaign.
Our crosstabs show   of likely voters
are willing to consider a recovering alcoholic.
Now, those numbers dip a little when you introduce cocaine,
but not by much.
Randy?
It's a risk, but it'll make waves.
Free coverage across the board.
The narrative has to be redemption.
A Phoenix from the ashes.
Well, let's not focus on the ashes.
We don't want people to think Peter was a disaster.
No, no. We focus on the positive.
A "Fresh start" And a "Clean start"
both did well in focus groups.
"Clean start" sounds too much like "Clean slate."
  I like "Fresh start."   Yeah, I do too.
How we doing on the fund-raising?
The alcoholic thing will turn off some of the in-state donors,
but it's an off-year election.
We can hit up the usual suspects in New York and California.
Walter, how vulnerable are we?
I'm not prepared to answer that question.
Peter and I have yet to perform the holy sacrament of confession.
We still need to address the shipyard closing too.
Claire's helping us with that.
We are pushing a bill
called the Delaware river watershed Act,
and I think it's going to bring about
We have a draft of the bill completed.
Peter's in the process of securing cosponsors.
And who have you called, by the way?
I have some e-mails out,
but most of them wanna see a bill first.
Have you set up a meeting with the shipbuilders yet?
I don't think they're gonna back me.
That's the entire point of the bill, Peter.
Well, if I go to them and I say,
"Hey, some of you maybe will get your jobs back,
"Not tomorrow, but three years from now,
and most of you won't be getting your jobs back anyway... "
All right, let's put a pin in this until we get more sponsors.
I have to go to the office. I'll catch you all later.
Okay, let's move on to our field plan.
I want to go through the regions one by one...
Francis.
We spent six weeks on that bill.
It'll be fine. He'll come around.
I'll see you later tonight?
I have an appointment.
So I won't see you until morning.
I'll be back before you get up.
I appreciate your taking the time today, sir.
Did you get that tax credit memo
the economic research team put together?
You didn't ask me here to talk about memos.
I know small talk when I hear it, Linda.
The President has asked
that you take a step back from Pennsylvania.
You've been taking a lot of trips there,
meeting with legislators...
It's my home state. There's a jobs crisis.
We can't afford to play favorites.
The message is  states, one solution 
not one state,  solutions.
I never expected to be involved in every policy or decision,
but I have been completely cut out of everything.
We value your input, Mr. Vice President,
but right now, we can't...
Don't condescend, Linda.
No one even asked me who I thought should fill my seat.
Why is Frank Underwood leading the charge on that, not me?
That is a D.N.C. issue.
We are staying out of it and so should you.
And so I'm supposed to just cut ribbons and go to funerals?
You knew what you signed up for.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
I didn't get my pen.
  Your pen?   From the bill signing.
Oh, we'll see what we can do about that.
I can see your security guy.
Meechum?
He's cute.
He'd never go for you.
Why not?
You're too intimidating.
He's the one with the gun.
But you're the one with the congressman.
We'll talk after.
We'll talk before.
Peter Russo.
Pennsylvania's first district.
He's gonna run for governor.
Fill Matthews' seat.
It's an exclusive profile.
With someone no one's ever heard of.
What's the angle?
Alcohol, drugs.
He's a kid from the streets.
I want the profile to come out as soon as he announces,
and I'd like it to be kind.
I don't write puff pieces.
Then get someone else to write it.
I thought you had something for me.
It's too easy for people to link me as your source.
It's dangerous.
I don't benefit from handing out headlines to other people.
Generosity is its own form of power, Zoe.
Step six.
Step seven.
You always wear sunglasses at night?
How did you find me?
I figured you had to be in government.
I kept googling till I found your picture.
This won't work, what you're doing.
It was a one-time deal.
You don't get to keep coming back for more.
I'll go to the police.
They'll laugh in your face. Look at you.
If the police won't listen to me,
I'll call TV stations.
I know the names...
Douglas Stamper, Peter Russo,
Frank Underwood.
You are walking down a road you do not want to walk down.
Please, I won't call anyone.
But I need your help.
I don't have anywhere to go. I don't have anyone I can call.
I've had to do things. And I don't wanna do it anymore.
That's all I've got right now.
Find a place to stay and let me know where you are.
I'll figure something out.
You hungry?
What's your name?
Sapphire.
No. What's your name?
Rachel.
Your ex-wife... anything uncouth?
How do you mean?
Bondage, orgies, water sports?
  No. Definitely not.   Narcotics?
  She wasn't into that.   Not even a little ganga?
Okay. Once in a blue moon.
Ever with your children?
  God, no!   Ever in front of them?
Look, I'm not the world's best dad,
but I would never do that.
Fine. Let's move on to prostitution.
How long is this gonna take?
Until there's nothing I don't know about you.
I wrote all this down.
I've been doing this a long time, congressman.
I know when I've scraped all the shit off the shoe.
Prostitution.
After my divorce, I took a trip to Thailand.
It was about two weeks.
How many women?
Ten. Fifteen.
I... I don't know. It was a bit of a blur.
There were drugs?
Uh, yes.
Opium, speed,
some smack.
  Powder or needles?   Both.
Would any of these women know who you are?
No. None of them spoke English.
And I never mentioned I was a congressman.
Have you mainlined heroin back here in the States?
  Just once.   Any scars on your arm?
No. I was mainly into cocaine.
What about prostitutes here in D.C.?
How often?
  I fucked around a bit, okay?   Details, please.
Do you get off on this or something?
Does a doctor enjoy it when he cups your balls
and asks you to cough?
You wanna know how many times I came?
I honestly don't care whether you win.
But if you do, work with me.
How often did you solicit prostitutes in D.C.?
Once every two or three months.
Sometimes more frequently, sometimes less.
Do you have reason to believe any of them were underage?
Jesus! No. Look, they were mostly high-end.
That doesn't mean they were .
I need a fucking break!
What's going on?
He's an amateur, Frank.
If I can get under his skin in less than an hour,
how do you think he'll hold up under the press?
It'll be a Turkey shoot.
All right. I'll speak to him.
Frank, it's just... it's not gonna work.
I'm gonna get crucified.
You'll be fine. We've got a crack team behind you.
It doesn't matter how good the team is.
I mean with my past? Come on.
From the very beginning, I said this was the plan.
  You agreed to it.   I didn't think it through.
We have to tackle this head-on,
or the G.O.P. will crucify you.
We have to steal their ammunition from them.
Honesty is your best defense and offense.
I'm the one that has to get in front of these cameras and say this shit.
They don't have to say it. I do.
  Peter...   I wanna be governor. I do.
But not this way. I just can't do it.
If you weren't unsure now,
there'd be something wrong with you.
I expected this.
Not easy... what we're asking you to do.
It's okay to vacillate a little.
I'm not trying to throw a wrench in the works.
I know you're not. I'll tell you what.
You take the rest of the day off.
You go back to your office,
you catch up with whatever you have to catch up on,
you get a good night's sleep, you go to a meeting tomorrow,
and then you come here and we'll talk the whole thing through.
Can you give me at least that?
Yeah. Okay, Frank.
Good.
What's going on with all the little sculptures?
I found a flower on the dining room table
and a bird on the nightstand a few days ago.
It's a swan.
You made them?
Yes.
A new hobby?
No.
It's an interest.
May I bring up something else I've noticed?
What's that?
You...
standing in front of the refrigerator.
Is there a reason you haven't talked to me about it?
I haven't felt the need to.
Is it bad?
It's not pleasant.
But, no, it's not bad.
What can I do?
Nothing.
If there was something, I'd ask.
Did you think it was weird that I called you?
Totally weird.
Except for the fact that I was planning on calling you.
Really? Why?
I was a real grade-A bitch to you at the Herald,
and I almost apologized when I saw you at the White House,
but I chickened out.
So, anyway, I am drunk enough, and I am sorry.
Why did you call me?
I was just wondering how
things were going at the old stomping ground.
  Here you go.   Thank you.
It's just not the same since tom left.
And I don't blame you for doing what you did.
But this new guy?
Six years running E.W. Online
does not a managing editor make.
Would you ever wanna come work with us?
I mean, it'd be a huge fucking deal.
Chief political correspondent of the Herald
moves to Slugline?
Did carly heath put you up to this?
No. Not at all.
But if you want, I can talk to her.
You think she would go for it?
Honestly, I don't know.
She's got this sort of anti-establishment "fuck you" attitude.
Conventional news bores her.
But if you had something gritty to show...
I've got a story if you want it.
It's pretty fucking great.
You would give away a story?
If you're not interested...
no, I'm interested.
If I seem a little hung over, it is because I am.
A lot hung over, actually.
God, I almost had a couple of months,
and then last night, I...
Well, I don't remember much, so...
But anyway, here I am.
Keep coming back.
It works if you work it.
Thank you for sharing, Diane.
I'm Doug, and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Doug.
One of the things I do for a living is count.
I count votes.
Yeas, nays, neutrals, abstaining.
And I'm good at it.
But the most important count I do has nothing to do with work.
It's the number of days since April , .
As of this morning, that's ,.
The bigger that number gets, the more it frightens me,
because I know all it takes is one drink to go back to zero.
Most people see fear as a weakness.
It can be.
Sometimes for my job, I have to put fear in other people.
I know that's not right.
But if I'm honest, like the fourth step asks us to be,,
I have to be ruthless, because failure is not an option.
The same goes for my sobriety.
I have to be ruthless with myself.
I have to use my fear.
It makes me stronger.
Like everyone in this room, I can't control who I am.
But I can control the zero.
Fuck the zero.
Thanks for sharing.
It works if you work it.
Who would like to share next?
  Was he at the meeting?   He was.
I tried to find him afterwards,
but he was gone before I could catch up with him.
  Did he say anything?   No.
He never shares. He looked preoccupied.
  You think he'll show up at the house today?   I have no idea.
He's not answering my calls.
Mine neither. Anything else I need to know?
I hear silence. I don't like that sound.
Something came up. I'm handling it.
  Something serious?   Serious but solvable.
Do I wanna know more?
I don't think you do. We'll be okay.
I might have to involve Nancy. I'm hoping I won't have to.
But if I do, she'll have no knowledge of anything damaging.
All right. Use your best judgment.
Of course, sir.
I've gotta go.
Miss Gallagher?
Can the congressman have a moment?
Things are... they're complicated.
I realize that, but he truly needs you.
I don't know what I could say to him.
I think just showing up would do him a world of good.
Today is tough. The speaker has a full schedule...
Look, I already spoke to Bob,
and he said he'd be fine if you took the rest of the day off.
In fact, he said he'd be fine if you wanted to take
  the next six months off.   What?
I want you to be deputy campaign manager.
You work under Nash Aarons.
No. I spent years being Peter's crutch.
If you just want me there...
Well, of course we want you there to help, but not as a crutch.
Peter is a talented young man with a lot of potential.
He knows this, but he needs to hear it from someone other than me.
Someone he truly cares about.
I'm sorry. This is just a lot right now.
Well, you don't have to make a decision now,
but at least talk to Peter.
I mean, there's no harm in that, now, is there?
Ten grand.
We divert it from your campaign accounts.
  We itemize it so it looks like...   Wait.
You want me to pay for this?
Use Frank's reelection fund.
Commissioner, the majority of the money that you've raised
has come from people we've sent your way.
And you sent them because
I sprung your boy Russo in the first place.
We're even. I don't owe you shit.
There's a girl in trouble. Let's help her out.
  Not my problem.   It could be.
We put her back on the streets,
there's no telling what she could do.
I'm a hell of a lot more afraid
of the U.S. attorney than I am of some hooker.
This is a very inexpensive insurance policy.
I already broke the law once, Doug.
There's no fucking way I'm gonna mess with campaign finance regulations.
I don't even wanna be hearing this shit.
,
followed by a luncheon for the national board
of directors for the girl scouts of America.
  Mr. President.   Jim.
After that, you've got a meet and greet with the finalist...
I'll catch up with you in a minute.
This way, sir.
What are you doing here?
The congressman wanted me to come over.
  Why?   He wants me to work for your campaign.
  Deputy Manager.   Frank!
He said you're having some doubts.
I was just about to tell him that I decided not to run.
Okay. Um, if you've made up your mind,
then I should probably get going.
Did he tell you about the whole plan?
About coming clean?
Yeah, he did.
I have Kevin and Sarah to think about.
  Everyone has a past.   Not like mine.
You don't know half the things I've done, Christina.
My kids read. Their friends read.
I can't take that chance.
Look, if you don't wanna run, then you shouldn't.
I do wanna run.
I wouldn't have let it go this far if I didn't want it.
Then maybe it's a good thing...
confronting your past, even for your kids.
They're a lot stronger than you give them credit for.
Look, if Underwood, if the D.N.C.,
if they all think you can do it, then...
I don't care what they think. I care what you think.
I think you'd be great.
  So, she really wants this?   That's the impression I got.
What about ego? I don't need to be dealing with a diva.
She's not a diva, she's an award-winning journalist
with  years' experience.
You told me she treated you like shit.
There was some friction.
So why are you going to bat for her?
Don't we want to work with the best people?
Plus, it'd be big for the site.
The Herald's senior political writer?
Sure, but she's so old guard.
Everything's by the book.
There's no bite to it.
She told me about a profile she's working on.
  It's got serious bite.   What is it?
She can tell you herself. You should talk to her.
Here's the deal.
My children stay out of the limelight.
No photo ops, no press.
We wouldn't dream of it.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Sit down.
  Where you from?   Outside of Lynchburg.
  Virginia?   Yeah.
  Are your parents still living there?   No. I can't.
If I find a place for you to stay for a while,
can I count on you to be smart?
  What kind of place?   A nice place.
A safe place until we can figure out something permanent.
But I need to know that you won't pull anything like this again.
Promise me.
I promise.
Look at me when you say it.
I promise you.
How you doing on money?
I don't have enough for tomorrow.
What are you doing?
I thought you wanted me to...
You said you were done with that.
I'll be in touch.
If you own up to some of the shenanigans,
sweep the rest under the rug, you might have a shot.
How much do we have to sweep under?
Well, the kid had a talent for covering his tracks.
I've highlighted all the items I think he should admit to.
The rest I wouldn't mention.
It's a lot not to talk about.
  I need your help with something.   Right now?
  Yes.   Is it important?
Because you told me I could leave early this weekend
to go visit my daughter down in Virginia.
You have a guest room in your house, right?
Well, it's Mary's old room, but, yes.
I need you to put someone up for a while. A young woman.
  What? Who?   Her name is Rachel.
I can't tell you anymore than that.
I don't understand. Why do you need...
No questions, Nancy. I just need you to do this for me.
I wouldn't be asking if it weren't serious.
Put up for how long?
I don't know. It could be a while.
I'm supposed to put up a complete stranger
and not ask any questions?
Nancy, please.
You're the only person I can trust.
Is something illegal going on?
No. She's just a girl in trouble
who needs a place to stay.
  We have to be discreet.   Can I at least meet her first?
I need to know now.
Okay, I guess.
Thank you.
There's no catch, Larry.
Your district gets over  million if the numbers hold.
And most of the money is earmarked for economic development,
not research.
That's great, but I need more than your support.
I need you to be a sponsor.
Fantastic, Larry.
Great. I'll put you down.
You too. Bye.
So that just leaves Clayburn... and Price?
With Jennings on the fence.
And I know Roger. I'll call him.
And I'll track down these other two over the weekend.
Really good work today, Peter.
Do you know where I put my purse?
It's right here.
Did you make those?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
Oh, this? I've been fooling around with it a little bit.
Can I see?
Sarah learned how to make these birds in her art class.
Then she taught it to Kevin, and they got obsessed,
and there were little pieces of paper all over the apartment.
Do you wanna take them for the kids?
Oh, no. I can't.
Oh, please. I'll just throw them out eventually.
Thank you. They'll love them.
So you should bring the kids by the house
sometime so I can meet them.
Kevin and Frank can play the video games.
He told you that?
I was a little surprised, I have to admit.
If anybody knew he came home every day to...
  it's embarrassing.   There's worse secrets to have.
Yeah, there are, I suppose.
I'll call you Monday after I talk
to Clayburn and Price.
Okay, great. Have a good weekend, Peter.
You too.
I had Linda talk to the Vice President.
  He'll keep his nose out of it.   I appreciate that.
He's a good man,
but this is a very delicate moment in the campaign.
You start spreading doubts, and...
He's a pain in the ass. We all know it.
You don't have to mince words, Frank.
I have to say, sir, the Vice President has a point.
I'm not   sold on Russo.
Do we really wanna go with someone this untested?
Frank?
We're grooming him, sir.
  When do you announce?   Next month.
  That's not enough time.   What do you see in him?
I was wondering the same thing. There's not that much to see.
What I see is a recovering alcoholic with a history of drug abuse.
  What?   Excuse me, Frank?
But he's clean now. Has been for a year.
This is a redemption story, Mr. President.
This is a bright young man who's put his life back on track.
Now he wants to help put Pennsylvania back on track.
Drugs, Frank?
People love an underdog, Linda,
and people love someone who stands up after they've fallen.
Combine those two, it's a very powerful narrative.
All of our polling indicates this is gonna work.
You want us to endorse someone with a history of substance abuse?
Let us get his story out there
and watch it connect with the voters.
All I care about is a win, Frank.
And I believe Russo is our best chance.
This is not a hail Mary, Mr. President,
  this is a well-thought-out game plan.   Mr. President...
I realize that I sometimes think out of the box,
but the last time I did,
we signed an education bill.
All right. We won't stand in your way.
But if it backfires, Frank...
I'll guide Peter every step along the way.
We will not disappoint you, Mr. President.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
Linda.
I didn't plan on telling him so much so soon,
but if I didn't, Linda would've swayed him.
There's no better way to overpower a trickle of doubt
than with a flood of naked truth.
This is why the education bill was so important.
It bought me influence precisely when I needed it most.
How long have you been drinking?
A long time. Since I was a kid.
How old were you when you had your first drink?
  Nine.   Nine years old?
Yeah. My dad gave me a beer for my ninth birthday.
When did you first start using drugs?
I won't go into too many specifics
other than to say I had a few minor brushes
with marijuana and cocaine in the past but not recently,
and only a handful of times.
No other drugs besides marijuana and cocaine?
No.
Under what circumstances?
Occasional social gatherings. That's the most I'll say.
Ever while you were in public office?
No. Never. My chief problem was alcohol.
And you've been sober how long now?
  A little over a year.   And what made you want to get sober?
Two things. My children,
whom I love more than anything else in the world,
and my renewed faith in God.
Zoe.
Lucas.
I was just in the neighborhood, and I thought...
No. That's a lie. I was at the bar around the corner.
The one with the, uh...
and I remembered that time
that I dropped you off after work.
I knew it was...
This block.
And I, uh, buzzed, and then I waited...
  you're wasted.   I'm pretty wasted.
Do you wanna know a deep, dark secret?
Now we don't work together...
anymore.
Lucas...
I'm really flattered.
But I'm just not in a place
where I'm even thinking romantically right now.
I'm sorry. I, uh...
Yeah.
You want me to pull up now, sir?
I still have my key.
I'll be in the kitchen if you need anything.
Thank you.
Hey, I got us wine, but I can't find a corkscrew anywhere.
Give it to me.
I need a pen.
  The pen the President gave you?   That'll work.
Did you talk to Ms. Skorsky?
I did. She said it was intense.
I think Carly's gonna offer her a job at Slugline.
  Was that your doing?   Janine expressed interest.
I took the next step.
Well done. Always good to be owed favors.
I was wondering. Do you ever think about my age?
No. Does my age bother you?
You must have other lovers... men that are younger than me.
  No.   Not that I would mind.
I am married, after all.
I don't have time for other lovers.
Mm. Shit.
It's turned. Give me that.
You could've just stepped on it.
I have asked the super to get an exterminator in here,
and he won't do it.
So anytime I see a cockroach or a spider, or whatever,
I try and trap it, and then I leave it by his door.
You really ought to get your parents to let you borrow some money.
Then you wouldn't have to live in the third world.
I would never take money from them.
Because they don't have it, or because you don't want it.
Because I don't want it.
It's father's day, you know.
It is?
You should call your father.
I'll call him tomorrow.
Tomorrow you'll be the daughter that forgot father's day
instead of the one who remembered.
Go ahead. Call him.
Hey, dad. Sorry it's so late.
'Cause you weren't home the last time I called her.
There's so little she'll ever reveal to me or I to her.
I bet her father knows even less.
I'm sure she's speaking half an octave higher.
Same voice she had when she was .
Telling him all about her new job,
how much she misses him,
and sorry she didn't send a card.
Telling him everything but the truth.
Just like she wouldn't tell me about that young man downstairs.
I'm calling now, all right?
Don't make me feel bad about it.
It was the best thing that could've happened.
I didn't fit in there.
I've been called worse, dad.
There's a value in having secrets.
Creatures like myself, like Claire, like Zoe...
we wouldn't be ourselves without them.
But Peter Russo, on the other hand...
he's trapped by his secrets.
What I'm trying to do is give him the opportunity to set himself free.
I don't know.
I don't know yet.
After all, we are nothing more or less
than what we choose to reveal.
What I am to Claire is not what I am to Zoe,
just as Zoe is not to me what she is to her father.
Probably Thanksgiving.
'Cause I don't think I can make it back before then.
Okay. I'll try.
I said I'll try.
For Christmas. Uh... no.
No. I'm not seeing anyone right now.
I don't feel like it.
Because I'm not interested in that.
I would tell you, dad.
Yeah.
Okay.
Don't be worried about me.
I'm fine.
Yeah.
Dad, I'm in...
I'm in a really great place right now.
I'm gonna try.
I'm gonna try to come, okay?
Happy Father's Day.
Aren't you gonna wish me a happy Father's Day?
You don't have any children.
Don't I?House.of.Cards.SE
Control stacked, energy-efficient.
Now, mind you, the whole
collection could probably fit on a Kindle,
but at least the cadets will have
another placeto get out of the rain.
Did you have any input on the design?
I approved the blueprints.
If something's gonna have my name on it,
I want to make damn sure they build it right.
I think my husband fancies himself a bit of an architect.
Well, Jefferson designed Monticello.
And he also fucked his slaves.
Luckily, I don't have any,
so that particular temptation hasn't presented itself.
The Sentinel...
South Carolina's premiere military college.
They taught me the values of honor, duty, and respect.
They also hazed me, tried to break me,
and, senior year, nearly expelled me
when I volunteered for a Senate Race and my studies suffered.
But that didn't stop them from soliciting a hefty sum
for their new library  years later.
How quickly poor grades
are forgotten in the shadow of power and wealth.
Your drink is only about half as full as it should be, Frank.
Are you trying to get me drunk?
Drunk, passed out in the gutter,
so I can steal your wife.
Did you get the email about the riflemen?
  What email?   From my office about the invitations.
I was hoping they would be here.
I'll check the list,
but I don't remember any email.
Oh, not a problem. I was just wondering.
Well, shit, Frank, I'm sorry.
Don't you sweat it for a second.
In fact, here's how you can make it up to me... freshen my drink.
That I can do.
Congratulations, Congressman.
Remy. Nice to see you here.
Gerry and all the folks at Sancorp give you their regards.
Well, I'm sorry they couldn't make it.
Where's Claire?
Oh, she's here somewhere, fending off admirers.
Sancorp was very disappointed she turned down their donation.
I can imagine.
And they're also concerned
about Peter Russo running for Governor.
Now, how do you know about that?
Three quarters of Pennsylvania
sits on top of the Marcellus Shale.
If I can't find out who's running for governor,
I don't deserve a dime of what they're paying me.
This watershed bill Russo sponsors
places a lot of restrictions on drilling.
Remy, congress is in recess,
and this weekend is not about work.
I apologize. You are absolutely right.
Is Sancorp your only account?
I have plenty.
But my other clients didn't pay for your library
or my plane ticket down here.
It's a nice little junket for you.
I do hope you're taking in the sights.
This isn't my first trip to Charleston.
But I'll bet it's your first time not as my press secretary.
It is.
Who else do you have coming in?
I didn't want to pack tonight too much.
You know, these receptions are usually just for the money people
like yourself.
Normally, this is where I would start to drone on
about the Sentinel's history, its philosophy,
its yadda, yadda, yadda.
But I'm going to save that for my big speech tomorrow,
and that way I'm not gonna bore y'all to tears twice.
Tonight we're going to turn it over
to a man who needs no introduction,
because we all know what a son of a bitch he is.
Seriously, though,
Frank Underwood exemplifies
all the virtues we try to instill in our graduates.
We're so proud to call you an alumnus, Frank,
and to have your name as a permanent fixture on our campus.
Congressman Frank Underwood!
Thank you, president Higgins.
I first want to thank Sancorp Industries
for providing the funds to make the library possible.
When I matriculated here as a young cadet,
Jimmy Carter had just been elected president.
After I graduated,
I wished that I could have had another four years,
just like Jimmy.
Well, neither of us got our wish.
But I left this campus with fond memories.
The first time I ever...
 Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton 
 Old times there are not forgotten 
 Look away, look away, look away 
I got your damn email.
 I wish I was in Dixie 
 Hooray, hooray 
 In dixieland, I'll take my stand 
 To live and die in Dixie 
 Away, away 
 Away, away 
 Away down South in Dixie 
 Away, away 
 Away down South in Dixie 
 From the halls of Montezuma 
 To the shores of Tripoli 
 We will fight our country's battles 
the honey child...
when she stepped out in the...
trying on the bra on housewives of Atlanta,
and I teased you about that,
and I said... I called it the honey child,
because she's the honey child now.
Anyway, here's the thing...
How long has that light been like that?
I don't know. A month, maybe.
And nobody's come to fix it?
Nobody don't fix nothing around here.
Well, have you asked?
Shh. I'm watching.
Leave it alone. I'm used to it now.
Better, huh?
Now it's too dark.
What did you do that for?
Listen, ma, I'm running for Governor.
I'm going to announce it in a few days.
That's why I came up to Philly.
There's a community meeting tomorrow.
I'm going to talk to the shipbuilders about a plan
to bring their jobs back
so they'll support me in the election.
I don't know nothing about that stuff.
It's over my head.
Okay, listen, there's going to be some stories
coming out about me in the news...
about my past.
I just wanted to give you a heads-up
so it doesn't catch you off guard.
I don't watch the news no more. A bunch of garbage.
You want to see some pictures of Kevin and Sarah?
Too dark to look at pictures.
No, no, no. It's on my phone. You don't need any...
Get it away from me. I hate those things.
Brain cancer.
I'm a crafter, and I have a hot glue gun,
and I can very well do this my...
It wasn't just up the stairs,
it was up three flights of stairs,
in the science building.
And Guckenheimer, what did he did...
"Well, you look lovely today, Mrs. Governor."
And the thing took a dump.
Right. And they couldn't get it back...
You can get a cow up three flights of stairs,
but you can't get it down.
And that's why Andy said...
"Who wants steak for dinner?"
  How are you boys doing?   We're good.
  You think I'm fat?   Take the Fifth.
Seriously, Phil, here, thinks I got fat with old age.
Ah, you're a big man with an even bigger heart.
There you go.
She said you're chubby.
Frank, I'm going to go back to the hotel.
Okay? Have fun.
  I love this woman.   Yeah, she...
Don't let him get into too much trouble.
They'll have grounds for impeachment
when we're done with him.
Better get another drink before they close up.
You're coming with me to help carry them.
You're gonna be a waiter tonight.
Lazy-ass cadet. Lazy-ass cadet.
Yeah, hold on a second there, partner.
You had no idea we were coming?
Complete surprise.
I thought Higgins might have...
No, he played it perfectly.
Made me think you weren't coming at all.
Are you kidding? We wouldn't have missed it for the world.
On the library, are they going to put "Frank" Or "Francis"?
Francis. It's the same as the name
above the door in my office in the Capitol.
"Francis" is better for libraries.
"Frank" is better for bumper stickers.
I got a few of those.
Does anybody ever actually call you Francis?
Claire does. She's the only one.
She seems like a real prize.
She is.
Bar was already shut down, but look what I scored.
Hi, Caroline.
  What do you want?   Is Paul around?
Paul? Did you invite this man?
Answer me. Did you invite him?
What are you talking about?
Caroline, stop!
No, you're not going to stop me.
Paul? You got a minute to talk?
There's nothing to talk about.
I want to apologize for when I saw you last time
in Washington, how I treated you.
Is that it?
And I want to talk about the shipyard.
I got a plan to fix it.
You don't want everything going into the Roth IRA.
I'll set you up with a nice, diversified package.
Low-risk, high-yield.
I think Claire and I have things pretty well under control.
If I brought a senior U.S. Congressman into the fund,
that would really up my stock in the company.
What are you all gabbing about back there?
We're talking about the old library.
Yeah, what's happening to it?
They gonna tear it down?
I don't know.
They could gut it.
They could turn it into a student center.
We should sneak in there.
Like we used to.
  I'm game.   Do it.
Hell, why not?
That's it. There you go. That's it.
Shh. It's a library.
This is the Sentinel...
The association had about  million saved up
in reserve for emergencies.
Split that up between , members, it's nothing.
A couple of weeks' groceries.
There's a bill I'm working on.
Major federal funds going towards public parks,
green commercial spaces, cleaning up waste sites.
That's construction jobs, park management, retail...
  How many?   , jobs.
  That's not even half.   It's a start.
  How soon?   A year, maybe two.
Two fucking years?
What are we supposed to do until then?
Listen, there's a community meeting tomorrow.
I heard.
I'm gonna go over everything in detail.
  You gonna be there?   Wasn't planning on it.
I'd like you to be there.
Everybody respects you.
Want me to vouch for you?
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that
only a handful of people know.
I'm running for governor.
I announce soon.
But I need the association behind me before I do that.
Now, I know I let you down with the shipyard.
But if I win a governor's race,
I can get everything back on track.
You show up on my doorstep asking for my forgiveness.
Now you want me to be your lapdog after I lost my fucking job?
This watershed bill is just the beginning.
If I'm governor, there's so much I can do.
It's bullshit. You just want to use me.
It's not like that.
Yeah. It's exactly like that.
Jesus Christ, Pete.
You fucking politicians.
Paul.
Claire.
I didn't realize you and Frank were staying here.
We always stay here when we're in Charleston.
You know that, Remy.
The ' campaign.
I promise it was a coincidence
my assistant booked it.
Is, uh, Frank around?
He's not. He's off cavorting with old classmates.
You want to sit down and have a drink?
They booked me the bridal suite.
There's champagne on ice.
My, my, you've grown very confident
since you worked for Francis.
I've always been confident, Claire.
Oh, you never would have invited me upstairs.
Never had the bridal suite.
The staff always stayed in the Best Western
four blocks away.
Enjoy your champagne.
I wasn't suggesting anything more than a drink.
Weren't you?
Purely being polite.
Good night, Remy.
The bridal suite's on the top floor
at the end of the hallway,
if you change your mind.
Good night, Claire.
 I know a girl upon a hill 
 I know a girl all dressed in pink 
   She made my...      Fingers stink 
 Sound off, oo-wah 
 Make it loud 
Here you go.
Hey, Kenny, I think you got a little too big for this.
I think the hole got a lot smaller.
Don't let a little girth stop you.
Here it is. Look, look, look.
Oh, oh, you found it, killer.
Oh, wow, look at that.
 Oh, Shenandoah 
 I long to hear you 
 Far away you rolling river 
 Oh, Shenandoah 
 Just to be near you 
 Far away 
 Around the way 
 Cross the wide Missouri 
Good, and you?
Oh, I'm in Charleston, actually.
What are you doing here?
I thought I'd surprise you.
Surprise.
Come on. Let me show you where I went through puberty.
I can totally see you here at .
Got in some trouble on this bed, huh?
Woke up the whole block.
Hey, how'd it go with Paul?
He told me to fuck off.
Which is what my mother told me,
in her own special way.
Am I going to meet her?
You don't want to meet her.
I just wanted to stop by,
say hey, see her face.
Christina, it was really sweet of you to come up here.
Seriously, I'm officially convinced
you're the most amazing woman I've ever been with,
but I meant it when I said I wanted to take this trip alone.
This thing tomorrow isn't going to be pleasant.
Which is why I came... to be here for you.
Moral support.
I know these people.
They're going to lay into me big time.
Tomorrow's an important day for the campaign.
Don't fight me on this.
Okay.
So do I get a hotel?
Do I stay here?
Come on. Don't be like that.
A hotel would be more comfortable.
But it would be a waste of valuable campaign funds.
Oh, campaign funds.
You see that crack up in the ceiling?
I used to fall asleep staring at it every night.
I know every inch and curve.
It's dark in here. I'm scared.
Be fucking careful, man!
Let there be light!
What were you thinking about?
How come you and Frank have never had kids?
You've never had kids.
Yeah, but I'm not married.
Answer the question.
We just decided not to.
There wasn't some big conversation.
I think you're lying.
Think whatever you want.
You've honestly never thought about it?
I mean, yeah, maybe, once or twice.
I mean, I don't feel there's some void.
I'm perfectly happy without.
What about you?
Can you imagine me wiping a baby's ass and changing nappies?
No, I can't.
Actually, yes, I just did.
I'm gonna have to get off the phone.
You've ruined everything.
Well, we really should get off.
It's been... over an hour, I think.
Okay.
  Go on then.   I'm hanging up right now.
No, I am.
Come on. Don't quit on me.
Oh, I lost count.
Don't be... don't quit.
Oh... oh, God!
Oh, you win.
Oh, but it's not a fair fight.
You run a rafting company.
I sit behind a desk all day.
Oh, I'd love to see your ass with a paddle,
bouncing through a class-four rapid.
If I can whip congress into submission,
I'm not afraid of a little white water.
You can't tame a rapid, Frank.
My heart is beating so fast...
If I have a heart attack, it's your fault.
Mine too.
Here.
I need another drink.
I think I'll have another too.
Don't bogart that.
Do you think this place made us?
How do you mean?
When I walked on campus today,
I wondered, "Did it mean anything?
"If it's just a place we spent four years of our lives...
or was there more?"
I don't know.
I do know you were always the guy
that was gonna get a building named after him.
I knew that the moment I saw you
cuss out the drill sergeant when we were knobs.
The library is a sham.
Higgins asked me a favor.
I asked someone else a favor.
They slapped my name on it.
Politics. Like everything else.
Not everybody gets asked those favors.
Or knows how to deliver on 'em.
Oh, in  years they'll just replace it with something else.
Just like they're doing with this for mine.
You still built something. However long it lasts.
The library doesn't matter.
But I want to think this place did.
I think it meant a lot to us. Then.
And what about us?
Honestly, I haven't really thought about it that much.
It's a long time ago.
We were so close.
Like brothers.
More than brothers.
We were kids, Frank.
We messed around a couple of times.
I was so drawn to you.
I could always make you laugh.
How did we lose touch?
You went to law school. I joined the army.
You ran for congress, I... I moved to Colorado.
I got children older than we were back then.
Do you have anyone, Frank?
I have Claire.
Besides Claire.
I have. From time to time.
If I want someone, I want them.
It's attraction.
Made me happy to make you happy, Frank.
Didn't see any harm in it.
You know why I love rafting?
When you're on the water,
all you're thinking about is what's right in front of you.
Everything is in the moment.
I don't really have time to think about the past.
You meant something to me.
I believe that.
All gone.
I don't feel so well.
You gonna be sick?
No. No, I just...
take a break.
Can we just take a...
for a little bit?
Until I feel better.
Take as long as you like.
I got nowhere to go.
It's almost :.
I don't even wanna sleep.
Come on.
One... Two... Three... Four...
One, two, three, four,
we are the Sentinel.
  , acres are developed.   Yes.
    public parks.   Yep.
    shopping offices.   Yes.
You going?
Is it required?
I don't think so.
Who is he that they're naming the place after?
Some guy who went here. I think he's dead.
We had to set up the chairs yesterday.
It was hot as shit.
That sucks.
I'm gonna try to get some shut-eye before the ceremony.
  I'll see you all later?   Later it is.
Frank, before I forget, here's my card.
So your money manager can call me.
Get some rest.
Claire.
You look like you're hurting.
It was an all-nighter.
  Was it fun at least?   It was fun.
I need to get some shut-eye.
Remy's staying here.
He harassing you about the donations?
Oh, nothing I can't handle.
Go get some rest.
  Were you good?   Not bad.
I mean, I wasn't a starter,
but I got my time on the court.
I think you look sexier now all grown up.
Congressman? We're ready for you.
You said two years.
I think two years is a realistic estimate.
If it passes at all.
Which I think it will.
You think or you know?
I can't predict  , but I'm confident it will.
You think, you're confident,
you can't predict  .
How does any of that help us?
I'll tell you something.
I am   unable to pay my mortgage right now.
I'm   unable to buy my kids school supplies.
We supposed to live off my husband's disability?
There'll be paid training programs available.
How much will they pay?
Uh, granted, it's less than you made at the shipyard.
  So how much?   It's about   an hour.
That's not even minimum wage.
You have to see it as an investment.
The training programs are a valuable resource.
You're not getting it.
I can't afford to make investments.
Six dollars an hour puts my family on the street.
What do you want me to work? Five jobs?
If you get a part-time job, that and the training programs...
Do you wanna know what I think?
I think you sit around in Washington
coming up with all sorts of fancy numbers and solutions
that look good on paper.
But that doesn't cut it for the rest of us.
You said you had our backs, you lying piece of shit!
We don't eat paper for dinner.
You can't put a paper roof over your head.
When we all voted for you,
I didn't think that every one of those votes
was another nail in our own coffin.
Everybody just sit down for ten minutes.
We can go over this proposal point by point
and you can get the information that you need
to get the resources that you want.
It's like they don't want to find a solution.
They're scared.
I understand that they're scared,
but that doesn't mean they can't listen.
You don't know these people, Christina.
I worked in your office for three years.
I spoke to them. I took their calls.
I replied to their emails.
You didn't grow up with them.
I don't need to grow up hand to mouth
to empathize with the fact that...
they're not interested in empathy.
The house keys are in my jacket.
I'll call you.
  Peter.   I said I'll call you.
Do your homework. It's Sister Mary Joseph.
You didn't do it. Don't lie to me.
I used to use the same ploy with my parents.
Nah, baloney.
We do the homework and then we eat.
All right, who's hungry?
  What do you guys want?   Hamburgers.
You know mommy makes macaroni...
No, pizza.
No pizza. You guys can eat that every...
sweetheart, take the kids upstairs.
How'd you get in here?
You still keep the spare key
behind the loose brick on the porch.
You break into my house?
You scare my kids like that?
We gotta talk, Paul.
We talked last night. Now get out.
I can convince these people, but I need your help.
  Leave my house.   Sit down.
I don't wanna have to hurt you with my children upstairs, Petey.
Then help me.
This is your last chance.
I'm not going anywhere.
Get back upstairs!
What are we doing?
I don't wanna fight you, Petey.
I don't wanna fight you either.
I will.
But we don't have to.
What do you want me to do?
You elected me to represent you,
but I couldn't forestall the inevitable.
The shipyard was closing.
If not this year, then next.
Or the year after.
We all know that.
I could have lied to you.
I could have pretended to do more.
But I don't believe about living in the past.
I only care about the future.
Here's another truth that's gonna be hard to swallow.
I'm all you've got.
Nobody in Washington gives a fuck about you.
No one.
He's right.
Whatever you think of Petey,
we either go with him or we got nothin'.
Now, does what I'm offering you
come anywhere near what you want or deserve? No.
But you gotta open your eyes and take what's in front of you.
We can build on that.
Then ,. Not in the snap of a finger,
but faster than doing nothing will.
Can I count on all of you?
All right, I'll take that as a yes.
We'll need your contact information
so we can send you materials to share with your friends.
Now, let's talk about the way
the money's gonna get phased in.
It's gonna happen in six stages. Stage one...
 Oh say does that star-spangled 
 Banner yet wave 
 For the land of the free 
 And the home of the brave 
Left face. Forward march.
Francis Underwood's career.
Harvard law degree.
One of the youngest state legislators in the history of South Carolina.
A  year veteran of the U.S. Congress.
House majority whip.
Speaks volumes about the values young people learn here
at the Sentinel.
Values like honor, duty, discipline,
like sacrifice, service, and respect.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Francis J. Underwood library.
Congressman?
Thank you.
I wrote a speech.
But I'm not gonna read it.
Nothing is permanent. Not even this building.
I don't mean to sound ungrateful.
I am very grateful. I'm deeply honored.
And I am...
I'm very moved.
I had the good fortune of spending most of this weekend
with a group of friends.
Friends I haven't seen in a very long time.
Friends I made here.
Most of you young cadets probably, uh, don't know who I am.
A politician, a name, a few accomplishments.
But I don't blame you.
When I was your age,
why, I didn't care much for what men in gray hair did
or what they had to say.
I...
I wish I could describe...
Harmony. That's the word that stuck in my mind.
Harmony.
It's not about what's lasting or permanent.
It is about individual voices coming together.
For a moment.
And that moment lasts...
the length of a breath.
That's what I think about my time here.
You'll have to forgive me.
I had more than a few whiskeys last night.
You know, when I was a cadet, we could drink all night
and then get up in the morning and march  Miles,
but these days I'm lucky I got up these three steps.
I wanna thank you very much.
This is a great honor.
I wanna thank president Higgins
and of course the love of my life, Claire.
Thank you all very much.
  You okay?   Yes.
Hi, ma.
This is Christina. I told you about her yesterday.
  Hi, Mrs. Russo.   Hey.
We just came by to say goodbye.
  We have to catch a train in about an hour.   Okay.
  They still haven't fixed that light?   Uh-uh.
Things went well today.
I think the folks in the yard are gonna get behind me.
Peter did a great job.
Hand me that blanket.
The A.C. in here is nuts.
What happened to your hand?
I got in a fight.
Did you win?
Yeah, I guess I did.
That's my Peter.
So you're fucking my son.
Lighten up. I'm just messing with you.
Excuse me.
Yeah. Hold on a second. Yeah?
Yeah, my mother's in room .
She has a light out that needs to be replaced.
All right. I'll take care of it.
Okay, thanks.
Look, babe, if you put that pink thing on,
I'm telling you...
Hold on. What is it?
The light in my mother's room.
I told you I'll take care of it later.
No, you'll take care of it now.
I gotta go.
And turn the A.C. down while you're in there too.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.
You're very welcome, sir.
You take care of yourself.
I'm real proud of you, Frank.
I hate to admit it, but I feel the same.
Well, having all you here was what made it special.
Now you stay in touch.
  Will do.   See ya, buddy.
Beautiful ceremony, Frank.
Yeah, they did a good job.
Your speech. I'm glad I was here for that.
Me too.
You should come out to Salida sometime.
I'll take you out on the Arkansas river.
  I should do that.   Any time you want.
Yep.
All right.
Francis?
Edward has the car ready.
I'll be right there.
Take your time.
You hear from Peter?
Looks like the shipbuilders are on board.
Tomorrow morning we start working on his draft
  for his announcement speech.   Got it.
And I want the brief on the mock-up for the watershed bill.
I got that with me.
Ride with me to the airport.
We'll go through it in the car.House.of.Cards.SE
When the enemy attacked, you ran away.
That's treason.
Now it's time to splatter your brains everywhere.
Please! Please, don't kill me!
Shut up! Die like a man!
But I have a wife and family.
That's what happens to cowards.
Hey, shh, shh, shh! You have to keep it down.
  There's an important meeting going on.   Sorry.
I'll set you up in the copy room.
You won't be in the way there.
This is gonna be a close vote.
Most of your colleagues are not gonna wanna spend
this amount of money in just  districts.
Try persuasion first.
Talking points are in your packets.
And if you want more detailed information...
research, statistics... you can contact Gillian or myself.
And when it comes to doling out favors, talk to Doug.
If favors don't work, come to me directly. Peter.
I'll be campaigning in Pennsylvania.
All my events this week
will be in counties within the watershed,
so I'll be working the media angle.
But if you need me to get on the phone with anybody,
reach out to Christina.
She'll work it into my schedule.
I have to say, Frank,
  million is going to be a hard sell.
The natural gas lobby's already putting up a big fight.
We need to make this about jobs.
But the drilling industry
can offer far more jobs than this bill can.
This bill doesn't threaten those jobs,
it just makes sure the drilling is done responsibly.
It adds more jobs on top of that.
I've already been approached by Sancorp with reelection funds.
I have too. They offered me a donation package
from eight different drilling companies.
  Remy Danton?   Yep.
How many of you been approached by Remy?
Look, I know it's not easy to turn down money.
But if the Republicans control redistricting in Pennsylvania,
we lose the house next election,
and all of you lose your committee chairmanships.
This is a feather that we need in Peter's hat.
A loss on this bill endangers his chance of winning,
and we are fighting to keep our majority here.
Any other concerns?
tomorrow afternoon.
Thank you all very much.
It's brutal.  stops in three days.
  That's a lot of sleeping on the bus.   No sleeping.
That bus is the only place I can get work done.
You know, Francis did a big bus tour in ',
and the bus lost its brakes going down a hill,
and we landed in a tobacco field.
He gets out of the car, knocks on the farmer's door,
writes a check for all the damaged crops,
and then borrows his pickup so he doesn't miss the next event.
And it was actually fun.
He was driving. I was shotgun.
We had the whole staff in the flatbed.
We actually got there ten minutes early.
I think I should be here to help drum up votes.
Careful, sir. It's very hot.
Look, you and the vice president will get national coverage.
That's gonna help us with the count.
I reached out to him. He never got back to me.
I don't know if he even knows the talking points about the bill.
I don't think Jim wants to go.
He's doing it as a favor to the president and I,
so it doesn't matter if he doesn't know the talking points.
You know, people wanna see him be folksy, you know?
So just humor him. Show him some degree of...
Oh, my God.
  Are you okay?   It was an accident.
Okay, it's time for us to go. I'm so sorry.
It's all right. I just need to run it under some cold water.
I'm not going to lie.
I despise children.
There. I've said it.
You can't act like that in here.
  You have to be a big boy.   I know.
Peter, we really need to get going.
We've already missed one flight because the meeting went over.
, but...
We have to drop the kids off at school.
It's going to be really tight.
If we miss this plane, we have to cancel our first event.
Nancy, can you take them?
I've gotta get packets ready for the lunchtime sub-caucuses.
Peter, I'd do it,
but we have a meeting with Greenpeace in  minutes.
I gotta get their rating on the bill.
Where's their school?
Connecticut and Q.
  Oh, I can take them.   You sure?
Yes. It's on the way to my office.
This watershed act proves that once again
the anti-capitalist agenda
is alive and well in the Democratic party.
Let me show you what's really going on.
Here are the democrats eating up all of their
soft science, "Organically homegrown" propaganda
that the eco-fanatics are force-feeding them.
And over here, at the tail end of all those jackasses,
are middle-class Americans...
people who just want to work hard
and rely on jobs in the drilling industry.
And what about the hypocrisy, folks?
Does Peter Russo honestly have the gall
to lecture us on the purity of our rivers
when he has been polluting himself with chemicals for years?
He's not just been eating grass, he's been smoking it.
It's the only major bill he's sponsored in six years.
I know, but they already have national coverage.
What's the angle?
If it doesn't pass,
I think he'll lose support from the shipbuilders' association.
So they lose support. It's not that juicy.
They're a huge part of his get-out-the-vote effort in Philly.
It sounds like inside baseball.
Not if I get the vote count. Black and white numbers.
Nobody has that. But when I called the campaign,
they stonewalled me.
Same thing in the whip's office.
Do you know anyone over there?
In Underwood's office?
No, I don't.
Nobody on staff?
I just figured because you gave me the Russo profile.
No, that didn't come from them.
But Underwood organized the campaign.
I'm sorry. I don't know anybody there.
Okay.
Hey, it's me. I just wanted to fill you in on something.
. Meet me there.
  Sarah made this one.   It's a frog.
And I made this one. Can you guess what it is?
  A lobster?   No. It's a scorpion.
They're for you. For the ones you gave us.
Aw, they're beautiful.
But maybe you should bring them to school, no?
For show-and-tell? Or give them to your friends.
No. The other kids will just make fun of us.
Why?
Everybody hates us at school.
They say dad's a crackhead and that we're crack babies.,
I looked up "Crack baby" on the computer.
I don't look like that.
Yeah, they say dad's gonna O.D. like Amy Winehouse.,
Well, you tell them
that your dad doesn't do that kind of thing anymore, right?
Yeah, we do, but they don't believe us.
Did you try going to the teachers?
We can't do that. Everyone will just hate us even more.
Well, you can't worry about what other people think, right?
I wish dad wasn't running for Governor.
  You ever been to Allentown before?   I have not.
What do you think?
Compared to New York, the parking is easier.
Finding a decent bagel, not so much.
We make up for it with the cream cheese.
  Shall we?   Ready when you are.
Your watershed bill.
You've ticked off the Republicans, oil, gas...
Sometimes you gotta upset a few people to do the right thing.
Not just a few.
There's a sizable coalition that wants to see your bill fail,
including environmentalists from your own party.
Don't think the bill does enough.
We wanted a passable bill.
That's why we aimed for middle ground...
Do you actually care about the Delaware river?
I don't sponsor legislation I don't care about.
Until recently, you hadn't sponsored any legislation at all.
I spent my time in congress focusing on things
that were important to my constituents.
The shipyard.
Kept it open as long as I could.
Okay. That's one thing. What are the others?
I'd love to provide you a list
of all the things I've done in congress,
but we've got  minutes...
Your opponent has linked your inactivity
to your fondness for single-malts.
I've been very open about my past,
and I've done everything I can to overcome it
in a responsible, permanent way.
And I preferred vodka to scotch.
You should get your facts straight.
Is your watershed act
just a ploy to jump into the spotlight
and pad your transcript while you apply for Governor school?
It's real money.
It's real jobs.
And when the Delaware river is less
polluted than it's been in  years...
it's holding up a real glass of its water
and seeing how clear it is.
That's what my bus tour is about.
  The vice president is joining you later?   Correct.
Why has it taken him this long to endorse you?
He didn't think I was worth it.
But then he heard I had a one-on-one with the New York Times,
and, boom, he was on board.
I might print that.
The more of my words, the fewer of yours,
the better off we'll both be.
If I didn't think you were such a liability to yourself, congressman,
I might even like you.
If your circulation was as high as the Wall Street Journal,
I might like you back.
Hit me. Next question.
I have to put up a fight, Frank.
Tell them they're wasting their money.
  It's gonna pass.   Are you sure?
When was the last time I got a count wrong?
If you were certain, you wouldn't be trying to neutralize us.
Well, Sancorp has been good to me.
I'm just trying to do you and them a favor, Remy.
Then why propose the legislation in the first place?
You must've known they would oppose it.
The regulatory restrictions are minimal.
There's a bigger battle here, Frank.
Sancorp is against any step toward regulation,
no matter how small.
Russo's planted his feet on the wrong side of the fence.
How much are you giving his opponent?
Check the F.E.C. filings.
How much are you actually giving?
This is a ten-billion-dollar industry, Frank.
There's money to spend.
If the democrats lose Pennsylvania,
you know what that means.
We don't want you to lose leadership,
but that's up to you, not us.
You don't have the same kind of relationship
with the republicans that you have with me.
Then we'll adapt.
We both have votes to count. Good luck.
You tell Sancorp they're being foolish.
I'm not gonna do that.
Well, then, you're being foolish.
Come on, Frank.
Let's not make this personal.
I can't compete with Sancorp's war chest.
My only option is asymmetrical...
to pick off the opposition one by one
like a sniper in the woods.
There will come a time to put Remy in my crosshairs,
but not right now.
As we used to say in Gaffney,
never slap a man while he's chewing tobacco.
Congressman, how are you?
I deeply appreciate you taking the time out of your schedule...
Hank, I need to eat.
See if you can muster up a club sandwich, extra bacon.
Fuck me.
Thai cuisine again.
The green curry is for you, and the other green curry is for me.
I was actually just on my way out.
I bought you dinner. You have to eat it.
Or at the very least, you have to watch me eat mine.
I'm gonna be late to meet someone.
  Who? Like a date?   A friend.
Oh, the mysterious fuck-buddy who you get all of your stories from?
Lighten up. I was just teasing.
Not that I would judge.
We've all done it.
I used to suck, screw,
and jerk anything that moved just to get a story.
Really? Like who?
You want dish?
No. It's just...
The com director on Ben Schroeder's senate race.
A staffer in the Defense Department.
My very own White House intern.
He was a real blabbermouth when he wasn't eating me out.
And I even had a fling with a congressman.
Which one?
You tell me yours, and I'll tell you mine.
I've never been with any.
Oh, come on. You're hot.
You're telling me that none of them have come on to you?
I haven't really been in those circles.
You are now.
I guess I don't really give off that vibe.
Oh, you mean the slut vibe?
Look, I don't do that shit anymore.
'Cause once word got out,
it was like I hit a wall, and nobody took me seriously.
So, a piece of advice as far as career strategies go:
It's not worth fucking your way to the middle.
Chopsticks or fork?
Look, if you go, I am gonna have to eat both of these,
and that is not cool.
No. I'll eat with you.
Good.
Back home, Meechum.
Sir.
Francis...
How's your hand?
Fine.
You should change the bandage, no?
Later.
I thought you were gonna be out late.
No.
  You seem upset.   I'm not.
  What happened?   Nothing.
Can I get more than two words out of you?
I'm just trying to relax.
Claire,
I love you.
I love you too.
Did Zoe expect me to twiddle my thumbs until her arrival?
Perhaps she's making the mistake
thinking her time is as valuable as mine.
Proximity to power deludes some into believing they wield it.
I put an end to that sort of thinking before it begins.
And if I'm not mistaken, the last time I was in Tannersville,
Buddy Corcharan pulled me aside
and told me I was wasting my time,
because the Republicans
were gonna sweep Monroe County in a landslide.
Well, Buddy had to eat his hat and both his shoes,
when I won the county in a landslide.
And let me tell you, that man has big feet
and an even bigger head, so that was quite a meal.
My daddy used to tell me a story
about people who count their chickens before they hatched.
Although, to be fair,
he probably didn't know what he was talking about,
because he grew up in Pittsburgh.
And I certainly never saw a hen around my house,
unless you count my mother.
  Do you want me to do something?   But, seriously,
  No. Let him talk.   ...I do love this town...
I don't know if he's ever going to introduce you.
Because it still has that frontier spirit.
He will. Just give him time.
It's been an hour.
We were supposed to leave for Carbondale ten minutes ago.
I can't interrupt him. He's the Vice President.
We're not on the edge of Penn's Woods.
We need economic development flowcharts
for the watershed bill sent over to Terry Womack's office.
  Hard copies,  of them.   I'll do it right away.
How's everything going with Rachel?
I think she's a little down in the dumps.
She got a waitressing job last week,
and then they let her go.
  Why?   She wouldn't tell me.
All she said was her boss was a creep.
Thirty minutes ago, I received a text from Zoe.
She intends to apologize, no doubt.
I respect that she wants to atone in person,
even though it's taken her over  hours to build up the courage.
Janine Skorsky is digging into Peter Russo.
What in particular?
The shipbuilders' association.
She have an angle?
The watershed bill is a consolation prize for them losing their jobs.
That's not an unfair assessment.
She thinks if the bill fails to pass,
they'll withdraw support.
Not an unfair speculation.
Well, I know how hard you've been working on his campaign,
so I wanted to give you a heads-up.
Well, let me know if she expands her inquiry.
  Into what?   Anything you deem worth telling.
Well, can I throw her a bone?
She might be more talkative if I have information for her.
  What sort of bone?   The vote count for the bill.
I don't have a vote count yet.
Should have a preliminary one this afternoon.
  You'll let me know?   As soon as I have something solid.
There's one more thing.
About last night...
Oh, no need to apologize.
I'm sure you had a very good reason.
I do.
I think we should end it.
Not professionally, the other thing.
Why now?
We have a really good working relationship.
I don't wanna overcomplicate that.
All right.
  You're okay with it?   Completely.
It's over.
And it won't change things in terms of our arrangement?
Oh, please. I don't punish people for making adult decisions.
Thank you, Francis.
She was never more than a faint blip on my radar.
We've served each other's purpose.
If she wants to be an adult,
let her see how she can fly once she leaves the nest.
  Claire.   Catherine.
Thank you for fitting me in.
Oh, I can always find time for you and Frank.
Well, the reason I'm here is the C.W.I. has
a large shipment of water filters stuck in South Sudan,
and they've been in storage for the past four months,
just sitting there, and the Sudanese government...
Won't release the shipments through customs.
My deputy briefed me on the latest.
Right. And I know that Francis
spoke to you about this not too long ago,
but lately we haven't heard much from the state department,
so I was wondering if you could help.
We've done our best, Claire.
I put my top people on this.
The Sudanese are just not responding.
Well, is there anything else we can do?
There's over  , worth of equipment.
I wish I could. I know how important this is to you,
but we're about to cut off diplomatic ties.
It's a directive straight from the President.
We can't ignore their human rights violations anymore.
What about back channels?
Well, once we cut ties, I can't contact their government
officially or unofficially.
Well, is there someone you could put me in touch with?
I'm sorry, Claire. My hands are tied.
I would move mountains for you and Frank,
but I've done all I can.
Of course.
  Okay. Good to see you.   You too.
Congressman, you have a major bill
going to the floor later this week.
  Are you optimistic it'll pass?   I'm very optimistic.
The Delaware river watershed Act not only protects
large portions of the state's freshwater resources,
it also creates thousands of jobs.
I'm confident that my colleagues on the Hill...
There's only one way to create jobs.
I did it during my administration.
The answer is tax credits for small businesses.
You've got to encourage self-starting entrepreneurs
to start new ventures,
  hire employees...   But specifically,
  about the watershed act...   Small businesses,
that's the solution. Everything else is window dressing.
Thank you all very much.
Thank you.
Good night, Mr. Vice-President.
Hello.
I need to talk about Matthews.
Yes. I read the press reports.
He's not being very helpful, is he?
He's doing more harm than good.
I want to ask him to leave.
Well, that wouldn't make for a very good story.
It's better than him torpedoing the whole bus tour.
Have you tried to talk to him?
No, I wanted to ask your advice first.
Well, maybe there's a way
to keep him on the tour and inspire his support.
We have fundamentally different views.
Well, look, you're not going to be able change his ideology,
but dig deeper.
Jim is a proud man. Tap into that pride.
I just wish he was gone.
Well, you do whatever you think best.
But whatever it is you decide,
be firm and stand up for yourself.
He'll respond to that at least.
And call me back if you need anything.
What was the reason he gave you? Were you messing up?
No. The head waiter said I was doing a really good job.
He even started letting me take my own tables on the second day.
And then the manager... what's his name?
Leon.
He propositioned you?
Called me into his office,
said couldn't afford to start taking anyone new on, even part-time.
Put his hand on my knee, said he might be able to make an exception.
So he started sliding his hand up my thigh.
So I stood up and I tell him I should get back to work.
He says, "Stay." He unbuckled his belt.
Did you?
No, I walked out of the office and got back to my tables.
Next day, I came into work, told me to go home.
I was fired.
Tell me the name of the restaurant.
You're home early.
I needed a breather.
I didn't have breakfast this morning.
I might head back in a little while.
The vote count?
It's going to come down to the wire on this one.
I spoke to Catherine Durant today.
She's unable to get the shipment out of South Sudan.
Yeah, we're cutting all diplomatic ties.
Foreign Affairs is up in arms about it.
Yes. Which is why she can't lift a finger, according to her.
It's what she said anyway. Anyway, I need you to talk to her.
I don't think that would make any difference.
I thought she owed us, Francis.
She does, but there's limits.
She's Secretary of State.
She can't break diplomatic protocol.
Well, can you make some calls?
If she can't, I can't.
Plus I have to focus on the watershed bill.
I'm taking time out of my schedule to help you with that.
  Because you drafted it.   Because you asked me.
I didn't want to do this.
All I'm asking is that you give me a little bit of your time in return.
And how am I supposed to fix a problem I can't fix?
What about Remy?
Glendon Hill must have contacts in South Sudan.
He's fighting us on the vote.
Those are two completely separate issues.
They are not.
He does you a favor, he hangs it over me.
So what you're saying is my goals are secondary to yours.
That is not what I'm saying.
I think you don't want to go hat in hand
to somebody who used to work for you.
I will not be lectured to the moment you walk in the door!
I called Catherine, as promised!
Her inability to deliver is not my problem or my fault!
I cannot control changing global landscapes!
And I will not be cornered into making promises I cannot deliver!
I am sorry I yelled.
I'm under a lot of pressure.
You're right, I didn't think it through.
I just can't go to Remy right now.
He's poaching too many of my people.
I've got two congressmen
who will not commit.
I was hoping you might speak to them.
Who?
Vanderburgh and Abrams.
What is it that you want me to say to them?
They're big on the environment.
They don't think the bill goes far enough.
They respect your opinion.
I wanted you to walk them through the bill step-by-step.
Put them at ease. I need to get them in the yes column.
I meet with them tomorrow. I'll deliver the bruises.
You meet with them later and patch them up.
That might just do the trick.
Of course.
I think I broke the bowl.
We have contacts there through our oil interest.
I'm going to need government intervention.
Wherever there's a government, we know people.
Even when there's only the illusion of a government.
Will you help me?
I'd like to.
But for something like this, I'm afraid there's a price tag.
The C.W.I. will endorse Sancorp as eco-friendly.
They can use our logo on any PR
or marketing materials you want.
We'll need more than that.
They were willing to donate over a million for that.
These filters are only worth  ,.
I'd say that's a bargain.
You turned down that offer.
Landscape has shifted since then.
  The watershed bill?   That's right.
You want it amended?
I want you to kill it, the whole thing.
C.W.I. has publicly backed the bill, Remy.
What you do publicly is your concern.
Gentlemen. Please, have a seat.
So have either of you changed your mind since we last spoke?
We're still undecided, Frank.
Leaning one way or the other?
If congress is going to allocate a quarter billion dollars,
we want to make sure it goes towards a
bill that does more to protect the...
We've been through all that. I know your concerns.
So if the protection standards don't change,
we would rather see that money spent more effectively elsewhere.
That sounds like you're both leaning no.
We've been very clear about what we're asking.
Okay.
This is you, Abrams.
And this is you, Vanderburgh.
And over here...
is the majority of the Democratic caucus.
See, you're over there all by your lonesome.
Now, you don't mind being the black sheep.
You're the liberal wing of the liberal wing.
Most of the time you can vote what you want,
we still pass things anyway.
But this time
it does matter.
And what the two of you aren't taking into account
is between this end of the desk and this end of the desk...
is me.
Now, I'm going to say to you what I say to every congressman
that sits where you're sitting now.
Vote your district. Vote your conscience.
Don't surprise me.
And the most important one of those...
is don't surprise me.
Now, you're both to meet with my wife tomorrow.
And you're to hear her out.
She will go through your concerns point-by-point.
And I am certain after that
that the two of you will make the right decision.
This is the part where you leave.
I have often found that bleeding hearts
have a ironic fear of their own blood.
One drop and they seize up.
But offer them a caring hand and massage them back to life
and they soon start beating to the right drum.
Hello.
I've just spoken to Abrams and Vanderburgh.
Let them toss and turn tonight,
but they're all yours tomorrow.
I'll reach out to their offices and set a time.
Thank you, Claire.
Of course. Whatever I can do to help.
Here you go, sir. Enjoy.
Excuse me.
There's a hair on my steak.
I am so sorry, sir. Where?
Right there.
I don't see it.
Are you telling me I'm blind?
No, sir. I'm so sorry.
  I'll have the kitchen...   What's your name?
Stephanie.
You can leave the plate, Stephanie.
I'd like to talk to the manager.
Yes, sir. I'll go get him.
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
Uh, Stephanie tells me there was a hair on your plate.
No.
There wasn't any hair.
Leon, right? That's your name?
Yes.
Stephanie is a hot little number, isn't she?
Nice ass.
Did you make her blow you before or after you hired her?
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
  Sit down, Leon.   Sir, I want you to go.
  I said sit.   Don't make me call the police.
I'll tell you what. You call the police,
I'll call the department of immigration
about the four undocumented employees
you have working in the kitchen.
Felony, Leon.
And I might also mention
your girlfriend, her mother, and her aunt
who also undocumented and
living in an apartment that you pay for.
Prison time for you,
deportation for them.
Not a pretty picture, is it?
Let's talk about Rachel Posner.
How close is it?
I should have the last two votes I need committed today.
I just want to make sure no one changes their mind.
I'd prefer not to
get embroiled in environmental issues at this time.
But it's also a jobs-creation package.
It's antagonizing oil and gas.
We can't afford that sort of battle
after all the capital we spent on education.
All I need is one public statement of support.
I won't do that. How about you take Linda tomorrow?
You set her up in your offices.
Any meetings or calls you might need to whip up votes,
you got her there.
Well, I can't afford to spend a whole day lobbying on the Hill.
Well, you got deputies.
Yes, I do.
Well, you're telling me you can't manage them from ten blocks away?
Of course I can, sir.
  Look, if it's too difficult...   No, no, no.
We'll help you out, Frank.
Won't we, Linda?
Yes. If you'll just excuse me,
I have a few things to rearrange on my schedule.
What else, Frank?
Tell me what Birch is up to.
No, I know I've already canceled twice.
They start next week.
Sweetie, I'm trying to figure this out.
  Linda.   Excuse me.
  Yes?   Just wanted thank you for agreeing to pitch in,
I know you have a full plate.
Of course, Frank.
Is everything all right? It sounds like...
Yes. What time do you want me to come by tomorrow?
Can we talk?
Can I just call you back in one second?
I will call you. Yes.
Linda, I am so sorry that the president has forced you into this.
It was not my intention.
If you would like, I can talk to congress...
No, it's not that.
It's... It's a personal matter. Don't worry.
Well, what is it? Maybe I can help.
Just... my son didn't get into Stanford.
I was supposed to meet with the Provost tomorrow
to see if I could get him to change his mind.
I asked the president if I could go,
and he said yes, but he must have forgotten.
You should go. I'm sure the president will understand.
No, no. I don't let
personal matters get in the way of my job, Frank.
Linda, you can't put your entire life on hold.
And certainly not at the expense of your own son.
Well, it has been at the expense of my son.
It's my fault he didn't get in.
I was on the campaign and I wasn't there for him.
His grades suffered. His application was...
I wasn't there, Frank.
But I figured if I could just
meet with the Provost face to face...
Okay, look, you're going to Stanford tomorrow.
If you show up at my office,
I won't let you in, so don't even consider it.
Frank, the president wants me to be...
He doesn't have to know.
I'm going to have one of my schedulers buy you a ticket.
The bill will be fine.
Frank.
You don't have to do this.
We may have our disagreements, Linda,
but that doesn't mean we can't look out for each other.
You tell them you're coming.
Test, test, test.
All right, Zoe. This is Dave, the senior producer in New York.
  We'll go live in four minutes.   Sounds good.
The first topic will be the congressional
agenda for the fall session,
then we'll move on to the midterms, then we'll wrap it up
with Peter Russo's race for Governor and his watershed bill.
Okay, great.
Taking you off mic until  out.
Hey, Janine, I have to talk about the watershed bill.
  Do you have a one-sheet?   Uh, yeah. Hold on.
Thanks.
Any word on the vote count?
Still no luck. I've called every democrat in the house
to cobble together a number, but no one's getting back to me.
So what can I say?
That there's a lot in flux, and it'll be tight.
Okay. Thanks.
Yeah. Sure thing.
Hey, Francis, it's me.
Call me back.
Yes.
Congressman Russo. He says it's urgent.
Fine.
Good morning, sir.
I'd like to talk about how the tour's going.
Well, let's talk on the bus. Don't we have an event at :?
There won't be any events until we talk.
You're hijacking the microphone.
You're contradicting everything I say.
We need to be promoting the watershed act.
Well, I appreciate your being so forthright.
Let me tell you what I don't appreciate.
The D.N.C. is running a man with zero track record,
except for substance abuse, to fill my shoes.
I realize you don't want to be here, sir,
but it seems like you're deliberately trying to sabotage my campaign.
Despite my better judgment, I'm trying to save it.
I know the people of this state better than you, Peter.
They don't want to hear about watersheds.
They want to hear about jobs.
Well, this week, they need to hear both.
Well, then, maybe I should just stand quietly beside you at the podium
and watch you lose.
  You don't think I can win, do you?   I'm not optimistic.
You lost the first two times you ran for Governor.
The third time, nobody thought you had a chance.
By September, you were  points down.
You were out of money.
You had to mortgage your own house
just to keep your staff on payroll.
I'm well aware of what I did. I was there.
My point is you kept going.
You hit  counties in less than  days,
and you proved everyone wrong.
Like it or not, it's my name on the ticket this time,
and I got the shot, and I'm gonna prove everyone wrong.
Just like you did. Including you, sir.
I would like your support, but if you won't give it, fine.
It won't stop me.
You think it's easy for me to be here?
I left the Governor's mansion right in my prime.
To be what? Vice president.
I thought that was a step up. But you know what?
I don't have a fucking shred of real influence.
I'm trotted around like a goddamn mascot,
and this is my home state.
I'm offering you influence, sir.
I'd like your guidance and your expertise.
But if that's not on the table, then, well...
With all due respect, Mr. Vice President,
you should head back to Washington.
Your husband was very explicit.
I would categorize it as a threat.
  What did he say exactly?   Not to surprise him.
Didn't he also tell you
to vote your district and your conscience?
He did, but those seemed far lower on his priority list.
Well, he would never fault you
if you had a compelling reason to do what you think is right.
I'm confused. Aren't you for this bill?
C.W.I. Is publicly for it.
Privately, I have my doubts for the same reasons you do.
I was under the impression
that we were here so you could persuade us to vote yes.
Oh, I'm not trying to persuade you of anything.

if the bill fails, it's not the end of the world.
We can always sponsor new legislation.
You know, something with stricter regulatory standards.
Just to be clear, you're telling us
you don't mind if we vote against the bill.
I'm simply saying what my husband would...
that you should vote your conscience.
  How are we looking?   We're short a vote.
I just got off the phone with Claire.
Vanderburgh and Abrams are on board.
  Those are definite yeses?   Definite.
We should be good.
Yes?
I've been trying to reach you since yesterday.
Well, I've been a bit busy counting votes.
You said you'd have a number for me.
Well, you should try my press office.
I did. They won't return my calls.
Well, the official word is it will be close.
I'm trying to get the unofficial word.
Oh, I can't appear to be playing favorites now, can I?
This isn't because of the other day, is it?
What other day?
You said we'd keep our professional relationship.
Well, this is what professional feels like.
The vice president of the United States, Jim Matthews!
Thank you.
It's good to be back in Bristol.
Go, warriors!
Now, you all know me. I'm a windbag.
I can go on until you all fall asleep,
get eight hours of shut-eye,
and wake up to find me still yapping.
And there's a lot I could say about this young man to my left.
The truth is, I've had a lot of doubts about him and his ideas,
about his past, about his youth.
But if you'll remember,
a lot of you had doubts about me the first time I ran.
And the second and the third.
But over the last few days,
traveling around the state with Peter,
I have to admit he's won me over.
He's smart, he's energetic,
and, most important, he's a fighter.
Now, it says "A fresh start" On that bus over there.
And that's the real truth,
because this young man will give our state
the fresh start it so desperately needs.
Ladies and gentlemen, the next Governor of Pennsylvania,
Peter Russo.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
How's it going, Bristol?
Today I'd like to talk to you about economic recovery.
Now, as many of you may be aware,
mostly because my opponent feels the need
to spend millions of dollars on TV ads about my past,
I know a thing or two about recovery.
I've learned a great deal through my personal struggles.
I've learned how to harness my strength and my resolve,
make them work for me,
much the way your Bristol watermills harnessed the power
of your beautiful Otter Creek
and the mighty Delaware river years ago.
Let me tell you how the Delaware river
will reinvigorate your economy for years to come!
We're going to get the shipment out of Sudan.
  That's great.   It might take a few weeks,
but I think you should start making arrangements for Botswana,
where you're gonna set up base camp and the depot.
Just send me a budget as soon as you've got one.
Claire, is there any way we can send someone in my place?
I thought you wanted to be on the ground.
I would, but I can't this time.
Why not?
I wasn't sure how to tell you this,
but I passed the  week mark.
You're expecting.
Gillian, that's wonderful. That...
When did this happen? Who's the father?
There was this guy I met overseas. Doctors without borders.
We had this thing. Then I left.
But he came back to the states a few months ago,
and that's when it happened.
Anyway, it didn't end well. But I want to keep the baby.
  And does he know?   He's married.
I shouldn't have. It was stupid.
You don't have to explain.
I'll need some time off at the beginning of march.
Of course.
And absolutely, we'll send someone else instead.
I appreciate it, Claire.
Sure.
You said medium-rare?
Just, uh, let me know if you guys need anything.
Who would you guess texted me just now?
I thought she'd last more than a couple days.
  Going somewhere?   Just for an hour or two.
I got one last holdout to whip.
What's the vote count on Russo's bill?
Oh, don't you wanna shower first
before we dirty ourselves with business?
I'll shower after you leave.
What's the vote count?
Your tone doesn't inspire me to be very forthcoming.
Oh, the fuck wasn't enough?
You need a special tone too?
Ooh, someone washed her mouth out with acid this morning.
Whatever it is you're grappling with,
I am sincerely not interested.
You're almost twice my age.
You said that didn't bother you.
I lied.
If you had a daughter, she'd be older than me.
In  years, I'll still be younger than you are now.
Well, I can't argue with basic arithmetic.
You don't find that disgusting?
I think you want me to.
But I've never considered this any more or less
than a transaction between two consenting adults.
If you just want the girl who will do your bidding for you,
you already have that.
Why do you need to fuck me?
I would remind you
that it was you who initiated our affair,
and it was you who came knocking at my door last winter.
And it was me who asked that we stop what we're doing now.
Which I respected
until you picked up a phone and asked me to come over tonight.
Because you wouldn't give me what I wanted unless I did.
So tell me, why do you need this?
You don't seem to get any pleasure out of it.
I know I certainly don't.
I seem to always leave you satisfied.
How do you know I'm not faking it?
Are you?
Doesn't it say a lot that you can't tell?
What do you think about when I'm up against the wall?
A great man once said
that everything in life is about sex...
Except sex.
Sex is about power.
So you need a whore,
which makes you a pimp.
I'm not a pimp. Just a very generous John.
Fine. As long as we're clear about what this is,
I can play the whore.
Now pay me.
The bill will pass. We have it by two votes.
You can pass that along to your friend, miss Skorsky.
If she must say such things in order to sleep at night, so be it.
Her loyalty costs me nothing but the occasional crumb of news.
Her hatefulness takes no toll at all.
You don't compensate a working girl so you can cuddle after.
Final voting...
A lot of small towns, some really great crowds.
No buses losing their brakes.
Oh, please now. When do you head back?
Tomorrow. We wanna do a press conference when all the votes are in.
  Members, please cast your votes now.   Are you all right?
I'm just a little nauseous. It'll pass. I'm okay.
  You said you're due in March?   March th.
It's so exciting. How's the morning sickness?
I think I'm over the hump.
I have to pee all the time. Weird cravings.
It was good to be on the road again. Invigorating.
Our internals are showing a nice bump in the numbers.
You made a big difference.
The president is grateful, and so am I.
Well, it's a team effort, right?
Excuse me. I have yet to say hello to your better half.
  How'd it go at Stanford?   Well, I think.
The Dean's a republican, so there was not a lot of small talk.
But he seemed open to considering it. We'll know more next week.
  That's terrific.   I appreciate your helping me out.
Oh, I didn't do anything. Anybody can book a plane ticket.
That's not true. You covered for me.
Well, we have to keep the important things in perspective, right?
Don't think it's bought you any favors.
Kindness isn't kindness if you expect a reward.
The man of the hour!
Not yet. The votes are still coming in.
Hey, how'd you vote? I voted yes.
Voting. I knew I forgot something.
We got this.
There's some sparkling grape juice there to celebrate.
   seconds remaining.    seconds.
Looking good.
Come on, everyone. Let's go.
Everyone's voting along party lines.
See? This is what happens when we all stick together.
This is an easy win for us.
  Vote now.   Ten seconds.
Come on.
This can't be happening.
Members, please cast your votes now.
Voting is closed.
Hr  is defeated.
  Doug.   I thought we had it.
So this means it's dead?
It's such a shame. All of that hard work.
I wanna know who lied.
committee chairmanshipHouse.of.Cards.SE
The whole reason we do these meetings, Frank,
is so I can get accurate information from you.
I always said it was going to be close.
Then why did every article I read yesterday
say the leadership was confident the bill would pass?
Do you know Janine Skorsky?
She used to be the Herald's White House correspondent.
I remember Janine.
She wrote an article for Slugline
reporting a verified vote count.
Once the media got ahold of that, it went everywhere.
I don't know where she got that number.
Maybe she made it up.
It doesn't matter if she made it up.
The democrats seem divided.
The leadership looks incompetent.
But compared to the the budget and our education act,
well, this was a minor bill, sir.
That happened to be in the national spotlight,
which is what you wanted.
I got the count wrong.
It rarely happens, but it happens.
What worries me is that the White House's influence
isn't translating into support on the hill.
Linda's involvement had no effect?
I wouldn't say that that's the case, sir.
Did you sense any push-back, any fallout
from the education battle?
Sir, the truth is I wasn't there.
I had to make a trip to California
to meet the Provost of Stanford for my son.
I told you about it last week.
It was my decision, sir.
I made a judgment call
that we could pass the bill without her help.
But, look, tight votes like this,
you can analyze them to death,
but at the end of the day, we came up short.
That's my fault, no one else's. Certainly not Linda's.
I shouldn't have gone.
The meeting didn't even work.
I thought you said they were reconsidering.
No. I got an e-mail this morning.
They decided not to overturn the admissions decision.
Oh, Christ. I'm sorry, Linda.
Not a great day so far.
But I appreciate your covering for me in there.
There may be a way to turn Linda's bad luck into my good fortune.
But first I must deal with treason within the ranks...
the two renegades who voted against the bill.
I have zero tolerance for betrayal,
which they will soon indelibly learn.
I know why you lost the vote.
Somebody got to Vanderburgh and Abrams.
Remy Danton.
Your wife.
I've got contacts on both their staffs.
There was a meeting between the three of them.
I know. I arranged it.
  She told them to vote no.   No, not true.
Sources on two different staffs saying the exact same thing?
That makes no sense.
I'm not telling you what makes sense,
I'm telling you facts.
This is a juicy story, Francis.
Carly will love it.
The majority whip's wife stabs him in the back.
Be careful, Zoe.
I'm feeding you.
Now you have to feed me.
So give me something better.
Are you going to answer my question?
Did she or didn't she?
Tell me now, or so help me God,
I will make it my mission in life
to not only destroy your careers,
but to obliterate all hope and happiness that you manage to cling to.
  She said it would be okay...   To backstab me?
To do what we thought was right.
So she did tell you to vote no.
She said it wouldn't be the end of the world if the bill failed.
Those were her exact words.
You discuss this with no one. Is that understood?
Do you blame yourself for not being in Washington to secure the votes?
A bill this size is a team effort.
There are a lot of sponsors.
But you were the chief sponsor and the bill manager.
That's true.
So shouldn't you have been in Washington?
I'm running for Governor.
I have a commitment to the people of my state.
Are you aware that the Swofford campaign
is putting out a new commercial today that says,
quote, "If Peter Russo can't follow through in congress,
can he follow through with sobriety?"
That's all. Thank you very much.
  Do you want to comment?   Thanks, guys.
Congressman!
All I said was what you always say... to vote their conscience.
You encouraged them to defy me.
I met with them. That's what you asked me...
No, that is not what you did.
I specifically told you I needed them to vote yes on this bill.
There was no room for interpretation.
It's a deliberate lie, so don't try to sugarcoat it, Claire.
I needed Remy's help. You wouldn't offer any.
Oh, wait.
You did this for Remy?
No. For myself. To get my shipment out of Sudan.
He provided assistance.
In exchange for defeating the bill.
No. In exchange for not helping it succeed.
Which is the same goddamn thing.
Do you realize you have endangered
everything that we have been working toward?
There was a timetable here, Claire.
We needed strong momentum right up until the last minute.
I can't operate based on plans you haven't shared with me.
Then you should've asked me first.
No, I'm not going to ask for your blessing
on every decision I make, Francis.
We make decisions together.
Yeah, well, it hasn't felt like that.
Not for the past six months.
I don't feel as though I'm standing beside you.
Other people know, Claire.
This could become a story about us.
And that's something you do not recover from.
  Who?   That's something that follows you for life.
Who knows?
Zoe.
I thought you said she could be trusted.
What about our trust?
You can't control her, can you, Francis?
She wouldn't have been a problem if you hadn't lied.
No, she wouldn't have been a problem
if you hadn't dropped your pants.
And you come in here, to my office, and berate me
when you're the one who's exposed us?
Don't you try to turn this around on me.
I fired half of my staff for us.
I have turned down donations for us.
I drafted Peter's bill for us.
I diverted time and energy away from my goals for us.
Okay, I don't wanna have to say this,
but maybe you need to hear it.
C.W.I. is important, yes,
but it doesn't come close to what we are trying to accomplish.
You must see that!
I'm just being honest.
Then be honest about how you've been using me
just like you use everybody else.
That was never part of the bargain.
Is it the hot flashes?
Get out.
Get out.
I'll see you back at the house.
I'm on my way to the office.
Let me call you when I get there.
No, no. We need to talk now.
I know you're upset, Peter,
but that's not going to achieve anything.
I am more than upset, Frank.
Change your tone. I'm in no mood.
  I don't give a fuck!   Good-bye, Peter.
You hang up on me now, you're not gonna appreciate who I call next.
  Excuse me?   I promised my people jobs.
You promised me you could get this bill passed.
You failed on your promise. I'm not gonna fail on mine.
So however you need to fix it, you figure it out.
Otherwise, I go public with Kapeniak and the Kern editorial.
You need to cool down
and think very carefully about what you just said.
You don't understand. I'm not afraid of you anymore, Frank.
Then you're misguided.
My past is out in the open.
You don't hold that over my head anymore.
They don't know everything, Peter.
You destroy me, you destroy yourself.
Fix it.
  What do you want me to do?   We have to accelerate things.
Isn't it too early?
It's almost two full months into the election.
That gives the White House too much time to vet somebody.
Peter's crossed the line.
We built up his confidence, and now we're losing control of him.
Maybe he was just blowing off steam.
No. He's determined. We have to act now.
You have everything you need on your end?
Give me a when and a where.
Some sort of social setting's preferable.
  Anything else?   I'll need cash.
About three grand.
It'll be in your top drawer by tomorrow morning.
Sir...
Once we do this, we're committed.
  Understood.   I can't predict how he's gonna react.
Well, I won't be blackmailed.
Hello?
Zoe Barnes?
Yeah. Who is it?
Claire Underwood.
Zoe?
I apologize for not buzzing.
Somebody was coming in the building when I was downstairs,
so I just figured...
This is nice... fire escape.
Hey, could you please not go through my things?
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I intruding?
Yeah, actually. You are.
Well, that makes it a two-way street, I suppose.
Okay, if you... if you came here to punish me...
Fine. I get it.
Such a shame,
how naive you are.
  I'm not naive.   No?
I've known everything from the beginning, Zoe.
My husband and I tell each other everything.
Don't you believe me?
Is there a spider I can trap?
I'm not here to punish you or to tell you to stop.
I just thought I should open those big bright eyes.
I think you should leave.
I think I should too.
Maybe you're not that naive.
A lesser woman wouldn't have opened the door.
Union Station, please.
This is Claire. I'm unavailable to answer the phone,
but if you leave a message,
I'll be sure and get back to you shortly.
Thank...
  Hello?   Zoe.
You don't have to tiptoe.
I thought you fell asleep.
No. Just thinking about work.
I don't have anything for you yet. I will soon.
I know you will.
You can spend the night if you want.
Early meetings.
Wouldn't have time to get home and change.
  You seem distracted.   I have a lot on my mind.
Like what?
  Work, just like you.   No Claire?
Or maybe she qualifies as work.
She didn't mention anything?
About...
I thought you didn't keep things from each other.
Look, just say what you want to say.
She came by here a few hours ago.
We had a nice little talk.
Don't let me keep you.
You should go home, get some rest.
Tell Claire I said hi.
This is Claire. I'm unavailable to answer...
The lights in the Whartons' house will go on in a few moments.
,
which is just the time that Claire would be going for her run,
if she were here.
Rebellion on all fronts...
Claire, Zoe, Russo.
I must not lose my resolve.
I will march forward,
even if I have to do so...
alone.
See? Told ya.
Good morning.
Hi, Frank.
  How are you?   I'm good.
  Have you heard from Claire?   Yeah, I got her message.
  How's she feeling?   A lot better.
Good. She said she'd be gone for the rest of the week.
  Is it the flu or something?   Something like that.
I just came over to pick up a few things from her office.
  I could've sent somebody over.   Oh, no. It's no big deal.
In fact, I also came here to ask you a favor.
You went to Stanford, correct?
  Valedictorian?   Yeah.
  Do you know the provost?   Warren Tynsdale.
He flies me out to do fund-raising events.
Supposedly I'm the poster child for alumni.
Making the world a better place.
Well, that is good, because this is important.
Linda Vasquez, the President's chief of staff...
her son, Ruben, applied.
I'd love for you to get on the phone with Tynsdale
and tell him that they should accept him.
I don't know. I... I've never recommended anyone.
All the better. It'll carry more weight.
Can I meet Ruben first?
I would really prefer that Linda not know.
In fact, it would be better if both she and Ruben
believed he got in on merit alone.
Will you please do this favor for Claire and me?
And for the President.
Thank you.
More contrast.
We need to catch the edge of his face.
Let's re-crop it. Bring it in a quarter of an inch on the left.
Would you...
Somebody named Claire?
Remy.
You hungry?
I don't eat pork.
When did that happen?
When we started lobbying for the meatpacking industry.
Freddy, half a rack for me,
and some Collard Greens for my friend here.
I'm good. I already ate lunch.
Half a rack coming up.
I don't usually do business here.
This is my little secret.
I'd love it if we could keep it that way.
I don't think you have to worry about me bringing clients by.
You seem tense, Remy.
I assume you're upset about the watershed bill.
Not with you. You were just doing your job.
But now I have to do mine.
I'd like to propose a partnership.
I'm always open to partnerships, Frank.
If Peter Russo were a pro-natural gas candidate,
how valuable would that be to Sancorp?
The watershed bill was anti-drilling.
Peter's pro-employment, not anti-drilling.
He just wants to bring employment to his people,
and Sancorp is building refineries.
Mostly on site.
Do you think they would be open
to considering Philadelphia?
I can talk with them, but I can't make any promises.
Oh, I don't want any promises. Just engage with Russo.
You know, give him a glimmer of good fortune.
Frank, here you go.
Come on. Smell that.
You sure you don't want to reconsider your stance on pork?
Brain food, brother.
  I love it.   .
You can afford that?
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
First and last month are taken care of.
So is the security deposit.
That's to buy some furniture.
I'll pay you back. I promise.
It's not necessary.
But I do need you to do one thing for me.
  I come across as a hypocrite.   You need jobs.
Do you really care how you deliver them?
First, I advocate for more regulation for the watershed,
then I cozy up to the drilling interests?
Yeah, but natural gas is the future, Peter.
This is an industry that could bring
I agree with Peter. It seems like flip-flopping.
Sancorp's lobbying efforts is why we lost the watershed bill.
But they can also be a very powerful ally.
Our message is a "Fresh start."
This makes you look like business as usual.
This is politics.
There are seized opportunities and missed opportunities.
Seize this one, Peter.
Sancorp can commit to building new refineries in Philly?
Sancorp will commit to discussing it with you.
  I need more than that.   Look, you asked me to fix a problem.
I've come to you in less than  hours with a solution.
Can you meet me halfway?
What would be the first step?
All right. You remember Remy Danton?
Oh, come on. He led the charge against the watershed bill.
I know. That's not the point.
One of his other big clients is the McNeally cancer institute.
They're having a big gala tonight...
a cocktail party... for their donors.
Remy will be there.
We have events in Haverford and Gladwyne...
Yeah, well, this is more important.
You also have a radio interview tomorrow morning
with a local Pittsburgh station?
  Yes.   All right.
Meet with Remy tonight.
And if it goes well and if you're comfortable,
tomorrow morning on the radio,
you support their drilling efforts.
And Remy has assured me if you do that,
he can push Sancorp in the right direction.
Cancel the events tomorrow.
Head back to Philly, do some damage control.
  I'll see you tomorrow afternoon.   Peter...
Please.
Okay.
I'm gonna go make some calls.
Peter, have you mentioned anything to her about Kapeniak or...
No. I haven't mentioned it to anybody.
All right. Stamper will come by in the morning
and brief you on the talking points.
When did you take this?
Oh, it was about : in the morning.
The sun had just come up.
You were asleep... right here.
The light was perfect.
I had no choice.
I always slept so well in this apartment.
How long are you in town for?
I don't know.
I haven't decided.
You have no luggage.
It smells the same.
Feels the same.
I think Sancorp is missing out,
not having a significant presence in Philadelphia.
There are advantages to centralizing in a major urban center.
But the disadvantages are commercial real estate prices,
city taxes, building a pipeline.
It's all very costly.
So they'd have to reduce costs elsewhere.
  Significantly.   How can I help with that?
Statewide permitted-use zoning.
No more conditional zoning.
The municipalities are slowing down development.
That's the state legislature.
You come out in support of permitted use,
and you get elected Governor.
That'll put pressure on the legislature.
Sancorp is very interested in having
a powerful friend in Harrisburg.
My opponent's pro-drilling.
Your opponent isn't asking for refineries in Philadelphia.
We prefer friends we can count on.
.
It's a Pittsburgh station.
It's been a pleasure, Congressman.
I look forward to talking again soon.
You got a light?
This is a cancer research event.
I know. I helped organize it.
  You work for the institute?   No. The hotel.
And they let you smoke here?
No. The manager would kill me.
Well, at least it got you talking.
Are you having a good night? You look happy.
Uh, I am. I am. I'm having a great night.
  Why?   I just got some very good news.
We should celebrate. What are you drinking?
You know, I was just leaving, actually.
You haven't even asked my name yet.
  I apologize, but I have to go.   It's Rachel.
I'm not trying to be rude, but I got a big meeting tomorrow.
Then don't be rude. Just stay a few more minutes
and keep me from having to mingle.
My date ditched me.
So if you abandon me now, that would be very rude.
These heels are killing me.
Feel that. Feel that blister.
Hey, I...I have a girlfriend.
I'd be surprised if you didn't.
Why'd your date ditch you?
Mmm. Very scandalous.
What happened?
Clink glasses with me.
I'm petite, but I can hold my liquor.
Obviously.
When I do get drunk, though...
What then?
I get undressed.
What about you?
What are you like when you get drunk?
  It's not pretty.   Pretty's overrated.
I like it when things get a little bit ugly.
When I work late nights,
they let me stay at the hotel
so I don't have to drive home.
This one is yours.
Room .
Sir?
In here.
You wanted to see me?
I need you to locate somebody.
Who?
My wife.
Do you have a way of doing that?
I do, sir.
I know a guy in missing persons...
She's not missing. I just...
don't know where she is at the moment.
I trust him.
We can do this off the books.
Good.
I'll get on it right away.
Come on. Give us another one.
No. I'll tell you why.
Because my mother always used to tell me to smile more.
Always drove me crazy. She'd say, "Claire",
"Why have you that scowl all the time?
You look so much more beautiful when you smile."
It was never a real conversation.
There was never, "Oh, what do you feel?"
Or "What are you thinking?"
Just so long as I looked beautiful and happy.
That's all she cared about.
So you want me to ask you
what you're thinking and feeling?
All the time.
I actually do wanna know what you're thinking and feeling.
  How sad am I?   Yes, so tell me first.
  What?   Tell me first.
  I think I'd better get dressed.   What? Why?
Uh, because...
I've got friends coming over,
and as a host, I should probably wear clothes.
  Really?   Yeah.
  Why do you do that?   Well, you know.
  It's proper?   Kind of.
Oh, fuck.
Thought you might have bailed.
Sit down.
Vodka or whiskey?
Uh, you go ahead.
Come on. You can be a good boy downstairs, not up here.
Seriously, I'm good.
Whiskey, I think.
So what's your good news?
I wanna know what we're celebrating.
Why did your, uh... why did your date ditch you?
  I asked you first.   I did, downstairs.
He works on the Hill.
Some staffer or something.
I don't know. I think he's a glorified gofer.
A friend set me up with him.
So I said he should come tonight, keep me company.
But all he wanted to do was schmooze.
So I brought him into the women's bathroom,
told him he was being an asshole.
He told me I was being childish.
So I slapped him.
You slapped him?
Yeah. Big red hand mark right across his face.
I think he was embarrassed to be seen by the Schmoozerati.
So he left.
And that is the last time
I go on a date with a guy who wears a flag pin to work.
I'm one of those guys who wears a flag pin to work.
This isn't really a date, is it?
I really shouldn't be here.
That's what makes it fun.
Tell me your good news. I wanna know what we're toasting to.
Let's toast to you.
I'm your good news? Okay, I'll toast to that.
What are you...
I didn't wanna wait at the Herald.
I was gonna call you, but...
Can I stay at your place tonight?
Uh, stay with me?
Well, just on your couch
for a night or two.
Uh, why?
I can't be in my apartment.
  Did something happen?   No. I...
I'm sorry.
Zoe.
Come on.
What time is the interview?
. I'll be with him.
And where's Peter now?
Are you sure you want the details?
Just tell me, is it going well?
Hasn't been any updates.
But if it does go well, you'll be ready?
I'm ready. I've been ready. I'm ready.
  Anything else?   We never played chess before, have we?
I don't know how.
You want me to teach you?
I should really get some rest.
Be fresh for the morning.
Yeah, another time.
Good night.
I hate being kept in the dark.
Waiting.
Speculating.
Useless.
Oh, come on! Let's dance.
It's not a big deal.
  Come on, let's do it.   No.
No, please, I can't. Not now.
Come on.
This is really nice.
Do you want anything? Water? Juice?
No, thanks. I'm good.
Uh, you can have the bed. I'll sleep on the couch.
No. No.
It's fine.
Please, Lucas, let me sleep on the couch.
I'll feel bad.
All right.
  Can I help?   I got it.
So,
you know, we don't have to talk if you don't want to.
But I haven't seen you in, like,
six months.
Except for when I drunkenly stalked you at your...
  Right.   That was kind of adorable.
It was either psychotic or sad.
Not adorable.
Yes, it was.
Can you hand me that pillow?
So, why do you need to get out of your apartment?
It just felt small.
Well, it can't be smaller than my place.
No. I don't mean size. I mean...
I felt trapped.
Like I was in a place that I didn't actually live.
Does that make any sense?
I guess.
Okay.
There you go.
Um, anytime you need to get up?
Um, I'll just set an alarm on my phone.
All right. Well, feel free to watch TV.
I can sleep through anything.
Hey, thank you, Lucas.
Hey, that's the last of it.
Better make it count, then.
Drink up.
Do I look familiar to you?
Familiar? No.
  My face? My body?   No.
How about my voice?
Have we...
No.
No. I was just wondering
if you had a thing for brunettes with blue eyes.
Hey, where you going? Come back here.
I wanna see you better.
Shit. The sun's up?
Has been for a while.
  Oh, fuck. What time is it?   :.
Fuck. I have an interview in half an hour.
  Skip it.   I can't. I gotta do it.
You can keep the room till noon.
  Hello?   I'm at your building.
The front desk keeps calling up, but there's no answer.
  I'm not there.   Then I'll come to you. Where are you?
I'm... I'm at the Park Highmore hotel.
Are you okay? You sound drunk.
It was, uh... yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm all right.
  You have the interview.   I know!
Have you been drinking, Peter?
Uh, what? No. Um, I just decided to spend the night here.
What room are you in?
Stay there. I'm coming right now.
Jesus, Peter. What happened? You're drunk.
  I'm fine.   I can smell it on you.
Okay, I had a drink or two.
It was nothing crazy.
We can't do this interview.
I'm sober. I can handle it.
You're slurring your words.
I'm good.
I think we should cancel.
I'm gonna do the interview.
Just give me the talking points.
Sorry.
Sorry. I...
It's all right.
The couch had a spring in it or something, and my back...
No.
It's all right.
I don't mind.
Sir, I heard from my friend.
Missing persons.
And?
  She's in New York.   What hotel?
Not a hotel, sir.
So she's not alone.
No, sir.
Adam Galloway?
Yes, sir.
I have more information.
I don't need to know.
Turn on  A.M.
He's running to fill Jim Matthews' old post as Governor of Pennsylvania.
Glad to have you with us, sir.
It's good to be here, Jim.
  It's mark.   Sorry. Right. Mark.
That's okay, Congressman.
It happens all the time this early in the morning.
So, Congressman, the watershed act.
Yes. Uh, I'm ashamed of the...
well, I'm not ashamed. That's not the right, um...
I'm disappointed, um, because, you know,
the water...
It's, um... it's... actually, what I'd like to discuss is...
we all know that natural gas...
that it's... it's a growing... uh, in our state...
it's a... it's a big part of, um...
economically, the way things are going.
And I'd like to say... to announce...
in terms of, um...
Are you familiar with drilling regulations...
permitted use versus conditional use?
Are we still talking about the watershed?
No. Drilling. Natural gas.
Sir, you supported increased regulation.
Well, no. I... I...
it may have looked that way, but, uh,
in fact, to be clear, I'm for less...
regulation.
Yes, sir.
In the watershed bill, the language clearly stated...
It didn't pass.
Well, right. That's what I'm asking about.
  What about it?   Why it didn't pass?
I just said.
No, sir. I don't think you did.
It just didn't.
Sir, three days ago, you predicted...
I'm talking about fucking natural gas.
I'm sorry.
Congressman, I have to ask you a question,
and it may come across as indelicate,
but are you drunk right now?
What? No. No. I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm just... I'm really tired, you know?
I've been on the campaign trail for a few weeks now,
Congressman?
Congressman? Congressman?
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have let you.
I'm fucked.
Okay. Listen. We sober you up.
We'll make some kind of announcement as soon as possible.
There's nothing I can say.
We'll figure this out.
Come on.
You're gonna take a shower.
Come on.
There you go. Come on.
How bad is it?
It all depends on whether
it gets picked up by the mainstream press.
  Well, shall I fill in the president?   No. Hold off on that.
I need to speak to Peter, coordinate with his campaign.
You'll be the first call I make.
Frank, before you go,
I got an e-mail this morning.
Stanford reversed their decision.
That's wonderful.
The Provo said Gillian Cole reached out to him.
I googled her. She works for Claire.
  Thank you.   No reason to thank me.
Ruben was just ecstatic.
I don't know how I'm gonna repay you.
The fact that your son is happy is more than enough.
  You'll keep me posted on Peter?   You bet.
Okay.
Hey, boss.
  Are you still with him?   Yeah.
  He's taking a shower.   How're we looking?
Zoe Barnes posted ten minutes ago.
It's already on the New York times web site.
The kid is done.
Have Nancy set up a meeting with the Vice President.
  Today if possible.   Will do.
And keep an eye on Peter. He's done his duty.
  Let's get him back on his feet.   You got it.
And now Jim Matthews comes to the fore,
though he doesn't know it yet.
He will find solace in his beloved Pennsylvania,
though Peter Russo will find solace nowhere.
It only takes ten seconds to crush a man's ambitions.
I need to take care that I protect mine.
Peter.
Peter!
Peter?House.of.Cards.SE
This is Russo. Please leave a message.
He's not answering my calls.
It's over, and he must know it.
You don't think there's any way he can recover?
The Republicans will play that interview
on every radio and television station
from now until November th.,
I sympathize with the kid,
but this was my concern from the beginning.
And I should've listened to you, sir.
I thought he could handle the pressure.
Okay. So he withdraws.
We need to replace him.
You have any ideas?
With less than two months to go?
If the President hadn't shut me out of the early discussions,
I could've come up with some good options,
but I don't know anyone
who's got the name recognition and donor base
to start a campaign from scratch just seven weeks out.
Let me think.
Everything hinges on the next few minutes...
all my months of planning, every move I've made.
  There is one person.   Who?
You, Mr. Vice President.
If you ran to reclaim your seat,
I think you'd win by a landslide.
Resign the vice presidency.
Only if you win.
Walker needs me for .
Are you entirely certain he's gonna keep you on the ticket?
I mean, it's no secret the two of you don't exactly get along.
What has he said?
Oh, you're putting me in a very awkward position, Mr. Vice President.
Has he been bad-mouthing me?
Well, the exact phrase he used was
"Pain in the ass."
That fucker.
He's got no idea how to lead,
no sense of respect.
  Oh, is this his idea?   No.
  His way of getting rid of me?   No. It struck me yesterday,
and I just thought it was worth suggesting.
But, no, I haven't discussed this with anyone.
And you shouldn't.
People don't leave the White House to become a governor.
May I ask you a personal question, sir?
Do you want to be the Vice President?
Peter said that when you were out on that campaign trail,
you had so much enthusiasm and energy
that he thought you maybe missed being the Governor.
I do miss it.
Then why not go back?
You could be the hero of this election
and secure Pennsylvania for the Democrats in .
Garrett would never go along with something like this,
even if he hates my guts.
It would make him look weak,
like he's lost control of the administration.
Not if it was a mutual decision.
Look, let me talk to Garrett.
I won't mention that we've spoken.
I suppose there's no harm in finding out what he thinks.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
  Slogans for .   ". He's making us proud again."
  D.J.   Who is Carter.
  No. John.   Who is Ford.
Peter?
Slogans for .
". Grandfather's hat fits Ben."
Peter, are you here?
  Claudia.   Who is Benjamin Harrison.
  Yes.   Presidential slogans for .
". The full dinner pail "
On the train ride down,
I almost called the police to have them break in
and make sure you hadn't hurt yourself.
I'm not gonna even ask you what happened.
It doesn't matter right now.
What matters right now...
  What matters...   Who is Goldwater.
  Claudia   Who is Goldwater.
Barry Goldwater. Yes.
Oh, come on. Hey, I'm watching that.
What matters is the  reporters in front of your building
and the  campaign staffers
who don't know if they still have a job.
It's over.
I know.
So, tell them to go away.
What, are you just gonna hole yourself up in here
and hope it all goes away?
Yeah, that's pretty much the plan.
Well, I won't let you.
Hey, put that down. Hey.
  Hey, put that down!   Peter...
We need to put out a statement.
Call me when you're prepared to do that.
I'll be at the headquarters in Philly.
I was scared that I was starting to feel too much for you.
I think that's why I ended it.
And you have no room for fear?
No. Being afraid doesn't accomplish anything.
That's not true. When I'm overseas,
rational fear... disease or violence...
that sort of fear keeps you alive.
Back here, God,
I find myself afraid of things
that I can't name or point to.
It's like, uh, how little am I seeing?
Or have I wasted this day or this moment?
Yeah, I think that sometimes...
whether my life will add up.
Francis would roll his eyes
if he heard me talking like this.
Does he know where you are?
No, he doesn't.
If he's looking for you, that's where you are.
Over there.
Before you met Frank.
Alone.
Curious.
Absorbing everything.
You have no idea what I was like when I was a girl.
Did he ever know that side of you?
He wasn't interested in that girl.
And neither was I.
What were you interested in?
Being more than an observer.
You wanted to be seen.
Not just seen.
I wanted to be significant.
There's no historical precedent.
Aaron Burr ran for Governor,
Calhoun for the Senate.
One shot a man in a duel, the other believed in slavery.,
Is that really the sort of company we wanna share, Frank?
Mr. President, we stand losing
control of an important swing state,
our majority in the house,
and quite possibly your second term in office.
Preventing all of that may require unconventional measures.
It would look like I'm pushing him out.
Or worse... that he's abandoning the administration.
You make a joint statement.
You say he won't resign unless he wins.
If he loses, he stays on as Vice President.
No one could accuse either of you of disloyalty to the other.
Did Jim come to you with this?
No. It's entirely my idea.
I wouldn't dream of speaking to
the Vice President without passing it by you first.
I think he'd take it as an affront,
like I'm trying to get rid of him.
Honestly, sir, I think
he might be more interested than you imagine.
  Why is that?   Well, I hesitate to bring this up,
but when he was campaigning for Russo,
he spoke quite freely about you, sir.
Tell me.
Of course, I'm getting this secondhand from Peter,
but the gist of it is that...
that you lack entirely in leadership,
and that you have no sense of respect.
And he wants more responsibility.
And how do I give him that when he shows
absolutely no discretion, no discipline?
Well, that is entirely my point. Now, look,
I take full responsibility for backing Russo,
but there could be a silver lining in all this.

Secure Pennsylvania for the Democrats
and find an honorable way to replace Matthews.
What do you think?
I think it is a very big decision,
and we do not want to make it impulsively.
I agree. I'd like to put some more thought into it.
Well, that is very prudent, sir. Just bear in mind,
seven weeks out, that every day counts.
  Hi, sir.   How much is it?
Oh, I got your receipt right here.
No, no, no. It was... it was just  .
Yeah. Don't tell anyone, all right?
No. I... I never say anything about our tenants.
  The press still outside?   Yeah.
I told them you weren't here, like you said.
Most of them left. There's still, you know, a few, though.
If I wanted to leave,
is there a place I could do it without being seen?
Yeah. The freight elevator down to the garage.
I could call you a cab or...
All right. Thanks. I'll let you know.
Mr. Russo, uh...
sir, it's none of my business,but, uh,
my uncle... he fell off the wagon a few times.
When he did, the best thing for him was just not to be alone.
I'll give you this money back, I'll take that bag off your hands,
come in here, keep you company...
I appreciate it. I'll let you know if I change my mind.
Sit down.
Where's Claire?
Not here.
So what is this, tying up loose ends?
I wouldn't presume.
People like you can't be neatly tied up.
But I thought perhaps we could start...
It's very tasteful.
This is the dress she wore to the gala.
I believe so.
It is.
I recognize it.
Go back into the bedroom.
I'm amazed how well you got her in focus.
What should we call her?
Why does she need a name?
I never photograph anyone without knowing their name.
You didn't take the photograph. I did.
I think we should call her Claire.
She doesn't even look like me.
Not even a younger version. Why do you keep saying that?
Not her features, her expression.
Hey, we should mount it. You can hang her in your house.
Would Francis object?
Can we please not discuss Francis?
You brought him up in the park.
I know I did, and I shouldn't have.
So we have to pretend he doesn't exist?
I thought we could talk about anything.
He is a presence here. You must admit that.
When you walked through the door yesterday,
he walked right in with you.
It's just me, nobody else.
You keep telling yourself that, it might come true.
How do you think she'd feel if she knew I was wearing this?
I don't know.
You don't think she'd be upset?
She'd probably say you look very beautiful in it.
It's like steel.
You should put it back.
I think I'll keep it.
I'll buy you one of your own, if you'd like.
No. I want this one.
She came into my bedroom.
She should know I came into hers.
Is your bed always so perfectly made?
It's a habit I formed at military school.
What side of the bed does she sleep on?
That side.
She can keep it.
Fits her better anyway.
Listen, Zoe...
Whatever just happened upstairs,
whatever these past six months have been,
can we agree that it is time to simplify?
What does simple look like?
We maintain our professional arrangement, as you suggested,
which I will honor.
You still trust me?
What choice do I have?
You didn't hurt me or discard me like you said you would.
I'm glad I didn't have to.
Yes, we'll agree to simplify.
Good.
Sorry I'm a few minutes late, Frank.
Please, have a seat.
I have a pretty good idea why you asked for this meeting.
  Have you and the President had a chance to speak?   We have.
  Is he leaning one way or another?   He's torn.
  And what about you?   I'm a little less torn.
My instincts tell me it's a mistake.
You wanna convince me otherwise?
Well, look, if your instincts tell you
this is not the way to go, I'm not about to...
Frank, I'm gonna ask you two very direct questions,
and I would appreciate direct answers.
When you got my son into college,
were you anticipating a moment like this?
I don't follow.
Honestly, Frank?
Was I antici...
I would be happy to answer you directly
if I knew what you were asking.
All right. I will ask you my second question.
Do you want the Vice Presidency for yourself?
I would serve at the pleasure of the President. That was his...
You proposed this idea so that you can take Matthews' place.
  I did not say that.   But it is what you want.
  What I want is in the...   The President makes you V.P.,
he keeps you on the ticket in ,
and you use that as a springboard to run in .
Tell me that trajectory has never entered your mind.
Well, Linda, I make a habit of
considering all trajectories in any given situation.
But that's a practical exercise, not a personal one.
So you refuse to admit it.
Admit it's what I want? That's irrelevant.
You're the one who asked for this meeting, not me.
This meeting's about trying to solve a problem,
not fulfill some personal ambition.
But if both could be achieved, you wouldn't object.
I think this is a sound course of action
regardless of who the President taps to replace Matthews.
I must gamble everything I have right now.
If I'm honest, she may use it against me.
If I'm not, she won't lift a finger.
I've used the same tactic myself.
Once someone is exposed,
they're at your mercy.
She wants to hear me say the words.
Yes.
I want to be the Vice President.
And, yes, I helped your son get into college
in the hopes that you would return the favor.
But I can't force you to do so, Linda.
But I also think that we would make a formidable team.
Look what we've been able to accomplish
even when we've been at odds with each other.
Now put your mind to what we could accomplish if we weren't.
Thank you for taking the time, Linda.
I'll call you back. How'd it go?
She's holding her cards very close to the chest.
  Any word from Peter?   Nothing.
Christina said he wouldn't leave the apartment.
But I called the doorman, and he said that Peter was gone.
  Where?   He doesn't know.
He needs to officially withdraw to put pressure on Walker.
I'm trying to track him down.
Why'd you let him out of your sight in the first place?
I thought he was showering.
He disappeared when I was on the phone with you.
There was a plan here, Doug.
He explodes, he withdraws,
we put him back together, and he quietly goes away.
Russo has made no public appearances
since allegations that he was inebriated
during a radio interview on WZPZ Pittsburgh yesterday morning.
Sources among the Democratic leadership have suggested
that the party is currently considering options to replace Russo.
Meanwhile, Republican candidate Jack Swofford's lead
has jumped to a  point margin,
according to an overnight CNN poll of registered voters.
The Swofford campaign
is also reporting a sharp spike in contributions...
nearly half a million dollars in the last ...
I saw that this morning.
Francis got Peter to run.
Do you know him well?
We weren't close.
Do you need to make calls?
  'Cause I can head into the other room.   I don't think so.
Thanks.
Where are you going?
To the lab. I should've gone in today.
Adam.
  Adam...   Just go. Go. Leave.
How long do you think this can possibly go on for?
We have never spent more than  hours together.
Maybe there's a reason for that.
A part of me still loves you.
Which part?
I can't be just a pit stop, Claire,
  or some sort of escape...   Oh, come on.
  You're more than that.   ... or a top-up on
  whatever Francis can't provide.   Oh, fuck off!
He's my husband, Adam.
We've gone through more than you could ever imagine.
I envy your free spirit, and I'm attracted to it,
but not all of us have that luxury.
Which is what I find so frustrating about you, Claire.
You... you had a choice.
You chose not to be free.
No. What I chose was a man I could love for more than a week.
I shouldn't have said that. I...
At least you're being honest.
I can't live moment to moment like you, Adam.
I have a history with Francis, I have a future with him,
and it's bigger than a moment.
Then you should kill it...
whatever part of you still loves me.
If you can't,
I will.
  Adam...   No.
  Hello?   Hey. Hey, sweetie.
How's it going? I'm... are you with your mom?
She's downstairs. You want me to go get her?
No. No. I just wanted to call and say,
you know, hey to your... uh, your brother and you.
Is he... is he there?
He's in his room, I think.
Okay. You wanna go get him?
Hold on.
He says he doesn't want to talk to you.
What?
Why not?
We've seen the news, dad.
There were all sorts of TV cameras at our school yesterday.
Mom's making us stay home this week.
I want you to do something. I want you to go to, uh,
your bedroom window and look out.
You see that black car?
  Yeah.   That's me.
You shouldn't be here, dad. Mom would be really angry.
Well, we don't need to tell her. Right?
It'll just be... it'll just be, uh...
it'll just be our little secret.
Your voice sounds weird,
like it did on the radio.
You... you heard that?
I have a computer.
I'm sorry.
I...sometimes your dad makes mistakes.
  I better go.   No.
I don't like to hear your voice when it's like this.
It makes me sad. Bye, dad.
Sarah, please...
Peter?
Christina.
Where are you?
I'm, uh...
I'm not... I'm not... I'm not doing so well.
Where are you, Peter?
  I'm in my car.   Are you driving?
No.
Tell me where you are.
I'm outside my kids' house.
  You mean Madeleine's?   Yeah.
I need you to stay right there.
Okay, Peter?
You'll stay there?
Peter.
Peter, are you still there?
Hello?
Hello?
I'd like to turn myself in.
For what?
A few months ago,
I was pulled over for drunk driving.
They let me go. I should've been convicted.
Well, if you were let go, sir,
we can't arrest you for it now.
Well, I drunk drove here. Arrest me for that.
We can put you in a detox tank...
I wanna be formally arrested.
My name is Congressman Peter Russo.
I was arrested in January on Michigan Avenue.
Please have a seat, Congressman.
I gotta make a few phone calls.
Have you found him?
I'm in front of his ex-wife's house.
Christina said he called from there.
  He's not there?   No.
But his phone is. I found it by the curb.
So we have no way to contact him?
Not unless he reaches out to us.
This isn't good.
Want me to alert the authorities?
Let's give him a little longer.
  How long did it last?   About six months.
  He was older.   A lot?
Yeah.
Was he a journalist, or did he work on The Hill?
I'd rather not say.
All right.
He was someone I looked up to... for a while.
Why did it end?
He has a wife.
We both knew it was gonna end eventually.
I mean, it was really...
it was fucked up.
The first night we spent together,
he told me he was gonna hurt me and then discard me.
And when it ended, I told him that he'd done neither.
But...
it does hurt.
I won't hurt you.
Yeah, you can't promise me that.
Yes, I can.
  Has anyone else seen him?   No.
He's in an interrogation room by himself.
I never should've got mixed up with this fucking mess.
We're way behind regret time, Barney.
Just have your guys keep him out of sight.
I'll need a back exit.
  I got him. Thanks.   Yeah.
Come on.
Hey, Peter.
Where's your car?
It's down the street.
I'll drive you home.
You go back to mine, have Meechum let you in.
  This way?   Yeah.
What were you thinking, Peter?
I need to take responsibility for my actions.
By getting yourself thrown in jail?
Real responsibility.
Like... like they talk about in the meetings,
not the lies we told for the campaign.
What you just did was extremely reckless.
I don't care.
I'm making a statement tomorrow, Frank.
About pulling out of the race?
That's not enough. I...
I need to stop hiding.
Well, let's work together on the language.
I have to do it on my own. It's gotta be my own words.
Look, Peter, this isn't just about you anymore, all right?
  Let me help you.   I don't want your help.
I didn't never ask your help when you... I got arrested.
When did your help ever help me?
You can live your life the way you want to.
I'm done being told how to live mine.
Well, there has to be a way to take responsibility without
shattering everything.
Are you at least willing to have that discussion?
  Do you want me to come upstairs?   No.
I know you're in a lot of pain, Peter.
But I don't want you to feel any pain tonight.
Here. You can start fresh tomorrow.
Go ahead. I won't judge you. Hell, I'll even join you.
Just relax.
You're home now.
Whatever it is you have to face tomorrow,
you don't have to face it now.
Right now it's just you and me.
The rest of the world doesn't matter.
Your children, Christina...
they will forgive you,
because you're loved, Peter.
Failed.
I failed myself.
I failed my family.
I failed the campaign.
No, you haven't, Peter.
May I?
You know, when Claire and I were first married,
we talked about having children.
I told her flat out I didn't want any.
It was selfish but honest.
I didn't have a particularly happy childhood.
I suspect you didn't either.
No.
You see, no person avoids pain.
And I just didn't think it was right to bring a child in knowing that.
But now when I think back, I...
I realize that was cowardly.
I see you,
and I think, well, there's a brave man,
far braver than me.
I'm so tired.
When I... when I think about... when I...
I'm so tired.
You should close your eyes.
Let it all go.
We have all the time in the world.
Peter?
Peter.
I walked back.
Whatever happens in the next few hours,
whatever you hear,
we will never speak of it.
Sir...
I heard from Linda about a half an hour ago.
The President wants to meet with you.
About what?
I don't know.
Frank.
Now, when you brought up this idea, I wasn't sold.
It struck me as both desperate and careless.
But then Linda laid out all the pros,
and they clearly outweigh the cons.
I explained our reasoning to Jim
and hoped he wouldn't think I was off my rocker.
I did at first,
but the President made some very good arguments.
It's a bold move, Frank.
I'm very impressed.
Well, thank you, sir, for being open to the idea.
And thank you, Mr. President, for taking the risk.
We'll need to work this out step by step.
The execution has to be perfect.
Where are things with Russo? Any word from him yet?
We're still trying to locate him.
  Well, is there any cause for worry?   It's been two days.
I am a bit worried, I have to admit.
I mean, this must be an extremely difficult moment for him.
We're hoping he'll reach out shortly.
Let's get our people on it. I wanna know where he is.
Now, once he withdraws, we have to move quickly.
We'll make a joint statement, as you proposed.
It's a clear message, I think.
Pennsylvanians matter to us,
and we're not gonna let them down.
That's right.
I'll say that Jim's an invaluable asset to the White House,
but that I have great admiration for the sacrifice
he's willing to make for the people of his home state.
And you should not accept his resignation until he's elected.
That will show your continuing commitment to him.
I think that's a good idea.
As long as I can devote myself wholly to the campaign, I agree.
Now, should Jim win,
we'll need to nominate a Vice President immediately.
Linda, you're putting together a list of names?
Yes. And you can begin the vetting process
as soon as you narrow down the choices.
I already have a short list of top contenders.
I want your input on that, Jim.
More than happy.
Congressman?
Congressman?
We can use the existing infrastructure.
Are you okay with Nash Aarons?
I like Nash, but I'll want to bring in some of my own people.
Well, that won't be a problem. Nash is a team player.
And we can reallocate some of your
  existing  reelection funds...   Excuse me. Linda.
Peter Russo is dead.
Suicide.
He was found in his garage with the car still running.
I'm so sorry, Frank.
  May I have a moment, sir?   Of course.
I will get more information and start drafting a statement.
Let's reschedule. Whenever is best for Frank.
Congressman Peter Russo was found dead
early this morning in the parking garage...
why didn't we break this?
of his apartment building in Washington D.C.
U.S. Secret Service Agents discovered his body after reports
that Russo had been missing since Saturday.
Fuck!
His body was transferred to the D.C. Coroner's office
where an autopsy is expected to confirm his death as a suicide.
A junior congressman from Philadelphia...
Zoe.
Russo was  years old
Look at this.
And is survived by two children.
I gotta get to the office.
Russo was in the midst of a heated battle
for the governorship of Pennsylvania.
He was last heard publicly during a morning political radio show
on Pittsburgh station WZPZ.
Now, during the interview,
he slurred his words,
he sounded disoriented leading many to believe
Christina.
that he had relapsed...
Can you get me a train back to D.C.?
Right here on this TV station for all
the late-breaking details about this major news story:
the suicide of congressman Peter Russo.
I find it very difficult to
express everything that I'm feeling right now,
and I know Claire feels exactly the same.
Peter was very special to us.
A sort of magnetic presence
that electrified everyone he touched.
My husband and I became very close to him in the past several month.
Peter was more than a college, more than a friend.
He was family.
Our hearts go out to his children and his mother.
To all of those who knew him
and worked with him and loved him.
We would ask that all of you respect their privacy,
and honor their lost.
Today is indeed a sad day for the United States' Congress,
for the state of Pennsylvania,
and for all of us.
Thank you very much.House.of.Cards.SE
Hey. Excuse me.
I'm Paul Capra. I'm here to see Christina.
Oh, right this way, Mr. Capra. She's expecting you.
  Paul. Hi.   Hey, Christina.
  It's good to see you.   Yeah, you too.
Can I get you anything?
Nah. I grabbed some breakfast on the way down.
  Okay. Have a seat.   All right. Thank you.
I asked you down here
because I spoke to D triple C
and the D.N.C.
We'd like you to run for Peter's seat.
As you probably know,
the election's been set for the first week of February.
You want me to run?
With your stature in the community,
your grass roots organizing experience...
Christina, hold on.
I know it's a lot to consider.
It's only been a month.
Well, we still have to govern, Paul.
I thought you asked me down here
because you wanted to talk or something.
I do. About the election.
I mean about Peter.
How come you didn't go to the funeral?
I couldn't.
How you been holding up?
I'm all right. It's been hard keeping the office on track.
Jesus. Screw the office.
What about you?
You're allowed to grieve, Christina.
Paul...
there are , people counting on us.
I can't let my feelings get in the way of that.
Will you hear me out about running for Peter's seat?
Well, you've passed the vetting process with flying colors.
  Is there anything we might have missed?   No, sir.
Tell me about your
experience as the chair of the oversight reform committee.
It's been very rewarding.
What are the biggest challenges you've had to face?
Partisanship.
Well, I suppose a room filled with  big egos
isn't the most hospitable place for oversight.
Do you want to be Vice President, Tabitha?
It would be a great honor, sir.
We'll be in touch.
That's all?
  For the time being.   Thank you, Mr. President.
We have to cross her off.
I agree. She could put a crack addict to sleep.
Then what is she doing on the goddamn list?
Tabitha's a very gifted legislator.
I don't want people who make sense on paper.
I need at least one viable option.
The two of you created this list and
have proceeded to cross off every name you've put on it.
It's just a first pass, sir.
We need time to fully vet all...
Jim is gonna win this thing in Pennsylvania,
and we're no closer to naming his replacement
than we were a month ago.
Let us take another crack at it
and give you a few more names to consider.
I just want one name.
We'll have something for you by tomorrow morning.
Thank you, Mr. President.
He's ready to say yes to anything.
Yeah, for this to work, I don't think you can be there.
  Not when I first mention it.   I agree.
You bring it up in your morning brief,
and when I show up, I'll act surprised.
Assuming he's open to the idea...
Look, all we have to do tomorrow is plant the notion in his head.
I'm sure you'll be persuasive.
  Hello?   Mr. Capra?
Yeah. Who's this?
Janine Skorsky from Slugline.
We spoke when I wrote the piece about Congressman Russo's passing.
I'm done giving interviews about Peter, okay?
He was a troubled guy. End of story.
This is not about his death.
I'm calling you because
my sources at the D Triple C are telling me
that you might be running for his seat.
I'm not talking about that.
But you did have a meeting
this morning with Christina Gallagher, correct?
I'm driving right now. I really shouldn't be on the phone.
If you do run, I would like to know
about your involvement in the closing of
the Philadelphia shipyard.
That decision was made in Washington.
The association wasn't consulted.
Forgive me. I find that hard to believe.
I read all of the transcripts from the BRAC Commission.
Congressman Russo didn't give any testimony.
So are you saying that
he didn't consult with you once before you...
Somebody was strong-arming him, okay? It was politics.
Do you know who would've pressured him?
Look, I don't know. He just said people up the food chain.
Did he say anything more specific about...
You know what? There's traffic. I gotta go.
Mr. Capra, I would...
Should I be prepared to do press?
If he's amenable.
What do you think our chances are?
Better than  , if I had to say.
We won't announce until after Matthews wins, though.
I hate to admit it, but I'm nervous.
So am I.
It's just the last time, we found ourselves...
That's my fear too.
All right. You call me, either way.
In no more than nine hours.
Linda's been in there far too long.
If the President takes this much convincing,
it doesn't bode well. I can feel it...
his hesitation on the other side of that door.
I know it's pointless to worry
until I know what cards I'm holding.
Perhaps he just got interrupted by some...
He wants to tap Raymond Tusk.
  What?   He thinks it's a bold idea.
It's an idiotic idea. The man's never held public office.
That's one of the things the President said he likes about him.
The President wants to nominate
a multibillionaire in a struggling economy?
He'll alienate half the country.
Which is exactly what I said,
but he made it very clear
he does not want me to fight him on this.
  So you didn't mention me at all?   I never had the chance.
His mind was made up before I could say a word.
Well, we have to unmake it.
Well, you can try, but if you do,
my guess is he's gonna cut you out of the process altogether.
He seemed adamant.
We should go in there.
  Mr. President.   Morning, Frank.
Will you give us a few minutes, Linda?
Of course.
Linda fill you in?
I think Raymond Tusk
is an exciting, bold idea.
Well, I'm glad you agree. Linda didn't think so.
He's a proven businessman. Brilliant, but down-to-earth.
Do you know him personally?
I met him briefly once at a fund-raiser.
Last night when I called him
was the first time we had a meaningful conversation.
Did he seem open to the idea?
I sensed a good deal of reluctance.
He wanted a few days to consider.
Well, good. That gives us time to start vetting him.
He's clean. I had him vetted last year
when I was considering him for Secretary of the Treasury.
And did he say why he's reluctant?
No. Didn't give a reason. Just wanted to mull it over.
I want to send someone to St. Louis to speak to him in person,
convince him to accept the nomination.
And who are you thinking about?
I'd send Linda, but there's so much work for her to do here,
and, well, she can be abrasive at times.
Yeah, she can be a bit tough.
I want someone with gravitas.
Birch is a possibility,
but he's not always been our strongest ally.
I'm not sure I would trust Bob with something like this.
I would be happy to go myself, sir.
I can use a light touch and give him the respect he deserves.
Good. I'll let his people know you're coming.
  Thank you, Mr. President.   Thank you, Frank.
Tell me, Francis.
It's good we were prepared for anything.
I have to fly to St. Louis tonight.
"Somebody was strong-arming him."
and when I asked him who, he said, quote,
  "People up the food chain."   It's Washington.
Congressmen get strong-armed all the time.
My gut says it was Frank Underwood.
He had nothing to do with Russo before the shipyard closing,
and then suddenly he's propping him up?
That doesn't mean he was...
Let's cut the bullshit once and for all, Zoe.
I know he's been feeding you your stories.
I don't want to screw you over,
but I'm not gonna stop digging on this.
I won't say he was a source.
But you do know each other.
Show me your notes, and I'll talk to him.
These are the notes from the Capra call.
And these are the transcripts from the BRAC hearing.
When they got to the Philadelphia shipyard,
Russo doesn't say anything.
That's fine.
Yeah, I would just put both of them in that file.
Claire, I just got a call from the P.R. office at Sancorp
saying they wanted to send a film crew
to take footage of our filtration project in Botswana.
Right. They're just using that for promotional material.
Sancorp fought us on the watershed bill.
They helped us get the filters out of South Sudan.
I thought that was the State Department.
No. You remember Remy Danton?
You met him in your office right after you started working here.
  The lobbyist.   I asked him for his help.
We're just returning the favor, that's all.
Claire, they're against everything we stand for.
It's harmless. They'll send the video
to a few of their investors and make some commercials.
This makes me very uncomfortable... the idea...
They are sending the film crew, Gillian,
so please work with them on that.
One of my colleagues is looking into Peter Russo.
The assumption is you strong-armed him into closing the shipyard.
Where does your colleague get their information?
I don't know.
Allocating the D.O.D. budget is always a free-for-all.
Did you pressure him?
There were certain people that were gonna benefit
from the base closing sooner rather than later.
I didn't strong-arm Peter.
I advised him to trade in a losing hand for a winning one.
How did he stand to win?
He made allies out of enemies.
That's a very valuable thing in Congress.
I wish I could give you something juicier,
but the shipyard closing was just politics as usual.
I assume your colleague is Ms. Skorsky.
Does she know we're talking?
No. Of course not.
Be in touch.
More than you ever wanted to know about Raymond Alan Tusk...
the companies he controls, political contributions.
A GQ article entitled "Backwoods billionaire"
  is about his humble midwestern lifestyle.   Jesus.
There's also a copy of the financial disclosure requirements
and details of the blind trust.
I think the trust is where you want to focus.
Could Linda be behind all this?
To what end?
To get you out of town for a few days
while they continue the search without your interference.
The President has no reason to mistrust me.
Unless Linda told him you want the Vice Presidency.
No. She's in way too deep.
We misjudged her on the Secretary of State nomination.
That was different. She blindsided me.
Now she knows my eyes are wide open.
Do you want the Gaffney bag or regular business?
Regular business. Tusk can dress down if he wants to,
but I'm representing the White House.
Oh, and get Walter Doyle onto Tusk.
Let's see if we can dig up anything.
I'll call him right now.
And keep your eye on Janine Skorsky while I'm away.
She's been prying into Russo.
What does she know?
She knows the right questions to ask.
I want to make sure she doesn't get the right answers.
I'm on it.
McCuddin.
McCuddin.
What was that?
McCuddin Air Force Base.
BRAC hearing. Was there on April th.
David Rasmussen stepped down less than a week later.
Womack takes his place. So maybe...
Wait. Slow down.
McCudden is in his district.
Is that the shipyard thing?
Janine, call me back.
I think it was Womack who pressured Russo.
Russo was probably just earning a favor
he could cash in later.
I'm around.
Did you ever have to fight her to kill a story?
Janine?
Yeah. When she worked for you.
Only when I knew she was wrong.
She's trying to draw up this whole conspiracy thing
with Russo and Frank Underwood
and the whole shipyard closing.
But I'm pretty sure she's wrong.
  Pretty sure isn't the same as certain.   No. I am certain.
   How do you know?   I have sources.
  Underwood?   No.
No. Never mind. I'll figure it out.
  Mrs. Tusk?   Jean, please.
You must be Frank. Come in.
So nice to meet you.
The guest room is this way.
It is very kind of you to have invited me to stay here.
Why waste the taxpayers' money on a hotel
when we have a perfectly good bed?
Well, both they and I are very grateful.
I'm sorry Raymond isn't awake to greet you.
  He goes to bed at...   I know he's an early riser.
I understand.
Would you like a wake-up knock?
No. I have an alarm on my phone.
  Sleep tight.   Thank you so much.
I would say good morning, but it's the middle of the night.
  It's a pleasure to meet you.   And you too.
Was I making too much noise?
No. I smelled bacon.
Here.
Coffee? Booze?
Just water for now.
It's filtered. Your wife would approve.
You ever been to St. Louis before?
Just the airport.
What do you think so far?
Well, I've only seen your neighborhood
and whatever I could see out the window on the interstate.
Good enough. It's all pretty much the same.
Excuse me.
Listen, um, I still haven't showered.
My mind is on China here.
Uh, what do you say you get a few more zs
and we try this again in a few hours with our clothes on?
Sounds like a plan.
.
I'll have a driver pick you up.
Can I ask why you do that?
  Do what?   Tap your ring like that.
I've seen you do it on TV.
Two taps every time you get up from a table or leave a lectern.
Something my father taught me.
It's meant to harden your knuckles
so you don't break them if you get into a fight.
It also has the added benefit of knocking on wood.
My father believed that success
is a mixture of preparation and luck.
Tapping the table kills both birds with one stone.
Your father was a peach farmer?
Yes, he was. Not a very successful one.
  Lack of preparation or lack of luck?   Lack of both.
He was better at giving advice than following it.
Miss? Miss, your card.
Thank you.
Ms. Gallagher, my name's Janine Skorsky.
I'm a reporter at Slugline.
  I wrote the profile on Congressman...   I remember.
  Do you have a minute?   If this is about Peter, I...
No. It's about Paul Capra.
We know that he might be running for Congressman Russo's old seat.
I can't comment on that.
We're just trying to do some background
on the shipyard closing last April.
Listen, I just want to eat my breakfast.
We have sources that are saying
that the Congressman was being pressured by someone
to not fight the closure.
  Who?   That's what I'm trying to figure out.
This is completely off the record, I promise you.
  Hi, Christina.   Doug, hi.
  How you holding up?   I'm okay.
I'm... I'm good.
I saw you sitting over here. You mind if I...
No. Please.
Ms. Skorsky, right?
I believe we spoke a few times when you used to work at the Herald.
Whenever I could get past the press office gauntlet to you.
We do like to run a tight ship.
So what brings you to the Capitol?
I was just asking Ms. Gallagher
who's running to fill the vacant seat in Pennsylvania's st.
Well, the honest answer is we don't know.
Thank you for your time, Ms. Gallagher.
Anyone starts harassing you with questions you don't want to answer,
you let me know.
I'll handle them.
You got enough on your plate right now.
Thanks, Doug. I appreciate that.
Hang in there, okay?
Yes.
Uganda,
Peru,
Nepal,
Indonesia...
Nicaragua.
Well, you are quite the well traveled man.
No. I'm the man who stays at home.
Jean brought those back for me.
  Mr. Tusk, I am...   First names.
After all, we have broken bacon together.
We can safely assume that we're familiar.
Raymond, I realize that you are a very busy man,
so I'm gonna cut right to the chase.
The President sincerely would like you
to become the next Vice President.
That part I already knew.
And I'm here to convince you to say yes.
Another thing I already knew.
Well, I don't know that
I can tell you anything you don't already know.
But perhaps you can tell me what your hesitation is.
Speak.
Yes.
Now, I understand you might have some concerns
about the financial disclosures leading...
Speak.
No.
I have eight people representing me at eight
simultaneous meetings in six time zones right now.
I sit here and answer their questions,
provided they come in the form of a single yes or no proposition.
Well, then, let me give that a try.
Would you like to be the Vice President?
Yes or no?
Hold on a minute.
I am very sorry.
Let me have  minutes to wrap up these meetings.
And then what do you say we get out of the office
and away from this damn phone?
Meet me at my car.
Betty can tell you where it's parked.
Go ahead.
He's deflecting.
What I can't tell is whether it's because
he's inclined to say no or wants to be wooed to say yes.
Either way, I'll have to ease him into the conversation,
not be so blunt.
This trip may take longer than I thought.
We've looked through all the file cabinets.
They're not on his computer?
Not with the Congressman's handwritten notes.
All right. I'll check his office.
There is a comfort to these woods.
Like they're my backyard.
Well, they are my backyard, in a way. I own them.
How much land?
Six thousand acres.
You think I could get a tour of your Fulton plant while I'm in town?
If you'd like. But...
I don't know why you'd want to be there
when you could be out here.
I've never seen a nuclear plant.
Not much to see.
Steel, concrete, a lot of steam.
The President hasn't exactly been a big supporter of nuclear power.
Is that, uh, part of your hesitation...
that fear that the administration...
He's just being savvy.
Nuclear energy is a tough sell after Japan.
But it's the only option we have right now
that doesn't completely trash the planet.
The argument against nuclear power is an emotional one.
And you don't make decisions based on emotion.
Decisions based on emotion aren't decisions at all.
They're instincts,
which can be of value.
The rational and the irrational complement each other.
Individually, they're far less powerful.
And which category do your thoughts on the
vice presidency fall into?
Do you hear that song?
It's a hermit thrush.
Can't see him.
"Solitary, the thrush...
"The hermit, withdrawn to himself,
"avoiding the settlements,
"sings by himself a song."
  Do you know the poem?   No, I don't.
It's Walt Whitman.
It's about the death of Abraham Lincoln.
He's over there somewhere.
Yes, I know the damn poem.
We studied it at the Sentinel.
I said to my Professor,
"Why mourn the death of Presidents, or anyone for that matter?
"The dead can't hear us."
And he asked me if I believed in heaven.
I said no.
And then he asked if I had no faith in God.
I said, "You have it wrong.
"It's God who has no faith in us."
Deeper into the woods.
I think you're being paranoid.
He came up right after I sat down. It was creepy.
I'm telling you, it was Womack.
Is that what Underwood said?
He didn't name names. But who else?
What's the big deal? Congressmen trade favors.
One of these congressmen committed suicide.
I think you're stretching here, Janine. To try and connect...
I have gone after big fish before.
I know what it feels like to be watched.
Underwood's education bill went to the floor
just three days after Womack became majority leader.
You leaked the education bill.
And then there was the Kern article.
Those were two completely different stories.
Wait. What was the guy?
Uh, what was his name?
He's the one who told that Kern wrote the article for the school paper.
  Roy Kapeniak.   You should go talk to him.
  There's no link.   Except you.
Underwood's been using you, Zoe.
Don't you want to know why?
Remy Danton's on line two.
He says it's important.
  Hello, Remy.   Hey, Claire.
I got a call from the P.R. Team at Sancorp.
They said Gillian Cole isn't being cooperative.
Hasn't gotten back to them, you mean?
No. Told them point-blank she doesn't want the film crew there.
I'm looking at an e-mail. She wrote that
they would be disruptive to the project and local community.
Is that her, or is that coming from you?
No. I made it very clear that I wanted her to work with them.
Well, it seems like she's doing the opposite.
I will speak to her,
and then I'll sort things out with the P.R. Team personally.
  Thank you, Claire.   You bet.
Is Gillian at lunch?
She didn't come in yet today. She's not feeling well.
Let me know when she gets here.
  What time is your flight?   :.
We should get going. There's gonna be traffic.
Almost ready.
I've been thinking.
The, uh, older man you were with.
Was it Underwood?
So, what this is really about is covering your own ass.
That is not true.
You don't want anybody to know you were sleeping with him.
Not exactly objective reporting, is it?
Don't fucking lecture me on journalistic ethics.
How many of the stories you brought me at the herald
  were because you were...   I'm not gonna have this conversation.
Fine. Maybe you should take a cab to the airport.
Don't punish me for being honest.
You haven't been honest. I had to ask.
And you still haven't given me a straight answer.
Yes.
It was him.
I... I don't know if I can do this, Zoe.
  Do what?   You fucked a Congressman to get ahead.
I'm not the first person to ever do something like that, Lucas.
But I'm not sleeping with those other people, am I?
What, so you just hate me now?
No. I probably love you.
That's the fucking problem.
Let's go. I'm parked illegally.
So I hear you went stomping through the woods today.
We did, and then Raymond was kind enough
to arrange a tour of the Fulton plant.
And I'm sure you were wondering,
"When is this old fool gonna get around to brass tacks?"
I'm here to simply answer questions.
I figured that you would make up your mind when you're ready.
There are two minds here.
We know all about the blind trust.
Does it concern either of you?
The words "Blind" And "Trust"
are not among my favorites in the English language.
But I have no problem with it in theory.
Not managing our assets for a few years
could unburden us from a great deal of stress.
Well, then, what does your reluctance stem from?
Why do you think the President wants me?
Well, I can't speak on his behalf, but if I were to...
Aren't you here to do just that... speak on his behalf?
If I were to speculate, I think the President would prob...
Speculation is a poor form of investment
and an equally poor form of politics.
Tell me what you know.
I don't know what you mean.
Well, what do you think I should do?
You, personally, Frank Underwood?
My opinion isn't what matters here.
It does to me. Should I do it? Yes or no?
Well, there's a great number of things to consider...
And I'm sure you've considered them all.
Yes or no, Frank?
No, I will not answer that question.
Because you think I shouldn't.
Because it's not relevant.
All right, then. Let me ask you another way.
Would you take the job?
It hasn't been offered to me.
What if it were?
I have a distaste for hypotheticals
just the same as you have a distaste for speculation.
All right, all right.
That's enough business for now. We can discuss it more tomorrow.
Get in. Get in there, Bruce.
Sorry. Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Um, I'm looking for Roy Kapeniak.
I thought his trailer was over here. Am I in the right place?
You're in the right place a month ago.
He got evicted.
He was shootin' off his gun too much in the yard.
Do you know where I can find him?
Why?
I'm a relative. His... his niece.
Skipped town is what I heard.
Had a girl livin' with him. Maybe she knows.
  Name was Echo.   Echo?
That's what she went by, at least.
Works at the titty bar over on .
Highway ?
  Across from the Burger King.   Okay. Thank you.
Girls get in free.
  I'm looking for Echo.   Who?
Echo.
Roy was a fucking wacko.
I was stupid to live with him as long as I did.
  Do you know where he is now?   I don't know, and I don't care.
He ever talk about the article I wrote?
All the time. He had it framed.
Bet it's still in the trailer
if it's not in a junkyard right now.
Did he say why he called me?
  Did he ever tell you?   I was there.
  Where?   When the guy showed up.
Who?
I won't name names.
Fuck Roy Kapeniak.
You don't owe him shit.
Some guy who said he was a Congressman.
Was it...
him?
No.
He was younger, tall,
not much hair, pretty good-looking.
  Yeah, that was him.   You're absolutely sure?
He brought bourbon, blow, stayed the whole night.
The whole thing was his idea.
What, to say that Kern wrote the editorial?
That guy didn't write anything. It was all Roy.
Okay, look, I know I said that I wouldn't name names,
and I won't if that's what you want.
But you could be famous overnight.
Talk shows, TV, the whole country...
No way.
You wouldn't have to dance anymore.
You could do whatever you want.
Don't use my fucking name, okay?
I already said more than I should have.
  Stamper, it's midnight.   Two things, boss.
First, Janine Skorsky
ambushed Christina this morning.
I intercepted her before she could ask too much.
  Should we be worried?   I can keep this contained, sir.
I just wanted you to know.
All right. What's the other thing?
Doyle came back with his research.
I just e-mailed it to you.
The President told you he and Tusk didn't know each other, right?
Yeah. He said they met once, I think,
at a fund-raiser.
That would appear to be a lie.
All right. I have it in front of me now.
Doyle catalogued all the instances he could find
in which the two of them were in the same city at the same time.
Items in red are events that they both attended.
And he found something else.
Back in Walker's private sector days,
he was the C.E.O. of Pioneer Airlines.
Guess who owned a third of the stock
when it was sold to united?
Raymond Tusk.
My guess is that he and Walker know each other quite well.
All right. Let me look this over. I'll call you back.
I'm being played.
But why?
  Did I wake you again?   No.
I'd like to talk.
Give me a moment.
Carolina Parakeet.
You're wrong, but you're close.
This is the Sun Conure.
They look very similar,
but the Carolina Parakeet is extinct.
Was killed off because it was considered a pest.
Interesting species, though.
Voracious appetite.
And he was poison. Cats who ate him died.
This bird is not the only thing
you've misidentified since you've been in St. Louis.
You and Walker are old friends.
I wasn't sent here to vet you.
Very good.
Tell me why I am here, then.
So I can vet you.
For the vice presidency?
The President values my advice, and he tends to follow it.
Like when I advised him not to make you Secretary of State.
That was very bad advice.
Yes, it was.
One of the larger mistakes I've made,
and I very rarely make mistakes of any size.
You've proven yourself to be quite difficult.
Kern, the teachers' strike, now Matthews.
You attribute all that to me?
If I had to guess.
A smart man once said to me
that speculation is a poor form of politics.
Why don't you stick to what you know, Raymond?
What I know is you are extremely effective
at what you set your mind to.
That is valuable to me,
and I've already told Garrett that it could be valuable to him...
somebody at his side with one foot in the executive branch
and one in the legislative.
He is very open to the idea.
My turn to speculate.
Your recommendation...
comes at a price.
Fact.
I have something that you want.
You have something that I want.
Have I said something amusing?
Oh, I've just sat too many times on your side of the table
not to enjoy the irony of finding myself on this side of it.
Would you like to hear what I want?
I don't shackle myself to people I don't know.
What I want is one favor.
One and only one.
Which is?
I need to be certain you'll grant it
before I'll take the risk of being more specific.
A blank check.
Of sorts.
You would never grant anyone a blank check.
No. But I'm not sitting on that side of the table.
We still believe in handshakes where I come from.
Do they still mean anything in Washington?
  Who are you calling?   Car service to get me to the airport.
Frank,
I will tell the President that I want until Friday
to think things over before I make my recommendation.
Let me know if you change your mind.
And let me arrange the car for you.
Hi. I'd like to arrange a car, please.
  How are you feeling?   Better than yesterday.
But I might take off early if, uh, the nausea comes back.
I find it interesting that you stay home
the day after you blow off the sancorp people.
You weren't feeling sick, Gillian.
I find it extremely offensive
that you'd accuse me of hiding behind my pregnancy.
You knew what I wanted.
The Botswana project is mine.
Under my umbrella, using money I raised.
You promised me autonomy.
Um, excuse us for a moment, please.
I promised to empower you.
That's not the same thing
as you doing as you choose without consulting me.
I'm not gonna allow a project I've put almost three years
  of my life into...   your project wouldn't be happening
if it weren't for sancorp.
I didn't ask for their help.
How about consulting me before you struck a deal?
Let's get something very clear.
I run the organization. You work for it.
Our agreement is an affiliation, Claire.
  Worldwell isn't your vassal.   Yes, it is, entirely,
if we're going to be blunt about it.
That's not what you proposed six months ago.
It's what you signed up for when you signed the contract.
There was a good faith understanding that...
And you dissolved that good faith by disobeying me.
  Disobeying you?   Yes.
I threaten you, don't I?
Nothing about you threatens me.
But maybe you should take a leave of absence.
Are you firing me?
That's up to you, but right now you should leave.
Did you get her on record?
No. She wouldn't talk to me otherwise.
We need hard proof that Underwood was behind it.
This whole thing is making me really nervous.
That you'll be exposed?
Not that.
It's Francis.
If this really goes as deep as we think,
and he's already watching you...
  You think he's dangerous?   I know he is.
Then that's why we have to keep going.
He crushes people...
  Hey, Callum.   Hey.
Look, if you weren't afraid, you wouldn't be doing your job.
The only articles that I have ever written
that truly mattered scared the shit out of me.
We need to know about anything that might've happened with Russo.
Something Underwood could have held over him.
We have to go back to Christina Gallagher,
see if she'll give us something.
It can't be me. If I go back for a second time...
I'll do it.
You honestly had no idea that the President and Tusk were close?
He never showed up once on any call sheet,
phone log or schedule during
the campaign or since we've been in office.
I'd love to believe you, Linda,
but I'm finding it very difficult.
What would I gain by keeping you in the dark?
I am as shocked as you are, Frank.
Well, don't let on that you know.
  Of course not.   What's the President saying?
He wants to meet with you Tuesday to get your report on Tusk.
That's a farce.
Should I come up with a reason to delay the meeting?
No. Maybe we'll learn something.
  What time?   : P.M.
All right. I'll be there. Thank you, Linda.
  We have one week.   To accomplish what exactly?
To force Tusk's hand. He wants me beholden to him? No.
We have to make him come crawling to me.
What's his weakness?
His fortune.
Wouldn't you say that's his strength?
Not if it's slipping away.
  How do you make  billion disappear overnight?   We can't.
But maybe we can create the illusion that it's in danger.
The brief you gave me on his assets.
How much of his total net worth is...
in nuclear power?
About a third.
Sixteen reactors here in the states,  worldwide.
Well, that's what we hit him with.
We go after his nuclear interests.
Even so,
he's got  billion in other investments.
Doug, this is a man who built his fortune from nothing.
The money doesn't mean anything to him.
It's what it represents.
  Which is what?   His life's work.
Get Remy Danton on the phone.
Set up a meeting as quickly as you can.
You got it.
Tusk understands the difference between power and money.
That's precisely what makes him dangerous.
He doesn't measure his wealth in private jets
but purchased souls.
I've worked too hard to get within arm's reach of the prize
only to have my hand cut off just before I seize it.
Zoe Barnes, here to see Christina Gallagher.
I'm sorry. I don't see an appointment.
Oh, there must be a mistake. I have an :.
One second.
My name is Zoe Barnes.
I work at Slugline.
You spoke to my colleague Janine Skorsky.
  Miss...   Oh, we're fine, thanks.
You can't just come in here...
There are things you don't know about Peter.
I wrote the article about Roy Kapeniak.
Please leave. Right now.
It was Peter who convinced him to talk to me.
What? I don't... I don't understand.
  Why would he...   Somebody pressured him to do it.
The night of January th.
That's when he went to speak to Kapeniak.
Do you remember anything strange
around the time of the inauguration?
  Anything that could have been held over him?   No, I don't.
If he was mixed up in things
that in any way contributed to his suicide,
wouldn't you want to know?
I'm not trying to cause you any more pain.
I just want the truth.
And you deserve that more than anyone.
  What was the date?   The th of January.
Blind TrustHouse.of.Cards.SE
What was that?
The faucet.
It wouldn't shut up.
  Did you sleep last night?   No.
I'll call Nancy and tell her to call a plumber.
Absolute discretion. Can I count on that?
  Always.   Raymond Tusk.
The President wants to tap him as the new V.P.
  You and I cannot let that happen.   Why not?
Because a third of his fortune is tied up in nuclear energy.
Sancorp does not want a pro-nuclear businessman in the White House.
The market is shifting toward natural gas anyway.
But Tusk wants to stall that shift or reverse it.
Vice President doesn't have that kind of influence.
This one would. He and Walker are very close.
And it's in neither of our best interests
to seep Sancorp's position in the marketplace diminished.
What's the ask?
Tusk won't accept the nomination
if he thinks his holdings are at risk.
Sancorp needs to initiate a hostile takeover.
He's worth three times what Sancorp is.
I'm talking about the subsidiaries.
We go after the companies that refine and ship the uranium,
  the support system that...   Come on, Frank.
There's stockholders to take into account,
a huge financial exposure.
We just need to distract him.
Send a few token salvos and intimate there's more to come.
All I'm asking is that you speak to your client
and see if this is something they might be willing to consider.
The President announces Tusk on Friday,
so we don't have a lot of time.
  I'll make some calls.   Thank you, Remy.
If he doesn't deliver, I'm an invader without an army.
If he does, I've got a fighting chance.
I just didn't feel that
we could work together constructively any longer.
I think that's a perfectly legitimate reason...
Of course it is.
But what you can't do is fire someone for being pregnant.
Is that what she's saying?
Ms. Cole claims that you said,
quote, "I need employees, not mothers,"
and, quote, "Go focus on your baby."
Can I see that?
That's completely false. I...
  I never said that.   She claims you did.
It's her word against mine, right?
Well, juries are very sympathetic with expecting mothers.
This is extortion.
We don't want this going to trial, Claire.
You and your husband are public figures.
This will result in some very bad press.
I suggest we go back to them with a settlement offer.
  We need the arrest record.   There isn't any.
  They let him go.   Then we need to know who got him off.
If Underwood was involved,
we are talking abuse of powers and corruption.
I checked.
There's no files, no mug shot, nothing.
Then we need to find the cop who pulled him over,
or somebody who saw him come into the station.
But D.C. Cops... they look after each other.
We need to be careful.
Do you have any sources on the force?
Not that I would trust with something like this.
You know, Lucas started out on the crime beat.
I can see if he knows anyone.
  Would he help us?   I don't know.
  Maybe.   Help out a competitor?
We... stayed in touch.
You've gotta be kidding me.
This town is way too incestuous.
I know it's a lot to ask.
I'm still trying to wrap my head around the affair, Zoe.
If you could just give me a contact and maybe vouch for me...
Did you wait to bring this up until now
because you thought it'd be harder for me to say no?
  What do you mean?   In bed, right after we...
You don't actually think I would do something like...
  It sure seems that way.   This is huge, Lucas.
I'm trying to avoid fucking up what we have...
Whatever that is... and you're making it really hard for me.
I don't know that I'll ever be the kind of person that makes it easy.
I'm not looking for easy.
But I don't need to be reminded of him.
  I can't erase what I did.   I know you can't.
But this is really fucking manipulative.
Did you mean what you said the other night?
That you probably...
I don't know what to do when I hear something like that.
That's why I was so quiet when you drove me to the airport.
I was angry. I just blurted it out.
I wish I hadn't. At least not like that.
I'm not trying to take advantage of you because you did.
  He hasn't said a word.   And you haven't brought it up?
I just asked him if he was still considering Tusk.
He said yes, but that he wanted to speak to you first. That's it.
I wish we knew if they'd spoken at all.
Well, he has a private line. I can't track those calls.
  Frank.   Mr. President.
Tell me about St. Louis.
He's a hard man to read. I did my best to probe him,
but I don't think I left any wiser to which way he's leaning.
I must say, though,
I think he is by far and away the best candidate.
Why do you say that?
Doesn't it make sense for you to nominate someone you know so well?
I don't know him. That's why I sent you to St. Louis.
Forgive me, Mr. President. I didn't mean it that way.
I meant that the world knows so well.
You, me, everyone knows Raymond Tusk.
We don't need to convince anyone of his worthiness.
But you said he still seems ambivalent?
Which is why I think you should make a personal overture.
Invite him to the White House.
Well, I don't want to appear desperate.
I agree with Frank.
Inviting him is a very good idea.
If you're serious about Tusk, you should wine and dine him.
Make him feel very special.
I'm sure we can find time in the schedule.
Let's give him a few more days.
We have less than a week, sir.
I wouldn't wait any later than Friday.
We can make Friday work, sir.
All right. Well, let's see if he's available.
What are you doing?
  Give me your phone.   Why?
Just give it to me.
Have you noticed anything weird in here?
Stuff moved around? Anything missing?
  No.   Anyone following you?
What did you find out?
This is serious, Zoe.
It goes way up, as high as the commissioner.
I had to beg my contact at Metro to give me this.
No record of Russo getting pulled over,
but he remembers there was a call girl brought in with Russo.
That's a file on one of her previous arrests.
I've investigated police cover-ups before.
I got death threats for a year.
Are you willing to take that risk?
Yeah.
How long?
The next board of directors meeting is three weeks from now.
That is too late. Remy, look,
the President is gonna nominate Tusk in a week or less.
I've urged Scott Cunningham to call a special meeting,
but that doesn't happen overnight.
There's a lot of machinery in a corporate attack like this.
I want to meet Scott Cunningham myself.
I'm not sitting you down with Scott. You know the rules.
These are extraordinary circumstances.
Frank, Sancorp's officers
do not meet with politicians, period.
You talk to me, I talk to Scott Cunningham,
and vice versa. That's how it works.
All right, Remy. Whatever you think best.
I'll call you when I know more.
Nancy!
Of all the things I hold in high regard,
rules are not one of them.
I will not place my fate solely in the hands of the middleman
if I can go directly to the supplier.
Book a flight to Atlanta. Tomorrow morning. Let Meechum know.
Yes, sir.
She grew up in Lynchburg, Virginia,
went to Lorimer High School
until she dropped out sophomore year,
and then after that, there's no public record.
But all it says here is that she was fined  
for loitering on April .
One of us has to go to Lynchburg.
Parents, classmates,
  teachers...   I'll do it.
Okay. Well, then, you and I have to call escort services.
I'm willing to lend a hand,
but not by making cold calls  hours a day
just to get hung up on by hookers.
Where was she arrested?
  Connecticut ave.   .
That's the address of the district grand hotel.
I'm not a fan of surprise visits, Frank.
Remy wouldn't arrange a meeting.
Remy Danton exists so we don't have to meet.
I needed to speak with you.
There's a congressional travel report
that puts you on a trip to Atlanta
the same day I was pulled out of an investors' briefing.
Those are the sort of coincidences we want to avoid.
Were you briefing your investors on Raymond Tusk?
Meechum can be trusted.
Why would I be speaking to them about Tusk?
  I thought Remy filled you in.   No.
He didn't say anything about the vice presidential nomination?
He didn't. And I have a feeling I'd rather not be told.
Trust me, you want to know.
I've appeared in front of grand juries before, Frank.
It's much easier when you can tell the truth.
Please, don't put me in a position where I have to lie.
If Tusk has the President's ear,
you will see this administration
shift its support toward nuclear energy and away from natural gas.
His subsidiaries and his suppliers, go after them.
Frank, we should end this conversation right now.
He will not accept the nomination
if his assets are in a blind trust
and he can't fight off the threat.
  Okay, we're done.   Scott...
I don't wanna hear another word.
Go back to the airport.
Figure out a good reason you needed to be in Atlanta today.
You can pull over at the next corner.
I'll have my car pick me up.
  One last one?   Another.
  Can I get you something?   White wine.
Put that on my tab.
  Thank you.   My pleasure.
They're about to call last call.
That's all right. I don't have much of a tolerance.
One more?
No. I'm good.
You should head upstairs.
I was waiting for you.
  Is that the new faucet?   Yeah.
How'd it go?
Not good. Remy's up to something.
He's not returning my phone calls.
What can I do?
Tell me what you were dreaming.
Oh, it was so awful, Francis.
He's not letting me sleep either.
Yeah. It's not him. It's the kids.
I was playing with them in the backyard,
and the girl was climbing on the vines,
and I kept telling her to stop and get down, and...
The vines just took hold of her, and they wouldn't let go.
And she was screaming so loud,
and I just kept pulling harder and harder,
and she just ripped in half.
Come here. Come here. Okay.
Jesus!
in the morning to return my call?
You trying to get my voice-mail?
The conversations we're having we can't be having on cell phones.
Where are you?
Claire is sleeping upstairs.
You shouldn't have gone to see Cunningham.
He says you didn't bring up Tusk.
You really think he'd admit to that?
If we go through with this, it's insider trading.
He didn't strike me as a man hearing the news for the second time.
You want to believe I'm playing games?
I can walk away from the whole thing.
But I'm all you've got right now.
I'm the one doing you and Sancorp a favor,
not the other way around.
I can tell when I'm being used, Frank.
I just want to know what for.
I don't use people unless I can throw them away afterwards.
I'm trying to strengthen our partnership.
Smells an awful lot like bullshit.
Don't condescend.
Eight years I worked on your staff
and never once made it further than your front doorstep.
Well, now I'm in your living room, Frank.
It's not because of what you taught me,
it's because I finally woke up to what my value is
and how undervalued I was slaving away for you.
This is business. Keep your sob story to yourself.
I want to maintain
the influence that I have worked to achieve in the White House,
which translates into the influence
that you have in the White House,
through me.
I'll get in touch with Scott again tomorrow.
See if we can push this forward faster.
Thank you, Remy.
But you gotta let me do this my way.
The message was very clear.
She doesn't want a settlement, no matter what the figure.
Even if we give her World Well back?
She wants to go to court.
They said we can expect a formal summons next week.
  This is ludicrous.   Her lawyers agree.
They'd much prefer a settlement too, but she's not playing ball.
I'll keep pushing them. But in the meantime,
you should start gathering
all the correspondence you ever had with her...
E-mails, notes, every scrap of paper.
Okay. Thanks, Oliver.
All I'm trying to do is find her.
I've got an arrest record from April ,
and I know she was pulled over with a client in January.
That girl. She had so much potential.
Why did she drop out?
Like I said, it's an ethical breach for me
to discuss anything that has to do...
I spoke to her parents.
Her father was very combative.
Was there trouble at home?
The father... did he...
I won't speak about Rachel.
Can you talk to me about your job in general,
the sorts of cases you deal with in an abstract way?
When I'm concerned about a student,
especially if there's possible criminal activity involved,
it's my duty to contact the D.A.'s office.
Now, if the D.A. pursues charges,
the student has to testify against their own parent.
That's a difficult decision for a young person to make.
Extremely difficult.
It could be easier to run away.
It's set for tomorrow.
and then heads straight to the White House
for dinner with the President.
  Is it on the official schedule?   No.
  We need it to be.   Well, I can't do that.
The President specifically asked that I leave it off.
Actually, that's good. We can make that work.
Can you set up a meeting between Birch and the President?
About what?
So he can give him his two cents about who he will nominate.
I don't think we want Birch getting involved.
  He'll never get the chance.   What are you planning?
Can you set up a meeting for later today? Yes or no?
I'm sure I can squeeze it in.
Good. I'll talk to Birch. Get him on the phone.
This has to stay off the books, just like the dinner with Tusk.
  Okay.   And finally,
do you have a scheduler that you can fire?
Janine, I've got something for you.
What is this?
The President's O.T.R. schedule between now and Friday.
  How'd you get this?   It doesn't matter.
Look who he's meeting with this afternoon.
  Bob Birch.   And look at Friday night.
Raymond Tusk.
These aren't the craziest meetings for him to be having.
Then why aren't they on the official schedule?
He's considering them for Vice President.
I'd say that's reason enough to keep them secret.
Get this out, right away.
Mr. Speaker, I'm hearing that
you're gonna be considered for the Vice Presidency.
Slugline is reporting that
you're heading to the White House right now.
  I'm, uh... no.   You're not headed to the White House?
Yes. The President just wants my input.
But there's the possibility
that you might be under consideration yourself.
Not that I'm aware of. Excuse me.
How did the schedule get out?
It got leaked, sir, by someone in the scheduling office.
  On purpose?   Accidentally.
A wrong attachment to an e-mail that went wide.
Well, whoever it was, I want them out.
I already let them go.
  Is, uh, Birch here yet?   He's waiting outside.
Well, cancel the meeting. Tell him something came up.
  I don't want to feed the frenzy.   Yes, sir.
Give me the private line, please.
There are three satellite trucks on my street.
I'm trapped in my own home.
Somebody in the scheduling office fucked up.
Are you seriously considering Birch?
Absolutely not.
We are losing control of the process, Garrett.
Every time I've spoken to you, you've never spoken back.
Although given our mutual disdain,
I can't blame you for the silent treatment.
Perhaps I'm speaking to the wrong audience.
Can you hear me?
Are you even capable of language,
or do you only understand depravity?
Peter, is that you?
Stop hiding in my thoughts and come out.
Have the courage in death that you never had in life.
Come out, look me in the eye and say what you need to say.
There is no solace above or below.
Only us... Small, solitary,
striving, battling one another.
I pray to myself, for myself.
Hello?
Who is it?
My lawyer said I shouldn't be talking to you.
Mine said the same thing.
I'm not gonna change my mind, Claire.
I made a mistake. I got upset, and I acted impulsively.
I was the one who made the mistake
by partnering with you in the first place.
Well, then, can we please both admit
that it wasn't meant to be, and we can find an amicable way...
  No, we can't.   What do you want?
To send a message.
Organizations like yours get   of the grant money,
then cozy up to corporate sponsors who destroy the environment.
The things you're claiming are lies.
I never mentioned your pregnancy.
I got in touch with Evelyn Baxter.
Remember her? We had a long conversation.
It seems that you have a history of axing people who disagree with you.
She'll be testifying on my behalf.
So will eight of the people that you made her fire.
If you want an apology, I'm here to offer you one,
and to give you whatever you think is fair.
This case is gonna get national attention
because of who you're married to.
I'll have a platform to say what I want to say.
That's worth more than anything you could offer.
Listen, I know we have different philosophies,
but what we're trying to achieve is exactly the same thing.
We shouldn't be fighting each other.
Do you feel that? The kicking?
I won't let people like you
fuck up the world my child has to live in.
If I have to tell a few lies to do that...
At least I learned one valuable thing from you.
  What can I get for you?   Glenlivet, neat.
The lawsuit?
And other things.
What other things?
You know, I cannot guarantee you
that all of this is gonna succeed.
Oh, it's not that.
You can tell me, or I can keep guessing.
You'll roll your eyes.
Not at you.
I was thinking about when one of us dies
whether it's you first or me...
Well, if it is me, and I'm sure it will be,
you won't be alone for long.
No. I mean, what will we leave behind?
We've accomplished a great deal.
And I intend for us to accomplish a lot more.
But for whom?
For each other.
But if we're not...
Ah, I'm being silly.
Have you ever been published?
Many times.
I guess that's a stupid question.
You don't seem like a starving artist.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
You have a nice laugh.
  Really?   It's very attractive.
Are you staying at the hotel?
You want to come up to my room?
That depends.
Well, how much would that cost me?
That seems about right.
Close your eyes.
Put out your hands.
Now open them up.
I'm trying to find this woman.
If you make me pull out my badge,
I have to take you in.
But I don't want to do that.
Let's not make a scene.
I used to see her around.
She left the business, though. We haven't really kept in touch.
Any idea where she might be?
A friend of mine saw her waiting tables
at a restaurant in Georgetown.
I guess the question I'm trying to ask is, um...
Is it even worth that step?
The bottom line is that
for a woman your age, it's extremely hard.
Have you ever had a miscarriage?
No. I, um...
I've been late before, but
I don't... You know, I don't know. I don't know exactly.
Have you had any abortions?
Three.
That can make it more difficult.
I'm not trying to dissuade you,
but please make sure you think long and hard before you decide.
But it's possible?
Assuming you and your husband fit all the criteria?
Yes, it's possible.
Okay.
What? Well, that's hardly my problem.
No, you get on it. It's...
I have to call you back. What is it?
Sancorp's stock.
It's up   in the last four hours.
It's all over the financial news.
Tusk is making a play.
Get Remy on the phone.
Congressman Underwood on line three.
I was just about to call you.
I need to meet with Tusk before he sees the President tonight.
  He's already here.   At the White House?
He decided to come in a few hours early.
His plane landed half an hour ago.
  Do you know where he is?   I don't know.
He had his own car pick him up. I just found out.
Remy's not in his office.
I left word there and on his cell.
Look, you need to call me the moment you know where he is.
Okay.
It's just the lunch menu right now. I hope that's okay.
Yeah. That's fine.
Your server will be with you shortly.
Is Rachel working?
Uh, no. I don't think she's scheduled till Sunday.
Stephanie will be with you this afternoon.
Thanks.
Should we come back Sunday?
I'll be right back.
Excuse me. Can I help you with something?
Yeah. I was just looking for the bathroom.
Unless you want to use the restroom in the office.
  Who are you calling?   Rachel.
Rachel Posner?
My name is Zoe Barnes.
I'm a reporter at slugline.Com.
I know about Peter Russo.
Rachel?
Come on, Rachel.
You shouldn't have mentioned Russo.
  She'll write back.   I wouldn't if I was her.
How much do you know?
That you were with him when he was pulled over.
  Who else knows?   Just me.
I can keep it that way, but I need more.
  There is no more.   You're lying.
Yeah, I was with him when he got pulled over.
They took him away and let me go.
I don't know what happened to him.
He was never charged.
You know more than me, then.
No one ever came to talk to you?
  About what?   To keep you quiet.
You don't kiss and tell in that business.
Not even when it's a congressman?
Especially when it's a congressman.
Frank Underwood never approached you?
Who's that?
You're too smart to play dumb, Rachel.
You know who that is.
Name rings a bell.
I try not to follow the news.
Too many familiar faces.
How about Douglas Stamper?
Never heard of him.
I've told you everything I know.
I know about what your father did.
If you don't help me, I'll write about Russo.
I'll write that you were a prostitute,
and I'll write about why you left home.
Go to town, bitch.
So?
She mentioned both you and your boss.
  What exactly?   She didn't say.
All she seemed to know was that
I was in the car with him when he got pulled over.
And you didn't admit to more than that?
No. I said everything exactly like you told me to.
  You really think I'd spill my guts?   Calm down.
Why didn't you tell me he was gonna hurt himself?
I never would've done it.
How could I have known?
  I just want all this to go away.   It will.
All of it.
I promise.
Do you want me to order you dinner?
  Where's Doug at?   I don't know. He left early.
  Call him for me, will you?   Yes, sir.
Thirteen minutes from now,
Tusk will meet with the President,
if he isn't there already.
You've never been an ally, have you?
Pressing on with your slow, incessant march.
Time would've killed Russo if I hadn't,
just as it will kill me someday.
Kill us all.
Sir, I just got Doug's voicemail.
I wonder where he's at.
Well, maybe this is him.
Freddy?
Sorry, Frank. I had to trade up.
Sancorp's a big fish, but Raymond Tusk is a whale.
Can I get you something, Frank?
Nothing right now. Thank you, Freddy.
I'll leave y'all to it.
I hope you don't mind that
Remy told me about this little secret of yours.
I wanted a place where you'd feel comfortable.
Shouldn't you be at the White House?
How could I pass up the chance to eat the best ribs in Washington?
Remy told you about Sancorp.
As of closing bell today, I own  .
By the end of next week, I'll own over ten.
Enough to make sure they can't cause me any trouble.
A valiant effort, though. I respect that.
So why are we here?
I told you I'd give you until today to think things over.
  I'm a man who keeps my word.   And I'm still not interested.
You wanted me to be more specific back in St. Louis.
That would be a good start.
Why did Britain go to war with China  years ago?
I'm in no mood for riddles.
Humor me a moment.
  Opium.   It was bigger than opium, Frank.
That was simply the excuse.
Peking wanted to call the shots instead of the west.
It's the same problem we're facing now.
But nobody wants a trade war, much less a military one.
And what's your opium?
Samarium . I need it for my reactors.
China controls   of the world's supply.
And you're worried about
the imbalance in our currency, our foreign debt...
  All of it.   You already have the President's ear.
Trade tariffs are controlled by congress.
You have a lot more influence there than Garrett does.
It's the reason I wanted you to stay there in the first place.
And what exactly would you want me to do?
Well, that part I don't know yet.
We'll have to wait and see how things play out with the Chinese.
I've already told you I will not do a blank check.
I must say I'm surprised, Frank.
You have a reputation for pragmatism.
And I also have avoided a reputation for indentured servitude.
I never make an offer more than twice, Frank.
Tell me now if I can count on your cooperation.
You're not offering cooperation. You're demanding tutelage.
So let me make you a proposal.
I am absolutely willing to work together as equals.
I will take your opinions seriously, just as the President does.
But I will not bind myself to them in advance.
If that doesn't interest you, fair enough.
Good luck finding a vice President in the next four days
who will prove as pragmatic as I.
You can't purchase loyalty, Raymond.
Not the sort I have in mind.
If you want to earn my loyalty,
then you have to offer yours in return.
And if we can agree to that...
Well,
you're a man with imagination.
Wait.
If Stamper was there himself,
this goes much deeper than a lost arrest file.
Well, let's think about this.
What did Russo gain him?
A mansion in Harrisburg.
Uh-uh. Underwood thinks bigger than that.
  Then what?   I don't know.
He controls Pennsylvania.
He has influence in the White House.
  Walker needs the state for reelection...   No.
No, it can't just be Walker.
The President backstabbed him for the secretary of state nomination.
It has to be something else.
The President would owe him.
But what?
They already meet once a week.
The education bill? I mean, what?
What specifically?
He could be after the V.P. Nomination.
That doesn't make sense, though.
The V.P. slot is on the table because Russo tanked.
Underwood wanted him to win.
Unless he didn't.
Maybe he wanted Russo to self-destruct.
To force Matthews to run.
Exactly. And then next week, when Matthews wins...
The President taps Underwood.
Mr. President.
Mr. Tusk.
Thanks for coming on such short notice.
Have a seat, Frank.
I have a confession to make.
Raymond and I have known each other for years.
We don't publicize it,
but he's been a trusted advisor to me.
And I sent you to St. Louis
so he could spend time with you,
give me his two cents.
On what, sir, if I may ask?
Offering you the vice presidency.
I told the president that, uh, in my humble opinion,
both he and the country would be well served
by a man as experienced, intelligent, and loyal as you.
So I'm officially asking, Frank.
Sir, I... I don't know what to say.
Say yes.
Yes.
It would be a great honor, Mr. President.
Meechum.
I take care of my own,
and you've proved yourself to be very valuable.
I would like you to be part of my security detail
once I get confirmed.
That's the Secret Service, sir.
I'm capitol police.
Then I'll put you on the Secret Service.
If you're interested.
I'd be more than interested, sir.
Good.
And I'm extremely grateful.
Keep being valuable.
That's the best way to show your gratitude.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
Did the plumber finally come?
No. I fixed it.
Francis.
So proud of you, Francis.
I didn't do it alone.
I got here as quickly as I could.
Is something wrong?
I need you to be completely honest with me, Christina.
About what?
The other day, when I said that you should tell me
if anyone from the press started harassing you...
Zoe Barnes?
You said you wanted to talk about something on the phone.
Oh, no. That can wait.
No. Come on. Tell me.
I, um... earlier today...
The rowing machine, I saw, is broken.
Oh, it's my fault. The cable broke.
I haven't been able to replace it yet.
What about going for a run with me?
She's trying to smear Congressman Underwood.
It's a coordinated campaign by everyone at Slugline.
But she knew things.
Like what?
About Peter.
Something to do with Kern losing the nomination.
And?
Want me to drive alongside you, sir?
No. You stay here.
Yes, sir.
You ready?
Yes.House.of.Cards.SE
We could jump in the car if...
We'll wait.
  Did you get the congressman anything for his birthday?   No.
I got him cufflinks. Silver, with his   
We don't talk about birthdays. We don't do gifts.
Why not?
You should return the cufflinks.
Doug?
Tried calling you.
  I left my phone in the...   We need to talk.
What's going on?
Christina. I just spoke to her.
Did Zoe...?
Yeah. But that's not all.
They tracked down Rachel, too.
Francis?
Tell me about Rachel. Where is she?
I have her under control.
That's not what I asked.
I drove her home. We don't have to worry about her.
You said the same about Ms. Skorsky.
Anyone else involved?
Just Janine and Zoe.
They asked about Russo's arrest
and they know he went to see Kapeniak.
I assume that's as far as they've gotten.
Assume nothing.
I'll alert Barney Hull.
What do you want me to do about Zoe?
I'll handle Zoe.
Get to work.
Yes, sir.
I emptied it.
You're another year older on Tuesday.
And we can't have a vice president who smokes.
Can you finish?
What?
I'm good.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I just said finish.
Well, I don't want just    if you're not...
Okay, fine. Whatever.
Zoe, did I do something that made you...?
No.
Zoe, you can't say something like "just finish" and then shut down.
This is safe, Zoe. I'm not him.
Good morning, Jackie.
Good morning.
Richard Russell.,
Civil Rights Act. .
Not everyone can be on the right side of history.
No, not even Lyndon for a time,
but he would have never become majority leader without him.
Well, there's no Johnson Senate building.,
No. He had to settle for a presidential library.
So it's been some time since you and I have had a chance to catch up.
You've been an outstanding deputy, Jackie.
Far more effective than your more seasoned colleagues.
You're a coalition builder, a fighter when you have to be.
Tell me, where do you see yourself headed?
I'd like to aim for the chair of Armed Services.
Or Homeland Security.
Have you ever considered serving in the leadership?
I figure that might be possible eight, ten years from now.
Well, what if I suggested that you could serve in leadership this term.
To replace me. As whip.
You're being tapped for VP.
Let's assume that's true.
  Well, that makes sense. But me as whip?   Yes.
A third-term congresswoman?
A universally admired incumbent who also happens to be a war veteran.
Webb is next in line. Or Buchwalter.
So just consider that for a moment.
They'll draw votes from one another.
Oh, I'm not saying you wouldn't have to fight for it,
but I'd be willing to give you the ammunition.
Come over here.
What is this?
My files on Webb and Buchwalter.
Why don't you take a look?
We'll speak in a few days.
Oh, and, uh, there's one on you.
You might want to begin by reading that one first.
What'd Janine say?
Strip club's not open yet.
You'll look into Kapeniak?
If he's on the grid, I'll find him.
  Drop me at metro center.   Not the office?
I'm gonna talk to Rachel.
She'll deny everything, like she did last night.
She can't deny getting into Stamper's car. You saw her.
Maybe you send a version of the story, about her dad?
No one would print it.
Rachel doesn't know that.
She said, "Go to town, bitch."
It won't work. I have to get in her face.
Congratulations.
  We're thrilled for you.   Thank you.
I wanted to fill in Bob and Terry personally.
Now let's get to it. I have to leave for Pittsburgh in what?
Home stretch with Jim. Whistle-stop tour.
Looking good out there.
Very good. But we don't want to take any chances.
Now, your replacement as whip, Frank.
Bob has already shared some thoughts.
I like Howard Webb.
Webb is a solid choice. Have you thought about Wes Buchwalter?
Buchwalter's a hot-head.
Well, could you live with Webb, Frank?
Webb is a good tactician, but he lacks follow-through.
The problem with Buchwalter is he's too abrasive.
No charm. Lots of enemies.
Is there a third option?
They're the two most senior members in the caucus. It's their turn.
Mr. President, what if we let the caucus pick?
Let it be a wide-open race. Both men are qualified.
The leadership should be united in this.
We don't want to be backing different candidates, Frank.
So we stay out of it and neither of us backs anyone.
I like it.
Caucus will respect someone who did it the old-fashioned way.
Well, gentlemen, it's your call to make.
Figure it out amongst yourselves. Let me know what you decide.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Put me through to Secretary Lewis.
Frank, I don't want to go to battle with you on this.
We've been down that road.
I couldn't agree more.
An open race makes me nervous.
Well, look, it was just a suggestion.
  I'll put some thought into it.   Thank you.
You know, let me    let me go work on him.
Good luck.
What are you doing here?
Ask me what I want to order.
Have you decided, sir?
I need you to quit your job. Tell Leon it's your last day.
Why?
Act normal.
Did you want a side with that?
They found you once.
We can't take the chance they'll find you again.
What am I supposed to do about money?
Do as I say. Go home and pack your things.
I'll come by around ten.
  Well    but I don't get a say in any...   Stop it.
One suitcase. That's it.
  Can you at least tell me...   I'll take the shepherd's pie
with a side of Brussels sprouts.
To go.
We don't want a trial. Her lawyers don't want a trial.
But Ms. Cole won't listen to reason.
That said, if you give me a little more time, I think that   
If she wants to go to court, then let's give her that.
Just because she's being unreasonable now doesn't mean she   
I'm done.
That's a knee-jerk reaction.
I've never known you to be a person who was irrational or impatient.
Let me check back with her lawyers, and maybe we can   
What's the soonest we can get a trial date?
Claire...
Give me a timeframe.
Six months, at the earliest.
Inform her people, then no more communication.
As your counsel, it is my duty to strongly advise you against this.
I understand and I thank you, Oliver.
Thank you.
  So?   They wouldn't give me individual contact info,
but here's every doctor who served in east Africa
during the last three years.
And what about the HMO?,
You need a consent form. And it's in the packet.
Can I help you?
Yeah. I'm looking for Rachel Posner.
She's not here.
Uh, is she coming in later?
Why?
I know her.
Well, your friend really screwed me over.
What happened?
She took off, middle of her shift.
I had to put my hostess on wait staff duty.
Look, I'm concerned. Rachel's in real trouble.
I don't care what her personal issues are.
I just need to know where she lives.
I thought you knew her.
I do. It's just been a while.
And she sent me a text message saying she wants to hurt herself.
And now she won't answer her phone.
She has a history of mental illness.
You've gotta help me out.
Look, I can't.
Her W , the address is a P.O. Box.
I'll take whatever I can get.
  Let me see what I got in the office.   Thank you.
If you find her, you tell her not to come back.
I don't need some nutcase creating chaos in here.
  Nancy?   Yes, sir?
Is Doug back yet?
In his office. And, sir?
Birthday cards have started to arrive. A few presents.
Thank you notes. Inventory the presents. Anything valuable...
Goes in the conference room?
Anything cheap...
Goes to the interns.
And you know what to do with the cards.
Yes, sir.
I'm picking her up tonight.
I got everything set up for her in Joppa.
Where's that?
Maryland. About  minutes north of Baltimore.
That's close to home.
We want her to disappear, but not on us.
  Fine. Do you have the burner?   Yeah.
Happy birthday.
It's prepaid. All you need to do is turn it on and dial.
We still have the phone history.
All the more reason to be safe going forward.
Where are we with Christina?
I'm on it.
Linda's office. I called her this morning.
Are you Gillian Cole?
Yeah. Uh, have we met?
No, we haven't met. You know my husband.
Your husband?
David Applebaum.
So it's true.
It was a mistake.
You want to see our kids? I can show you pictures.
Mrs. Applebaum, I    I'm...
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Look, I'm sorry.
You're sorry? I don't think you're sorry.
And don't think for a second
you're gonna use that baby to get money out of us.
He doesn't even know I'm pregnant.
But you knew he was married.
How could you?
  Did he talk about us?   No.
Lying bitch. Am I embarrassing you?
Did you think about how you would humiliate me and my kids?
Use a condom the next time you fuck somebody's husband.
It's been less than  hours.
She quits her job in the middle of a shift?
She's scared.
I'd take off, too.
It's Underwood.
He's moving faster than we are.
What about the stripper?
Refuses to talk.
Kapeniak?
No current address. No siblings. Parents are dead.
Rachel's the last loose end.
She must know something else. Bigger than the DUI.
Any idea where she went?
I got a P.O. Box in Dupont, but none of the clerks have seen her.
I could go stake it out, but...
Have you talked to your guy yet?
In the next day or two.
He's bringing me the police report on Russo's suicide.
I'll press him for more.
And what's your next move?
Trying to figure out how to respond to this.
I got it a couple hours ago.
I think he's setting her up.
I know how to handle him.
The less he learns, the better.
We might learn something.
Not with him calling the shots.
I'm choosing the place.
As if that makes a difference.
I'm not gonna fuck him. Just talk to him.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
  I'm sorry. I shouldn't have      That's okay.
No, it's not.
I just don't want you to be careless.
I won't be.
You want no life?
You want more work than three people can handle?
You want a decent chance
that you could be fired within the first month?
If that tempts you, we can keep talking.
None of that intimidates me.
I've been running a congressional district for the past nine weeks
with zero assistance.
Nobody elected me.
Nobody taught me.
I've done it because somebody had to.
What happened was tragic.
But you won't get sympathy from me.
I don't have time for it.
I wouldn't be sitting here if I wanted a shoulder to cry on.
Rachel?
Leave.
I said leave.
Are you packed?
I'm not going anywhere.
So you didn't quit today.
I did, but I changed my mind.
This isn't your decision to make.
I'm keeping my job and I'm keeping this apartment.
No, you're not.
You promised you'd make all of this go away.
And you starting over is the first   
No, I already started over. I don't want to start over again.
I wish you didn't have to.
Get out.
Get out!
Lower your voice.
I'll fucking kill you.
Go ahead.
I am the only one who can protect you. Don't you see that?
You have no idea how much danger you're in.
Start packing.
You know I ask every year.
Nothing, as usual.
I thought we could have dinner.
Only if it's someplace where nobody will recognize us.
I don't want anyone walking up   
I mean at home. I'll cook something.
No cake.
No cake.
No gifts.
No gifts.
I can do that. How's the lawsuit coming?
We'll be fine.
We'd like to increase the size of your detail
to full head of state status, starting tomorrow.
Well, that won't be happening.
It's good to get a head start,
so that by the time they announce   
These are my last few days before I never have privacy again.
I intend to savor these moments for as long as I can.
But, sir, in terms of safety, I think   
Until I'm confirmed as the Vice President,,
security is at my discretion. Is that correct?
Technically, yes. But   
Then that's settled.
All right. We'll wait until the announcement.
Now, assuming the confirmation goes through,
we'll need to work out the logistics
of moving you into the Naval Observatory.,
That won't be happening, either.
The congressman will be remaining in his townhouse.
But it doesn't have the necessary security infrastructure.
Then you'll need to build it.
We're talking blast-proofing,
hardwired communications networks,  hour office space   
Where there's a will, there's a way.
I'll contact you directly about setting a plan in motion.
And one last thing before you go.
I'd like to have Edward Meechum serve on my detail.
He's Capitol Police.
For now. You're about to appoint him to the Secret Service.
That would require an accelerated training program.
Sir, we have plenty of qualified agents.
Men and women with years of experience.
And I look forward to working with all of them,
as long as Edward Meechum is on the detail.
Thank you very much for your time.
Thank you, sir.
Nancy, have Meechum bring the car around.
You know, the last time was the last time.
I know. But this is important.
You keep selling me that swampland. I'm done buying.
No more.
Cover-up. You said it went as high as Barney Hull.
That's not what I said.
When you gave me Rachel Posner's arrest file   
What I said is that arrests don't disappear without a big-ass wand.
That ain't the same as proof.
We think the congressional leadership took part.
I don't care.
Yes, you do. I know you do.
No, I really don't.
When you helped me expose the drug   
They were dirty street cops stuffing a few grams in their pockets.
This is different. Powerful fucking people.
Dirty cops are dirty cops. You want to protect them?
I have a pension and a family.
I understand. But   
Don't contact me again.
Where's your cell?
Here. It's not recording.
I need to ask you to delete all of our phone history.
Why would I do that?
I'm trying to protect both you and I.
I'm not facing prison.
You didn't cover up the arrest?
Is it because you wanted him to be governor?
No. He was in trouble, so I helped.
And later he expressed a desire to run, and I offered guidance.
To an alcoholic?
To a sober recovering alcoholic.
Did you want him to self-sabotage?
Absolutely not.
It got Matthews in the race.
I like to back people who want to succeed.
Take yourself as an example.
You just took advantage of the situation.
Matthews took advantage. I didn't seek the nomination.
Russo was in the passenger seat when he died.
That's not entirely accurate.
I saw the police report.
And I spoke to the commissioner directly,
because I cared about Peter and I wanted to know the full story.
He wasn't in the passenger seat?
The passenger door was open, and he was halfway out.
They think that...
he might have had second thoughts.
If I speak to Barney Hull, he'll confirm that?
What are you suggesting, Zoe?
Maybe there was foul play.
If there was a hint of foul play,
don't you think the police would have investigated?
The same police that buried his DUI?
And you think I was involved.
There's a connection between you.
listen to you. You sound ludicrous.
I'm just asking questions.
No, you're connecting dots that don't exist.
You want me to just walk away? Act as if I don't know anything?
Yes, I got Peter out of a jam.
Yes, I sent him to speak to Kapeniak.
But beyond that, there's nothing to know.
Can you blame me if I find it difficult to trust you right now?
Trust me or not,
but I'm about to be confirmed as the vice president.
And our relationship extends to the Oval Office now.
Don't step out of the sunlight for no reason.
Let's start this new chapter with a clean slate.
Now you sleep on that, and I'll be in touch.
We'll start with blood and hormone tests.
Those results should be back within a few days.
If they're good,
we'll move on to genetic testing for both you and your husband.
Have you spoken to him yet?
Not yet. I want to do the tests first.
We can do those anytime this week.
I'll have my office call yours.
I almost forgot.
I've been doing some research on the Internet.
Be careful of the Internet.
Well, I was looking into common issues
associated with post  pregnancies,
and this drug came up.
But there wasn't much on it. It's Cruvenae...
Cruvenae-tenuestrin.
You probably haven't found much because it's,
still in the beta stage.
And what does it do?
It helps maximize blood flow to the placenta.
Until CVT there hasn't been any viable drug for that.
The jury's still out.
But placental insufficiency affects women of all ages.
I wouldn't worry about it for now.
That's putting the cart way before the horse.
You know, Matthews has this locked up,
but conservatives on the hill are saying
he's gonna return to Harrisburg with the same myopic,
deficit-growing mentality.
Now, as to who's gonna replace Matthews when he wins...
Can I at least turn off the overhead?
Of course.
...someone even more fiscally irresponsible...
Do you want me to go work downstairs?
No. That's fine. Just make some room.
You haven't said a word.
No.
Where does that leave us?
I'm fully prepared.
And I have been for some time.
I know you'll do whatever you think is best.
But Underwood confirmed it.
He's gonna be tapped for VP.
That doesn't get us any closer.
Well, we know that Russo cleared the way for Matthews.
It reinforces the theory. It doesn't give us proof.
We can't go after the guy for playing dirty.
That's not news.
Half the fuckers in Congress play dirty.
He propped up a sham candidate, just to take him down.
Nobody forced Russo to drink that night.
The guy was an alcoholic.
Okay, we don't know what happened that night,
other than three days later he killed himself.
Are you gonna contact him again?
I don't know.
We need to slow down, take a step back, and reevaluate.
We already let Rachel slip away.
There's no point until we have more.
We should keep him guessing, not   
Wait   have more from where? From who?
I don't know.
But we should exhaust all options
  before Zoe reaches back out to Underwood.   But we don't have any options.
  It looks desperate.   We are up against a brick wall.
And unless Underwood  
Zoe...?
I just need to think.
Well, let's think about it together.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Freddy?
Yeah, Frank?
Was there something different about these ribs this morning?
Better or worse?
I didn't think that they could get any better,
but these were something special.
Well, tried a new butcher.
Slow-bleeds his hogs.
It ain't legal, but...
Well, I won't tell anyone.
I don't know if I'm gonna go back to him.
Went out to his shop.
He's got a room in the back
where he does it.
Soundproof. A whole setup.
W   why soundproof?
'Cause of how they scream.
They can smell it coming.
You stick that pipe in their throat,
the next  minutes is hell.
Bust your fucking eardrums.
Now, the humane way to do it is to make it quick.
Bring out a bucket of slop like it's feeding time and       bam.
Shovel right to the base of the head.
No screaming.
He's willing to open up the race, but Birch was very clear:
if he can't endorse anyone, you can't either.
That's fair.
You really want Buchwalter to win?
I want the best man to win.
That sounds like a cagey bullshit non-answer to me.
I'm on the sidelines for this one, Terry.
You're never on the sidelines, Frank.
I'll see you around.
Claire. You wouldn't return my calls.
I'll be back.
My attorney said that I shouldn't be in contact with you.
Blue Cross said my insurance was canceled.,
The severance package gave me health coverage for up to a year.
That sounds right.
So there must be some kind of mistake.
Well, you'll have to talk to the insurance company.
I did. They said it was terminated.
They can't reinstate it without the employer's approval.
And you want me to get involved?
There's medication that I need
that I can't get unless it goes through my HMO.
I'm well aware. I   I reviewed your records.
  What?   You signed a consent form.
No. I   I   I didn't.
You forged my signature?
Did a Mrs. Applebaum pay you a visit?
You realize what you're doing is  
Civil. Not criminal.
Have you thought this out? Because when we go to court  
You mean six months from now?
You're expecting in four, no?
That's four months without the medicine you need.
I'm wiling to let your child wither and die inside you
if that's what's required.
But neither of us wants that.
Now tell me, am I really the sort of enemy you want to make?
But here's the alternative.
This office, this staff,
The CWI could be yours.
And you and me, we wash our hands of each other.
You're trying to buy me.
No. When we first met, I promised to empower you.
I'm fulfilling that promise.
How do I get screwed?
You don't. I resign. You take my place.
No strings?
None.
Exit polls have Jim Matthews winning
by anywhere from a nine-to-twelve-percent margin of victory.
Hello?
Mrs. Underwood?
Yes.
Hi. I'm calling from Dr. Larson's office
to confirm your  a.m. tomorrow for the blood and urine tests.
I can't come.
Well, if tomorrow doesn't work,
we can reschedule for Thursday or even Monday  
No, I won't be rescheduling.
Please tell Dr. Larson I appreciate all her consultation,
but I've put a great deal of thought into this
and I won't be pursuing any further tests.
Thank you.
Have you thought about what we discussed?
I think you're right. We should start with a clean slate.
What about our text messages?
And the contact?
Are we good?
Yeah.
And we can put all this other nonsense behind us
and trust one another and continue to help one another?
I'd like that.
Then consider the slate clean.
Answer me one thing.
The passenger seat.
You said Russo was trying to get out.
That there was nothing ab  
I thought we just agreed to  
I want to believe you, but I need details.
More than what you're sharing.
What's your question?
The night Russo fell off the wagon he was at a fundraiser.
The McNeally Cancer Institute  
All in the police report.
Rachel Posner was at the hotel that night.
Who's that?
The call girl who was with Russo when he was arrested.
I didn't know her name.
She disappeared, Francis.
When?
Don't act surprised. I showed the bellmen a photo.
One of them remembers seeing her.
The girl's a prostitute.
I'm sure she frequents many hotels.
But that hotel on that night?
Well, now you sound like Ms. Skorsky talking.
I haven't discussed this with anyone.
I wanted to ask you first.
I have no idea what happened that night,
except that Peter started drinking again.
I don't know who was or wasn't there.
I wish I was.
Maybe I could have stopped him.
Do you know where Rachel is?
Listen to what I am saying.
I am trying to protect us both.
These are questions anyone could ask.
But no one is, except you.
I can't imagine what you're after.
I took a chance.
Showed up at your house and placed myself at your feet.
Crossed ethical lines, professionally, physically.
And I hold myself accountable for that.
Those were my choices, and I can live with them.
I'd like to move forward,
but I need to know exactly what I was a part of. That...
that I wasn't a part of someone's...
Finish your thought.
Part of someone's murder.
Jesus.
I want to believe you, Francis.
I know you   
Janine!
Come in.
I've been calling you.
Come in. Sit down.
Um, you    you want something?
Some, uh, water or, um, juice?
You going somewhere?
Hey. You going somewhere?
To my mom's. In Ithaca.
  What?   I'm leaving.
No. No, no, no. No. No way.
  We have nothing.   Are you giving up on this?
There are only three people in the world that know what he has done,
and one of them is gone.
If we had anything, Lucas,
any hard evidence
or even a fucking quote from a source that would go on record for us,
that would be one thing.
But we are grasping, and he is not fucking around.
You were the one who told Zoe to pursue this.
She told me what you said.
The only stories that mattered were the ones that scared you to death.
Okay, this isn't just death threats.
This is real.
He doesn't know about you, but he knows about me.
These were in my mailbox.
No return address.
He took these of her?
Who else? You can keep them.
But I don't think they're gonna help you.
We need to stop him.
Sick fucking shit.
Janine, you cannot run away from this!
My entire career, I have always chosen the tough stories.
I have been fearless.
But you know what?
I'm really fucking scared this time.
He's got power.
He's got a lot to lose.
And right now he is winning.
Please, I need your help. Please, don't do this.
Just wake the fuck up, Lucas!
The incident occurred at approximately eight p.m. last night
on the northbound tracks of the Cathedral Heights metro station.
D.C. Police have ruled the death an accident.
Zoe Barnes was a senior contributor at slugline.com.
Previously she worked at the Washington Herald
as a metro reporter and political correspondent.
Barnes broke several major stories,
include an early draft of the Education Reform and Achievement Act,
as well as a college newspaper article
that derailed Senator Michael Kern's
nomination for Secretary of State...
What'd you think of the files?
There's plenty to work with.
Did you look at your own?
There was nothing there.
Should there be?
No.
Even if you're lying,
the fact that I haven't been able to find anything
tells me you're very good at covering your tracks.
That's, uh, valuable to me. Here's our battleground.
You have the skeletons.
If I lose, they'll come after me.
That's a risk you have to take.
How do I know you're not just using me?
Throwing a wrench into someone else's bid?
That's another risk. The alternative is you wait  years.
You chose me for a reason.
I'd like to know what it is.
All right.
How many missile strikes did you launch?
Enough to keep me awake at night.
But you did it anyway.
Yes, I did.
How many women and children?
Too many.
And you launched those missiles
knowing all those innocent people would die.
I had orders to eliminate the enemy.
Which you carried out expertly and efficiently.
Have you ever killed anyone?
No.
I watched apartment buildings, entire villages gone,
like they were never there.
I'd prefer not to talk about it, if that's all right.
You did what needed to be done,
and that's why I chose you, Jackie.
Service background. Clean history.
Photogenic. The whole package.
But more importantly,
ruthless pragmatism.
Are we working together or not?
Any public or private endorsements for Buchwalter,
I come out for Webb.
I'll stay out of the fray. I give you my word.
Same goes for you, Terry.
Thank you, Christina.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President. How was Pennsylvania?
You like Indian?
Sir? I've seen the news.
I know she was close to you.
Terrible tragedy.
Spoke to Special Agent Rockland today, sir.
I begin my training next week.
Very good.
I know it's a day late.
Hope it isn't inappropriate,
but I wanted to give you this.
Thank you, Meechum.
That was very nice of Edward.
He shouldn't have spent this sorta money on me.
I've opened some wine downstairs.
I'll be down in a minute.
Did you think I'd forgotten you?
Perhaps you hoped I had.
Don't waste a breath mourning Ms. Barnes.
Every kitten grows up to be a cat.
They seem so harmless at first.
Small, quiet, lapping up their saucer of milk.
But once their claws get long enough, they draw blood.
Sometimes from the hand that feeds them.
For those of us climbing to the top of the food chain,
there can be no mercy.
hunt or be hunted.
Welcome back.House.of.Cards.SE
This is not the most inspiring choice for a vice president, right?
I    I mean, a well-respected operator. Pragmatic.
But let's face it.
This is probably just a nod to Congress.
Tapping one of their own.
It's really nothing more than a placeholder until , assuredly.
I'm not surprised he's doing a private swearing-in.
My bet is that the president wants to draw
as little attention to this as possible.
There's just no real wow fa  
Christina's working out well?
She's getting her sea legs, but I've been happy so far.
She works hard.
It's a big load off my shoulders
when she can travel with the president instead of me.
I get so much more done when I stay here.
The president have a preference in the whip's race?
Can't believe how ugly it's gotten.
It was more disappointing than anything.
Watch out. Yeah, it was.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Not at all.
This is something else.
Security specs. They had to work fast. Watch out.
It's like a war zone around here.
The idea is to keep the war from getting in.
How's the whip's race coming, congressman?
It's tight between you and Howard.
Well you'd have to ask Howard,
if he's not too busy trying to sodomize me.
Shall we go and say hello?
For god sakes, don't make me talk to that man.
Good to see you, Howard.
Nice to see you, Wes.
Yeah. I bet it is.
  Bob.   Frank.
Appreciate you inviting me, Frank.
  What?   Thanks for inviting me.
You bet.
Judge.,
Good to see you.
Is there somewhere I can go to change?
Yes, absolutely. There's room down the hall.
Doug, will you take care of the judge?
And when he's ready, let's get this thing over with.
I'll start bringing 'em in.
...that I take this obligation freely,
without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion...
...that I take this obligation freely,
without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion...
And that I will well...
One heartbeat away from the presidency,
and not a single vote cast in my name.
Democracy is so overrated.
...office on which I am about to enter, so help me God.
And that I will well and faithfully discharge
the duties of the office on which I am about to enter,
so help me god.
Congratulations, Mr. Vice President.
All right, let's get back to running the country.
Now, one of you is gonna replace me as the whip.
You're the two frontrunners, and we know you both want it.
And you're not behaving like men who belong in the leadership.
We need to tone down the rhetoric.
You're hurting your party.
I'm just responding to the lies Howard's been slinging.
Those junkets happened, Wes. I'm not making it up.
And nepotism's any better.
That's just not true, and you know it.
And your sister's husband just happened to be appointed state treasurer.
Ex-husband. And yes.
That is such a load of crap, Howard.
Gentlemen, Bob is right.
This sort of cat-fighting gets out in the press,
whichever one of you wins hits the ground limping.
Let's keep it clean and bring some civility back to the house.
Can we agree to that?
I'd feel a lot better if you shook hands on it.
Thank you.
I'm with him right now, Christina.
I'm off. I'll swing by your office later.
Don't. It's not ready yet.
I'll be working from here.
What?
Tusk is in town.
He's meeting with the president in  minutes.
Christina just told me.
The Joint Commission talks.
That's what she said.
Christina is proving useful.
We stay in touch.
Get me Cathy Durant.
Your people coming by?
Just my new chief of staff.
That's all I've got until we hire more.
So how does it feel to be married to the vice president?
Exactly the same. Just louder.
Secretary Durant.
Cathy.
Raymond.
Congratulations, Mr. Vice President.
Thank you very much.
May I please introduce Secretary Durant.
My pleasure, Madam Secretary.
This is quite a surprise.
I had no idea you were in town.
Morning, sir.
Mr. President.
Catherine.
We just happened to run into Raymond.
Wonderful.
Come on in.
The phone records will absolutely prove I'm right.
There were no phone records. You know that.
The data history with the carrier.
Even if we got the case reopened, which isn't gonna happen,
do you have any idea how hard it is to get a warrant for phone data?
Probable cause.
Bring him in for questioning.
Technically you have jurisdiction.
The vice president of the United States.
I know this all sounds preposterous to you,
but if    if you go through my notes   
We've been through your notes.
You've listened. But you haven't heard me.
Circumstantial, yes. But plausible.
I know you've reopened cases on less.
This has gotta stop, man.
We keep having the same conversation.
It can't be an accident.
Okay. I'm gonna show you something.
CNN tried to get a hold of this.
We eighty-sixed it out of respect to the family.
The footage?
It's not easy to watch.
I want to see it.
She tripped. Or jumped.
She didn't jump.
Here it is, frame by frame.
Now, there were two witnesses.
One was a  year-old woman with macular degeneration.
All she saw was a blur.
The second was the conductor of the train.
He said it looked like she fell.
I mean between those two and this video, that's all there is.
You can watch it a million times, but this case is closed.

import tariffs on industrial manufactured goods
and export quotas on rare earth elements.
They're using both as political levers.
I agree these are two areas where we can make meaningful progress.
But I'm worried about the rise in corporate cyber attacks.
That's a rabbit hole.
Well, we have to address it sooner or later.
It's just a matter of whether we want to address it now.
The Chinese don't like surprises.
All I'm proposing
is that we use the Joint Commission talks to bring it up gently now,
set the stage for the next round.
Look, I'm a businessman, not a diplomat.
But I'm a businessman with  years experience working in China.
When they come to the table, you don't get greedy.
You're working on a co-venture refinery project in Fujian.
Which would be the first of its kind.
Open the gateway for increased investment   
Cyber attacks threaten those co-ventures.
There's less a need for them
if the Chinese can obtain new technology from corporate espionage.
Frank, what do you think?
I lean more toward Raymond's thinking.
If we antagonize the Chinese we could undo years of progress.
Allow me to do this quietly, with a soft touch.
I won't antagonize them, sir.
The last thing we want to do is rock the boat.
What do you have in mind, Catherine?
A suggested agenda.
Not a demand.
We'll keep it mid-level. I won't get anywhere near it.
Raymond?
I've voiced my concerns.
  A very soft touch.   You have my word, sir.
Good.
Raymond? Want to grab some lunch?
Would love to.
Thanks, Frank. Welcome to the West Wing.
Thank you, sir.
The president is like a lone tree in an empty field.
He leans whichever way the wind is blowing.
And right now Raymond Tusk blows far too strong from the west.
Is that a wig?
No. He's been growing it out for months.
Diane says she likes it long.
I told her she'll feel differently
once she sees the first dread lock.
Or smells it.
I went to see your daughter last weekend.
How is she?
  You want to see a picture?   Okay.
  Was her mother there?   Yeah.
Are they okay on money?
The rate at Greenwoods is going up in January.
Catalina is worried she's gonna be short.
I'll make sure to put more into the account.
We don't have to talk about her if you don't...
No, no, no. It's fine. I appreciate you going to see her.
I'm sorry, Ted.
I thought that when you asked me to lunch it was because you want   
No, no, no. I mean, yes,
I want to make sure they have what they need.
But, no,
the reason I wanted to talk   
Lorrie Tate.
Lorrie's a friend of mine. What about her?
She mentioned you're interested in the whip's race.
Oh, no.
I wish she hadn't.
Why not?
Because it's ridiculous.
Is it?
I just mentioned it off-hand.
The whole Webb and Buchwalter thing is just   
Complete mess.
But I wasn't serious.
I think you should be serious.
Do you want to do it?
I don't have the experience, Ted. And I    I   
Yes or no?
Yes, of course.
Someday.
But now I    I don't have the money they do.
Unless you use mine.
You can't waste your money on   
If I funnel my PAC money
to some folks who are on the fence,
round up a couple dozen commitments before you announce,
that would make you an instant contender.
Now tell me that's a waste.
We're talking hundreds of thousands.
It's not a Christmas present, Jackie.
With you as whip I have a strong ally in the leadership.
I stand to gain as much as you.
Hang on one second.
I don't know where the...
How did it go? Did he buy it?
Whatever bug you put in his ear burrowed deep.
It was easy. The man adores you like you're his own child.
But you sure as hell better make me Chief Deputy.
I need to win first.
Ted and I make two.  to go.
It's always good when the Chief Deputy knows her arithmetic.
Fuck off. Let's start taking names.
This one seems promising.
Connor Ellis. He's solid. Good experience.
Oh, he's the one that got Senator Jones out of that mess,
with the push polling.
Yes. Kept him from the ethics committee.
Let's set up an interview.
I'll find a good time in schedule.
Let's talk about the schedule.
I think we need to be more selective with the events I do.
Some of these are leftovers from Mrs. Matthews.
We can cancel whatever you like.
And what's this?
Your husband will be pinning stars on two newly commissioned Marine generals.
I think that's one you should do.
Okay. Walk me through it.
The generals are Alicia Hampton
and Dalton McGinnis.

Dalton McGinnis?
Yes. Do you know him?
We went to college together.
I'm sorry, where were we?
Arrive what time?
Great. I'd like a list of all the people that will be attending.
It's not that big a deal if I get left out,
but you're the secretary of state.
I mean, Tusk should not be determining policy.
The president alone should instruct you on what you are to pursue.
What's their relationship?
He's had his ear for years.
An advisor...
More of a mentor. And one whose advice is not easily dismissed.
He's gonna keep pushing back on cyber warfare.
Not if I get it on the agenda.
No, especially if you get it on the agenda.
Tusk is not gonna take any chances
when the next Joint Commission talks come around.
You agreed with him in the meeting.
If we had ganged up, he would have taken a firmer position.
For all we know,
he's convincing the president right now to change his mind.
Now we need to remove that option as a possibility.
How?
Force the Chinese to confront the issue now, this round of talks.
I promised the president a soft touch.
I can't intentionally break my promise.
What if it was unintentional?
Cathy, if you don't like how the table is set,
turn over the table.
You're cheating.
No, I'm not. It's vapor.
Still.
You should try it.
Addiction without the consequences.
It's all yours.
You staying up?
This ceremony tomorrow night.
You don't want to go.
If I don't have to.
I hate these sorta things, too.
But it is my first public appearance as vice president.
Okay.
Thank you.
Should we turn this into a proper office?
That's not a bad idea. No privacy downstairs.
I'll talk to the contractor.
Goodnight, Francis.
Goodnight.
Sir! Sir! Congressional Record.
Weren't the talks supposed to go until six?
We can't talk if they won't listen.
Did the Chinese walk out?
We made it clear that we won't discuss any other issues
until government-sponsored cyber attacks are on the table.
Apparently that's not what they wanted to hear.
Sir, what did you tell the Chinese delegation before they walked out?
We didn't have anybody there.
The Joint Commission is usually a snooze-fest.
Not today it wasn't.
I've got Greer on it.
Isn't this international?
We need somebody from the tech beat
if we want any background on cyber warfare.
Does he have anybody on record yet?
The Chinese aren't talking.
And all the U.S. delegation said is what's in the AP wire.
I want something online in the next two hours.
In-depth follow-up sometime this week.
Hey, Lucas?
You all right?
Yeah. Why?
You're wearing the same clothes you wore yesterday.
Am I?
I don't know what's going on in your personal life,
but it seems to be entering the workplace.
Appearances matter.
And we can't have an editor looking more disheveled
than his reporters.
Two hours. You'll have something.
Did you know Jackie Sharp's running for Whip?
No, this is the first I'm hearing of it.
I spoke to Webb.
He got an email from Lorrie Tate about me.
I got one from Dave Holland about him.
Which means nothing to me.
The junkets, the nepotism. Tate and Sharp are close.
Holland serves on the VA committee with her.
She used proxies to insulate herself.
So you think that she gave the dirt to them.
Yeah. She's been playing both of us.
How many commitments do you think she could have?
Around  so far.
So she's a distant third.
But she's picking people off us left and right.
I want your help.
You have my support, Wes.
Then make that public.
If I come out for you, Birch comes out for Webb.
That's gonna hurt you, not help you.
This is serious, Frank.
Ted Havemeyer is bankrolling her.
Have you thought of talking to Jackie?
No, no. I can't do that on principle.
Why not?
Anyone who Havemeyer is backing, I don't work with.
He pulled the same crap on me when I ran for Senate.
He financed my primary opponent. Asshole.
Well, that is your call.
But if you're gonna let an old grudge get in the way of progress   
I just can't do it, Frank.
Havemeyer's been trying to shove me down the totem pole for years.
I won't give him the satisfaction.
Well, I can respect that, but my hands are tied.
It's a delicate matter,
but we are in communication with the Chinese government
as to how to move forward.
Does this mean the U.S. will back down on cyber attacks?
The United States never backs down,
particularly on issues that are high priority to us.
Madam Secretary, what did you  
Thank you.
What did you tell the head of the delegation?
The delegation overstepped its bounds,
but Cathy couldn't throw her own people under the bus.
She should have consulted us first before speaking publicly.
The press was on her doorstep
and the president was in another hemisphere.
Now, look, I'm not condemning what she did,
but she had to do something.
She made a gut call and she acted.
We have to distance ourselves from this.
When is the president back?
Tomorrow morning.
Can we set up a meeting?
Cathy needs to publicly apologize.
Can we get her in the room with the president?
Shouldn't we all be on the same page first?
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.
Now, you asked me a question before I went and got my food.
Mr. Vice President. General McGinnis.
it's a great honor. I hope you don't mind.
The president wishes he could be here. He's asked me to fill in.
The honor is mine, sir.
And, General, this is my wife, Claire.
It's good to see you, Claire. It's been a long time.
Yes.
Harvard. We were classmates.
Claire didn't say a thing.
We dated for a time.
About five minutes.
Anyway, I'll let you get back to your meal.
Thank you. I've remembered.
Interestingly enough,
in South Carolina the largest crop is not cotton.
No. It's tobacco.
And the third-largest crop is marijuana.
Now    we'll just keep that to ourselves.
Would you all excuse me for just a moment?
  Is she alone?   Yes.
Would you give us a few moments, please?
What's wrong?
It was him.
Who?
Freshman year.
You mean... McGinnis?
Francis, Francis. Please, don't do anything.
I am not gonna pin a medal on that   
You have to.
Just a minute, please! There is no way that man   
Sir, they want to start the ceremony.
Just a minute, please! He does not deserve a medal..
Francis. I beg of you.
I'm telling you, that man deserves to be taken out and shot.
I am begging you.
  No.   Please!
  No.   Do not   
I said just a minute!
Do not make a scene. Please.
Tom.
Thanks for coming by.
You know, I thought I would miss this place the moment I stepped inside.
But I don't.
Hope you like Stella.
Cheers.
Beers up.
How are things?
They're good. They're good.
You're happy?
I haven't been happy a day in my life.
But I have time now.
To think. To write. Been working on a novel.
Yeah?
It's absolute shit. That's okay.
That's great, Tom. That's really great.
What's on your mind?
I know you didn't ask me here just to catch up.
Frank Underwood.
On the president's behalf
it is my great honor to formerly recognize the selection
of General Alicia Hampton as Commander,
United States European Command,
and General Dalton McGinnis
as Commander of the United States Strategic Command.
The United States Marine Corps has been well served
by these two exemplary leaders.
The president and I are grateful for their continued service.
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
You think I'm insane?
I don't think you're insane.
I think you've been through a lot.
Trying to make sense of it all.
I know I'm right.
I'm sure I believe you are.
It's a fact that he helped cover up the DUI.
Imagine if one of your reporters came to you with this story.
Could you print a word of it?
No, but I'd have them keep digging.
Would you?
If you're honest with yourself,
wouldn't you tell them it seemed farfetched?
Your notes aren't convincing.
The police reports don't prove a link.
  And the speculative leaps you're making...   I know.
Hold yourself to the same standards as you hold your staff.
You and Zoe were seeing each other.
I    I'm assuming. Maybe I'm wrong.
We    we were.
When I lost my first wife, it didn't add up.
Who dies of breast cancer at ?
I wanted to sue. Doctors, the hospital, everyone.
Thought they were hiding something.
No.
Grief demands an answer, but sometimes there isn't one.
Her life couldn't be saved. Period.
What do I do?
Would you consider seeing someone?
There's a therapist who helped me a great deal when Cynthia passed away.
I can put you in touch   
No. I don't need to see somebody.
Lucas.
I appreciate you coming by, Tom.
Thanks for the beer.
You call me anytime.
You take care of yourself, Lucas.
I mean it.
Any plans to go elsewhere, sir?
No. We're in for the night. Thank you.
Yes, sir.
I'm tired.
Do you need something, sir?
Uh, my remote. I want to play.
It's right over here.
Thank you.
Is there something wrong with the Internet? I can't get online.
We had to disable the access.
It's not a secure connection.
Could you just give me a moment, please?
Whenever you're out here, somebody needs to be with you.
I can't be alone in my own backyard?
If it were up to me, sir. But it's not up to me.
Okay, Meechum.
You think I don't want to smash things?
I know what that anger is more than you can imagine.
When he was on top of me   
We don't have to talk about it.
No, I want to.
When he was on top of me, I pressed my hand   
with everything I could I pressed it into his face.
I pressed it so hard I broke his nose.
That didn't stop him.
He shoved the sheets in my mouth.
I could barely breathe.
Every time I think of her
pinned down like that
I strangle her, Francis,
so she doesn't strangle me.
I have to. We have to.
The alternative is   
it's unlivable.
You should go to sleep.
I'm not sure if I can.
Then you should go back downstairs.
You'll still feel the hate in the morning.
You'll use that. But not on him.
What did you communicate, exactly?
I told him to bring up the agenda,
suggest bullet points for the SED, but make no demands.
And how did that translate into a direct ultimatum?
Well, sometimes my delegates try to read between the lines.
They know that I need plausible deniability for diplomatic purposes.
Why didn't you immediately recant?
In my experience with the Chinese,
backpedaling makes us look weak.
Lose face or exhibit strength.
I chose the latter.
All right, Catherine. I'll be in touch shortly.
Thank you, sir.
Get me Raymond on the private line.
Do you think she overstepped on purpose?
Cathy would never disobey your orders. Not on purpose.
Raymond, I've got Frank here.
Just the three of us?
Just us three. Morning, Raymond.
My contacts in Beijing
tell me the minister of commerce is in a tizzy.
Wants to use this as an excuse to start clenching fists.
Well, either I turn my back on Cathy or I stand behind her.
It's gotta be the former.
I agree.
If you don't apologize,
you go from ruffling feathers to plucking them.
And the Chinese won't stand for that, Mr. President.
What about perceived miscommunication between me and my cabinet?
Mr. President, right now the goal is to resume the talks.
I wouldn't worry about perceptions.
Frank is right. We need to be pragmatic.
Worry about appearances later.
All right. I'll have Catherine draft an apology.
No, it has to come from you, Mr. President.
If the apology is to mean anything,
it must come from the White House.
That is certainly the more likely to succeed.
Fine. I'll do it then. Thank you, Raymond.
Thank you, Garrett.
Do you hear how he still uses the president's given name?
And that Walker doesn't flinch at the lack of respect it implies.
Sir, forgive me if this isn't the case,
but you seem a bit hesitant.
Why do you say that?
Well, you've raised a good point about public perception.
I don't want you to think that
I'm dismissing your concerns casually.
No. It's a concern for you, too?
There is some insight into what Cathy brought up.
Backpedalling is weakness.
Well, it's always a coin toss with the Chinese.
But sometimes standing your ground is better than giving in.
They respect you more when you show strength.
Are you changing your mind on this, Frank?
I just think it's important that you do what you think is best.
The American people voted you president.
Not me. Not Raymond Tusk.
I'll let you know what I decide.
Thank you, sir.
You think she's Underwood's choice?
He deflected, so it's possible.
You and I,
we need to work together on this, Wes.
Before we both get screwed.
I agree.
One of us drops out,
throws support to the other.
That'll dwarf any following she has.
You want me to drop out.
I'll make sure you get my chairmanship on appropriations.
All you can offer me is, uh, Ethics, which nobody wants.
Let's put this to bed, Wes.
Webb must have offered him a deal.
Then we have to offer a better one.
I'm guessing appropriations. There's no way I can top that.
Except for ways and means.
I    I won't let you give your chair to an ass like Buchwalter.
If you're the Whip,
you outrank him and every other chairman.
Screw committees.
I'll have a direct line to the speaker.
Don't be stubborn, Jackie.
You think he'd take it?
He was willing to take a deal from Webb.
But you're the only person he hates more.
He's a brute. But he's not an idiot.
Well, I know you're not refusing out of loyalty.
True.
So it's because of Ted.
You think you are hot shit, don't you?
Can we set egos aside and talk business like the adults we are?
I want more than ways and means.
Tell me.
I want Havemeyer gone. Not just retired....
Politically dead.
That race was  years ago.
That was  years I could have been in the Senate.
Revenge? Really?
Not revenge.
Equity.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Buchwalter won't budge.
You know, there's nothing I despise more in life than pettiness.
I could approach Webb, but I don't have enough to offer him.
Ah, he'd never drop out. Too much pride.
I'm not sure what to do.
This is my file on Ted. An illegitimate daughter.
The nanny, of course.
Her name is Emily Rodriguez. .
Cerebral palsy.
I know about Emily.
Well, then why are we having this conversation?
It's complicated.
The daughter? It's very black and white to me.
I've known Ted since I was born.
He and my father were very close.
Yeah, I'm aware.
He's always looked out for me.
He got me into West Point. He funded my first race.
I like Ted. He's always been a team player.
It's unfortunate he has this secret.
It was a mistake. One he's always regretted.
After she was born he asked me to check in on her,
because he couldn't. Because he trusted me.
I see.
You came in here knowing what you had to do,
hoping I would pull a rabbit out of a hat so you wouldn't have to.
I know the girl.
I know her mother. These people don't deserve this.
I've given you all I can.
Whatever you decide is your prerogative.
But maybe I misjudged you.
Ted is family to me.
An adopted daughter in lieu of a real one.
Sir, the secretary is here.
Thank you. Send her in. Excuse us.
It's good.
Not too long?
A little bit, but not much.
This part, three paragraphs in.
Oh, about the phone companies?
Tell me more.
It's one of Homeland Security's major concerns.
That the cyber attacks might infiltrate phone carriers,
get access to millions of people's data history.
Like who they called?
Yeah, who they called, texted,
what they texted,
when, where they were. Everything.
And that's possible?
There haven't been any catastrophic breaches yet.
At least not reported.
But it looks like the Chinese are starting to
recruit mercenaries on the Deep Web
to launch guerilla-type attacks that can't be tracked back   
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. The Deep Web. I've heard of that.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No,   of the internet isn't accessible
through standard search engines. Most of it's useless.
But it's where you go to find anything and everything.
Child porn, Bitcoin laundering, mail-order narcotics,
hackers for hire.
How do you access it?
It's actually pretty easy. I could show you if you want.
Yeah, I'm curious.
Mind if I...?
Go ahead.
Okay, first thing you need is TOR.
Some people prefer IP, but I think TOR is better.
What is TOR?
It protects you through proxy servers. Keeps you anonymous.
Then I'll show you how to get to
the posting boards and the IRCs.
Be careful what you click.
Some crazy shit there, man.
For too long, uh, we've, uh,
danced on egg shells regarding the issue of cyber warfare.
Now, Secretary Durant
acted on instructions that came directly from me.
Now, if the Chinese are not willing to
engage in a meaningful dialogue
about intellectual property of American corporations
as well as this deliberate targeting
of our government's online infrastructure,
well then that is proof of a double-standard mentality
that we shall no longer tolerate.
Our delegation to the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade
was unfairly accused and defamed
by representatives of the United States government.
The People's Republic of China
will not be threatened
by derisive and unsubstantiated claims.
As long as the White House continues to behave this way,
any future bilateral trade talks will be impossible.
It caught me by surprise, too.
Did you say anything to him after I hung up yesterday?
No. Have you spoken to him?
Yeah, a few minutes ago.
He said he did what he thought was right.
Well, there's nothing we can do to combat that.
He doesn't usually go against my advice
without giving me fair warning.
What are you suggesting, Raymond?
He's easily manipulated.
Clearly not in this case.
We need to fix this. And I'm counting on you for that, Frank.
Let me freshen your memory. I don't owe you any favors.
I promised to work with you, not for you.
And when it comes to China, we both want the same thing.
So we need to work together.
To convince Garrett he should retract.
To support the president in the path that he's chosen.
While he continues to antagonize them publicly.
While he continues to benefit from a bump in approval ratings.
A tough stance on China is popular.
And we can use that to our advantage.
Let's just be patient
and see if we can smooth things over from back channels.
If I don't see any results, you won't have my patience for long.
That's understood.
Let me know what Durant has to say.
Absolutely.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
I thought he might balk at taking a handout from me.
I'd call it more than a handout.
Well, he's always been the sort of man
who could be bought, but never cheaply.
It's not the chairmanship that bought him, Ted.
What do you mean?
I'm telling you this
so that you have time to call your wife
and prepare your statement.
What's my out? What does he want from me?
There is no out. He wants it to hurt.
You told him.
I just promised him that I could make it happen.
You can't do this, Jackie.
The story's breaking tomorrow.
What part of it?
No names. Just that you have a daughter.
Have you thought about what this will do to Diane? To our sons?
I hate myself for it.
But I'll get over that.
What about her?
Emily. You can't even say her name, can you?
Don't lecture me.
You've never been in the same room with her.
She's had the best treatment available.
Alone. Hooked up to machines.
Surrounded by nurses who punch out at dinnertime.
You don't know what I've been through.
You? What about her?
I can't do more than I've done.
That's bullshit, Ted. You could've found a way.
I won't defend myself to you.
Don't. Save that for your wife.
This isn't to punish you, Ted.
It's    it's simpler than that.
When I first encouraged you to run for office,
it's because I sensed how unstoppable you were.
But I never thought I'd have to lie down on the tracks myself.
If you're going to put my neck in the noose,
look me in the eye while you do it.
I'm very grateful for all that you've done for me.
You'll make an excellent whip, Jacqueline.
Now please get out of my office.
What are you doing?
It's finally quiet.
It is, isn't it?
We have our fortress now.
Where are you coming from?
My new office. They just finished setting it up today.
Do you like it?
It's an office. It's fine.House.of.Cards.SE
Raising the age of retirement
is an unacceptable erosion of the American Dream.
If the Republicans fail to pass a reasonable Omnibus package
by demanding entitlement reform,
they will force the federal government into a spending freeze.
The frostbite will be on their hands. Not ours.
Do you think that's a bit much? The frostbite bit?
Well, it's the State of the Union, sir.
We want to appeal to the flyover states.
They'll like that line.
I want something more forceful.
Blood on their hands?
No.
Throw us back into the ice age.
I like that, Christina. Let's try that.
Linda. Christina, you come up here, too.
There are two types of vice presidents.
Doormats and matadors.
Which do you think I intend to be?
Raymond.
He's hung up on the domestic agenda.
Not a single word about China.
His instincts are right.
If the government shuts down one day after the speech,
not a single word in the speech matters.
We have to address the freeze now.
China comes later.
Both parties have been wrangling over entitlements for months.
What makes you think a miracle
is gonna happen in the next three days?
We give the Republicans exactly what they want.
Retirement age?
Yes.
That's a line in the sand we cannot cross.
We will cross it eventually, so why keep fighting it?
I can push this through the Senate.
And once I do, the president will announce
a major bipartisan agreement in the State of the Union.
We avoid a government shutdown,
and the White House gets credit.
It's a huge risk.
And if it fails, a huge embarrassment.
The embarrassment will be entirely my own.
This is on my shoulders.
Even so, the president is gonna require some serious persuasion.
I'm happy to talk to him.
No. No. I'll do it.
He'll be more amenable if it comes from a friend.
You're right. A trusted confidant.
Let me test the waters.
The Cult of Tusk. Membership: one.
But that one disciple just so happens to be
the most powerful man in the free world.
For now.
The entitlements. Raising the age of eligibility to .
Your people will never go for it.
They will if the leadership does.
And the leadership will.
They fought us on this since I was in diapers.
Assuming that I can get this past my people and convince them,
can you convince yours?
It's a tough sell.
You're the Senate majority leader, Hector.
You don't have to sell. You can dictate.
What do you want in return?
A working government. We stave off the freeze.
You won on education.
We confirmed you as vice president.
The Republicans need a win, Frank.
And that's what I'm offering.
You get a win on entitlements.
We avoid a shutdown.
Everyone gets points for bipartisanship.
You know who I'm worried about.
Curtis Haas.
He's a troublemaker, Frank.
Who controls a third of your caucus.
And he'll never go for this.
He wants to see the Democrats suffer.
Just bring him to the table.
That's all I'm asking.
Miss Gallagher? My name is Lucas Goodwin.
I'm a deputy editor at the Washington Herald.
Mr. Goodwin, please.
Just a few moments. That's all I'm asking.
If I wanted to talk to you, I would have returned your calls.
Did you read my emails?
Yes. Which is why I didn't call.
Give me a chance to walk you through it.
I have to get back to the White House.
  I'm sorry.   Peter Russo was killed.
Let go.
So was Zoe Barnes. I was working with her.
Stop and listen   
Frank Underwood is the one who did this.
Listen! This is nuts.
The DUI. The brack hearing. All of it was part of   
This has to stop. Okay?
Did Underwood talk to you?
  Tell you not to speak with anybody?   No.
Doug Stamper?
Whatever you think happened,
whatever compelled you to stalk me like this   
You're the only person who might know something,
who could understand.
I've got    I've got no one else I can talk   
I don't understand. And I don't want to.
Okay? There's no story here.
Please, just five minutes.
Just think about what you're doing.
Waiting outside of a building   
Peter would still be alive if it wasn't for Frank Underwood.
I've worked really hard to put Peter behind me.
So if I see you again, if I hear from you again,
I'll not only contact the police,
I'll let the vice president know what you're saying about him,
and then you can deal with the Secret Service, too.
It's the usual overseas chatter. Bit of a bum in China,
but we chalk that up to the trade tensions.
Secret Service.
Average number of death threats to both POTUS and the VP.
We passed them along to our dear friends at the FBI.
FBI?
The FBI confirms the level of activity
of our dear friends at the Secret Service.
We followed up on everything. No high-level threats.
So nothing we need to report directly
to the president or vice president?
  No.   Thank you, gentlemen.
The email you sent. Has anyone else seen it?
Except for the agent that alerted me, no.
Other agencies might have stumbled upon this.
Even so, they probably ignored it.
Any idea who's making the posts?
Deep Web forums.
Almost impossible to trace. Lone wolf most likely.
I want you to find him.
We need a direct threat to life.
The vice president just assumed office.
I can't have this conspiracy stuff going mainstream.
  This sort of thing usually fizzles out      I can't take the chance.
I want you to find him and put him away.
  He hasn't committed a crime.   But he wants to.
So help him.
That requires manpower.
You've got men.
It exposes me, Doug.
I've always kept you informed because you're an old pal
and I trust you. But...
We're talking about an operation.
I'm an old pal who now works at the White House.
Between old pals,
I've been stuck as the executive liaison for way too long.
How worried are you
that a mass shooting could happen in a school in your community?
Great deal, somewhat, not so much,
not at all, unsure?
You sound hot. Are you hot?
Sir...
Somewhat hot? A great deal hot?
Lynchburg Children's, Pediatric Division.
Can I talk to Cheryl Posner?
Sorry. She's on duty right now.
It's her daughter.
Hold on one moment.
Rachel? Rachel?
Sweetheart, are you there? Please, do  
Hello?
Hello, Mr. Jay.
My name is Rachel
and I'm calling on behalf of the National Firearm Education Center.
Would you be able to speak with me briefly
regarding firearm legislation and Second Amendment legislation?
So, you're Willa's top choice.
Why should you be my husband's and my top choice?
Over the past  years
the two of you combined have gotten less coverage
than the average junior congressman from Nebraska.
Well, we don't seek the spotlight.
I'm not suggesting you should.
But am I correct in assuming
that your husband will be an active vice president?
It's harder to keep an active VP out of the press than in it,
but it's possible if we give the media just enough
to keep them from starving.
Where'd you grow up, Connor?
Texas. Just like you.
Dallas?
Lubbock.
I had a much thicker accent to get rid of you than y'all.
How do you know I had one?
Your first joint interview,
when your husband was running for state assembly in '.
That's on the internet?
No. No. I contacted the local affiliate in Greenville.
They wouldn't send me the tapes via mail,
so I went down there and watched in their vault.
To South Carolina?
When I want a job, I do my homework.
I look forward to seeing what you come up with.
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.
Thursday.
I don't see how this is a victory for us.
Our choices are the freeze,
which the Democrats get blamed for, or   
Not necessarily. The Republi  
No, which we definitely get blamed for.
  Or we offer them      Entitlements, Frank?
We took a stand. We can't turn back now.
I'd rather see the government grind to a halt.

"Democrat Leadership Enacts Entitlement Reform, Staves Off Freeze."
We show unity. We offer progress.
Let's convert some lifelong conservatives.
You have Mendoza's assurance he'll work with us?
I do.
I don't want to put our necks out there
just to have the guillotine fall.
You won't. My neck will be right out there with you.
Francis faints at the sight of blood.
He'd never let them break the skin.
To unity.
No, no, no, no, no. Come on.
Larry, can you come by?
Something weird's going on with my computer.
Thanks.
Come on!
Hey, what's the problem?
Nothing. It's fine. Uh, I fixed it.
Okay. Cool.
It's not as progressive as I'd like.
You mean radical.
Raising retirement age to  makes entitlements solvent until .
And it saves us over a trillion dollars
without a single penny of taxpayer income.
And I'd like to eliminate early retirement.
Entirely?
Forget it.
What about  and ?
I have a responsibility to my constituents.
I promised I wouldn't waver when it comes to things   
Are we really going to allow the Tea Party to determine fiscal legislation?,
I've never been beholden to the Tea Party.
Come on, Curtis.
You wouldn't have won reelection
if their PACs hadn't dumped  million into your campaign.
If their definition of budgetary conservatism
happens to overlap with mine, that's a function  
Curtis. Curtis. Let's show some goodwill.
Can you stomach  and ?
Effective immediately?
Five years from now.
Not interested.
Well, you know we can't throw this on people without any warning.
They need some time to digest.
I'm sorry. I just can't do it.
Okay. Meet with your staff. Consult with your colleagues.
I'll consult with mine. And let's talk tomorrow.
All right. I can agree to that.
But this is a good first step.
How do we make sure Curtis can't filibuster
when we get the amendment passed?
Assuming we do.
Between you and me, I'm sure we can turn him around.
I just want to be on the safe side.
We make sure the passage of the amendment
constitutes the passage of the bill.
By previous agreement.
Yeah, that's right. We pass the amendment,
and then we're done. Wham, bam.
Can we put that in writing?
Have Erikson reach out to me.
Muchos gracias.
There you go.
Lucas Goodwin?
Good evening, Lucas.
Speak into the microphone.
Who are you?
Go to the home screen. Open the other app.
Tell me who you are.
You've done your research. You know who I am.
I    I know who you claim to be.
And if you're not convinced by now, goodbye.
Wait.
All right, I'm on the home screen.
Open the notary app.
What is this?
To ensure you aren't law enforcement.
I'm    I'm not.
Then sign.
How?
Hold your thumb to the camera and press "Capture."
How do I know you're not law enforcement?
Sign the document or walk away.
All right. I did it.
Press "Send."
Where is this going?
I'm VPNing through Iran and  other countries.
Don't worry. It's secure.
Now, one last thing.
I need the two-step verification code
for the Herald's internal servers.
I    I don't    I don't even know how to do that.
Yes, you do. Check your email.
Destroy the iPad, especially the serial number
and delete the email after you've memorized it.
Good luck.
Hello?
Raymond, are you there?
Yeah.
Sorry, Frank. I    I thought I saw an Inca dove.
Must have flown the wrong direction for winter.
It sounds windy. Where are you?
Top of my building. Got a bird feeder up here.
Nice work with the President. I hear we have a green light.
He pushed back in the beginning, but yeah.
His writers are reworking the speech now.
I'm very close to a deal.   in five years.
Spending cuts as discussed.
Is that rock solid?
Soon as we shake hands.
What's the hold-up?
Curtis Haas, which isn't a surprise.
I'm meeting with him soon. He's the final hurdle.
Cutting it pretty close, Frank.
Well, this is    this is historic.
The Republicans have wanted entitlement reform since Johnson.
Curtis will come around.
In the meantime we should get the new retirement age into the speech.
I would stay away from the specifics, Frank.
I mean, I   even if it passes, the House might  
I know the House better
than you know birds, Raymond.
Believe me when I say they'll pass the Senate version.
I'll talk to the President.
Just make sure this is airtight.
Thank you. What is it?
Lucas Goodwin.
From the Herald.
He must have been working with Zoe.
How much does he know?
No more than she did.
She knew enough.
I'm on it, sir.
Proof?
Not yet.
Jesus, Doug.
It's under control. I just thought you should be aware.
I'm juggling the President, the Republicans, Tusk.
  I can't      And you should stay focused on that.
Goodwin's on my plate. Not yours.
It wasn't until the th century
that the notion of noble objectivism came into the forefront.
But facts are facts.
is shown asking how a grocery scanner works,
and he gets nailed for it.
Fact? They were showing him a new model.
He was asking how the new one was different than the old one.
Curiosity, not ignorance.
But the lack of context told a more powerful narrative.
There is no arrangement of facts
that is, uh, purely objective.
We can finally do something. We have the means to act.
Some teenage pimple-faced hacker   
This was a sophisticated infiltration.
It's not the work of a child.
Look. Here's the email.
Hieronymus Bot.,
The FBI's been hunting him for years.
Lucas, listen to me   
If we get these records,
I'll need your help tracking timelines,
piecing together the chronology of the   
No. You want somebody to hold your hand
and say it's okay to go on this fucking goose chase.
You shouldn't be teaching in Ithaca. You're better than that.
  You should be back home      I belong here.
Droning on to a bunch of hungover English majors?
Exactly.
You're wrong about the truth. There is objective truth.
He killed her.
You know it's a fact.
Here's a fact.
My mom has ,  years left at best.
I've seen her more in the past month than since I left for school.
It's simpler here. It's quiet.
I need that. She needs me.
I'm sorry, Lucas.
I'm sorry that night how I reacted.
I'm sorry you lost your girlfriend.
I'm sorry the world is this fucked up.
I really am.
But I can't help you.
Where's everyone else?
I did you a disservice yesterday.
We shouldn't have put you on the spot in front of all the leadership.
Have a seat, Curtis.
We know that you have an obligation to take a firm stance,
but entitlement reform is something you ran on,
and now it's within your grasp.
So tell us your fears.
That the Democrats get another win.
We suffer in the midterms,
and the next Congress dismantles the agreement.
You think we're being disingenuous.
My constituents don't trust the administration.
I can't have them thinking the wool's been pulled over our eyes.
As I suspected. Hector?

We include a super majority point of order
against revisiting the issue for  years.
You have it in black and white.
A serious, long-term commitment with no opportunity to dismantle.
And that's on top of everything else we asked for.
VA services and FEMA stay at current levels.
Everything else at  to  percent of the cuts you propose.
You get your win, Curtis.
We just avoid disaster.
Maybe the country needs to see what disaster looks like.
The Tea Party has a strong voice, and you're its bullhorn.
Show your people that voice can translate into law
and not just add to the noise.
Okay.
And if the House fails to pass the bill after we do,
you go on record blaming your own party for the gridlock.
I believe we have a deal.
What are you listening to?
I'm sorry. I'll turn...
No, it's nice. Can I listen?
My ears are clean. I promise.
Thanks.
  It's beautiful.   Yeah.
It's so sad.
It helps me relax.
Long day?
I work at a call center.
So, yeah.  strangers an hour.
I'll leave you alone.
You probably don't want to talk to another one.
It    it's all right. As long as you don't hang up on me.
Do you ever just talk to them? The strangers?
We're not allowed to.
All I would want to do is ask them about who they are.
What about you? What do you do?
I, um, I work at the bookstore and the daycare center.
I had that same look on my face the first time
somebody handed me one of those.
Yeah, I'm    I'm just    I'm not religious.
Just keep it. Check it out, or don't.
We've got really good music there.
I'm    thank you.
The House sent a bill to the Senate.
What Frank wants to send back bears zero resemblance.
Because it's bipartisan. Unlike ours.
That sounds like something Frank would say.
I'm not Frank.
He has a desk in your office.
If this bill passes in the Senate   
It won't.
We should be prepared, Bob.
Well, I'm prepared to wait and see.
Have a good afternoon, ladies.
"Ladies"?
He's threatened.
He's a pig.
Give him time.
He used to have two white middle-aged guys at his side.
Now he's got a black guy and a woman  years his junior.
Who knows how to shoot a rifle.
We just need to keep at him.
Yes?
Catalina Rodriguez is on line four.
Give me a moment.
Catalina.
Ted told me it was you.
You there?
Yes, I'm here.
The press won't leave us alone.
For weeks they're showing up,
trying to get pictures of me and Emily.
It wasn't me.
You're the only one who knew.
I do   I don't know how the story got out.
Why would Ted lie abut that?
I don't know. Maybe    maybe he's ashamed.
So what do I do? When will they leave us alone?
I    I don't know, Catalina.
I can't live like this.
I'm s   I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.
How    how is Emily doing?
Catalina?
He's very confident.
Yeah, but does he have what it takes?
We'll see when I get his media plan.
What about his personality?
Charming. Direct. Very thorough.
He found our first interview together, in '.
I would love to see that. Does he have a copy?
I don't think so. The TV station made him watch it there.
We should screen that for the president and the first lady.
Show 'em how it's done.
Christina...
What about her?
Have you noticed anything strange between her and the president?
How do you mean?
I passed them in the hall yesterday.
And they seem    I don't know    very intimate.
They did seem cozy at the prep session.
Do you think...?
No. Not necessarily.
An interesting thought, though.
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
We're having lunch.
The Republicans are backing out.
Mendoza's chief of staff just gave me the heads-up.
Get Mendoza on the phone.
It's Curtis Haas. He got cold feet.
Cages. It's really kinda like but,
you know, people look at 'em. It's kind of fun.
I got your email.
Now good for you?
Yeah, sure. Can I call you right back?
What exactly did you need to know?
We're doing some follow-up pieces on the cyber warfare thing.
I just wanted to get a layman's understanding
of how the Chinese might get through a firewall.
It's a bit complicated, but I could show you the basics.
That's all I need.
We use a standard N-tier architecture.
Think of it like a big sandwich with layers of bread.
Between each is the lettuce, the tomato, the roast beef, whatever.
What I'm pulling up here is the org code,
which, uh, separates the database   
Shit. I forgot there's a meeting with sales in a couple minutes.
You want to do this later?
No. I'll just run over
and let them know I'll be a few minutes late. Be right back.
Cool. I'll be here.
Okay.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
There.
Come on.
Okay.
Go.
Something wrong?
Can't find my phone. It    it's weird.
I had it just a minute ago.
Here it is. Sorry about that.
No problem.
So the, uh, N-tier architecture.
The high-tech sandwich I was talking about.
I thought Mendoza was willing to work with us.
He is. The problem is Curtis Haas.
And have you spoken with him?
His office isn't returning our calls.
Neither is Mendoza's   
I should've stuck to my guns.
The vote isn't until tomorrow afternoon.
I'll reach out to Mendoza first thing in the   
This is the State of the Union, Frank.
I won't be left in limbo.
If we need to start rewriting that speech now,
I don't want to waste a minute.
I can turn this around, sir.
You know, Raymond told me this was your idea.
To pursue this compromise.
I suggested it as an option.
He said you bullied him into it,
that he thought it was a    a mistake.
If he felt so strongly, he should have advised you otherwise.
Raymond is not a politician.
He relies on our political expertise
as much as we rely on his business acumen.
Maybe we shouldn't point fingers until there's a problem.
Oh, you wouldn't call this a problem.
Not if it's solved before it becomes one.
You see, I wanted a Vice President who can manage Congress.
Not one who bites off more than he can chew.
Then have faith you made the right choice, sir.
Whatever faith I have is quickly evaporating.
Don't humiliate the administration, Frank.
You're part of it now.
Yes, sir.
We're done.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Give me the private line, please.
Tusk is blocking my way. Goodwin at my heels.
There can be no false steps now.
The higher up the mountain, the more treacherous the path.
Lucas Goodwin went up to visit her.
They may be looking for you.
Nobody's contacted me. I don't think anyone knows I'm here.
Then we need to make sure it stays that way.
Don't speak to anyone you don't have to.
Don't go anywhere you don't need to be.
Tell me you heard what I said.
I heard you. I get it.
I'm fine.
  Put some ice on it.   I said it's okay.
What is this?
What, are you going through my garbage now?
Someone gave it to me on the bus.
You let me know if anyone contacts you.
Sorry I'm late.
No worries.
How much more you want to do right now?
Fill in this area?
Yeah. And, uh, one more poppy down here.
That's a lot for one sitting.
I know.
Okay.
Francis?
You're heading in?
Mendoza's an early riser.
You'll figure this out.
I need to prove what the Vice President is capable of.
Don't prove it to them. Prove it to me.
Curtis has me by the tea bags, Frank.
I don't have a working majority without him.
He wasn't elected leader.
True. But I have to pick my battles.
If you can't control him on budgetary issues   
It's not just him. It's the  senators he has under his thumb.
I won't be the leader next year if they turn on me.
So he wants to be courted. Sit him down   
I already tried talking to him. He wouldn't budge.
Then we'll both talk to him.
He's made his position clear.
We all shook hands at this table.
The most I can do is put the substitute amendment
on the floor with limited debate.
Now, your people can say whatever they want for the record.
But we're gonna vote the amendment down.
I am not interested in symbolic gestures.
That's all I can offer.
Where's your courage?
My power has limits, Frank.
Five Republicans makes you the deciding vote.,
Now, it's highly doubtful
we can get them to vote against their own party.
But they might abstain.
You'd need .
Entitlement is the Republicans' white whale.
I can get at least two of 'em to flip.
And you'd only need six abstaining.
Erikson's already making calls.
Donner?
And Pulaski.
All right. Get me a call list so I can tag-team with him.
Got it right here.
We have to get medieval.
When it comes to parliamentary procedure,
there's not a rule I don't know, sir.
Find me the ones we can bend.
Mark, you're a sensible man.
Yes, I    I know    I understand.
What if    tell you what.
What if both VA hospitals in your district    yes, both of them.
Hold on. Who?
Moriarty.
I promised him an amendment for his bovine research center.
That makes six.
Mark, if I can get you funding for both,
are you with us?
Excellent.
You come by the White House
and have lunch with me sometime soon.
Bye-bye. We have the numbers.
Once you break the quorum call
it's gonna be a little tricky.
Tell me on the way.
Sir. Sir.
  We might not have a majority.   What?
The Dems are poaching people.
Donner, Pulaski. Maybe more.
Voting for the amendment?
Some. Others abstaining. I'm still trying to figure out who.
We need to delay and figure out what the fuck's going on.
Quorum call. There's  hours until the recess.
We call a name an hour.
Mr. Avendale?
Here.
Excuse me. I do believe you're sitting in my chair.
Mr. Drewry, what is the order of business.
We are in a quorum call, sir.
Then why aren't you calling the roll?
We are, sir. In a deliberate manner.
Let's speed it up.
Mr. Brown?
Here.
More expeditious than that.
  Mr. Burr?   Here.
  Ms. Cantwell?   Here.
Mr. Cerini?
Check.
Cornwall?
Here.
Mr. Colson?
Ms. Douster
Here.
They have a quorum. We don't have the numbers.
Out. Let's get all our people out.
  Mr. Demerell. Mr. Darling.   Here.
  Mr. Daswani.   Here.
  Mr. Donner.   Faster.
Mr. Dobben, Mr. Dwyer.
  Erinburgh, Engel, Erikson.   Here.
Feld, Ferrison, Gentry.
Mr. Haas.
  Mr. Whitehouse.   Here.
Mr. Wicker. Mr. Wyden.
Mr. President, a quorum is not present.
The chair recognizes the minority leader, Mr. Erikson.
Mr. President,
I move to direct the sergeant at arms
to compel the attendance of absent Senators 
that warrants for the arrests of all senators not sick nor excused
be issued under the signature of the presiding officer.
The question is on the motion. All those in favor say "Aye"
Aye.
All those opposed, "Nay."
Nay.
The ayes have it, and the motion is agreed to.
The sergeant of arms is hereby instructed
to compel the attendance of absent senators.
It feels good to be back in Congress.
The Democrats have now empowered the Capitol Police
to arrest absent members if necessary.
According to Republican Senator Curtis Haas,
one of the staunchest opponents of the entitlement amendment,
the vice president is, quote,
"Replacing democracy with tyranny.
He's transformed the Senate into a police state within the Capitol."
But   
It'll be even harder to stay out of the news now.
Then why the joint interview?
I watched the South Carolina one again.
Convinced them to make me a copy.
It's powerful. Here you go.
I thought you might want it.
There's a moment where you ran your fingers through his hair.
It's intimate and human.
That moment alone would've made me want to vote for your husband.
Something like that will buy you months of flying beneath the radar.
And who do you have in mind to conduct the interview?
Does this mean I have the job?
It means you still haven't been ruled out.
Well, I'll consider that progress.
This is the Democratic cloak room, Hector.
Yours is on the other side.
What you're doing won't work.
It might. Which is why you made the long walk over here.
Ice water?
I have my people in planes, trains, and automobiles.
All I need is six to make my quorum.
Think what I can do with  votes.
And I've got .
You won't be able to get your planes and trains back here fast enough.
I'll roll those dice.
The sergeant at arms is very good at his job.
And this is a perfect way to show Curtis who's in charge.
I'm doing you a favor, Hector.
Tell me what you want.
What I've always wanted. The package we shook hands on.
Then I'll give you your Senate back.
They can't come back voluntarily.
Pick your six best actors.
We can't give in, Hector.
We wouldn't be in this situation had you towed the party line.
Mr. Mendoza is present.
Under protest.
Ms. Cornwall is present.
Under protest.
Mr. Ullman is present. Mr. Walsh is present.
Ms. Douster is present.
And Mr. Haas is present.
Mr. President, a quorum is now present.
You can pass the amendment. I'll just filibuster the main bill.
No, you won't.
Watch me.
As much as I'd like to see you hold your piss for two days,
we struck a deal with Hector.
The passage of the substitute amendment
constitutes passage of the main bill.
I wasn't informed of that.
Pay attention to the fine print, Curtis.
It's far more important than the selling price.
Let's go.
I want an immediate call of the roll.
Don't let half a second pass.
Yes, sir.
A quorum is present.
The question is on the adoption of the substitute
amendment to HR .
The yeas and nays have been ordered,
and the clerk will call the roll.
Mr. Abner?
Aye.
Mr. Avendale?
Aye.
Mr. Brown?
I'd like to propose an amendment to HR 
Mr. Haas, you are out of order. The roll call has begun.
The clerk will continue to call the roll.
Mr. Brown? Mr. Burr?
Aye.
Ms. Cantwell?
Aye.
Mr. Cerini?
Aye.
Mr. Chess?
Aye.
Ms. Cornwall?
Nay.
Mr. Colson?
I'm glad you came.
Yeah. Me, too.
What'd you think?
The music was really beautiful.
Not what you expected?
I wasn't sure what to expect.
I'm Lisa.
Rachel. Sorry.
No. We've got cookies and cake inside, if you...
I think I'm gonna...
If you want to meet some of my friends.
  Yeah. Okay.   Yeah?
  Yeah. Yeah.   Okay.
We should add "Miracle worker" to your resume, Frank.
Lazarus makes for a good magic act,,
but life would have been a lot easier
if the bastard hadn't died in the first place.
The president wanted to go ballistic, but I calmed him down.
I said, "Don't worry. Frank'll pull this out.
Did you? I don't blame you for being two-faced, Raymond.
It's good politics, as long as you don't get caught at it.
Now, Frank, if you think that I   
It's okay, Raymond. Jesus forgives you. Goodnight.
Hello?
Hello?
Care for some wine?
No.
Step in the room.
Closer. Closer.
State your name and the date.
Wait, why? I   
State your name and the date, please.
Lucas Goodwin. February th.
Year.
Are you currently or have you ever been a member of the   
What    what    what is this?
Are you currently or have you ever been a member
of any law enforcement agency?
I already told you I wasn't.
Two-step verification.
No, I'm not. And I haven't.
Are you currently or have you ever been
an informant for law enforcement?
No.
You think you might have been followed?
Anything strange the past few weeks?
Th   this is    you know what?
This is making me feel uncomfortable   
We're not fucking around here.
If you think the FBI hasn't been tracking your posts,
then you're naive.
You think they know who I am?
No. You hid yourself well.
What are you going to do with the Herald.
Nothing.
Then why did you want access?
I already had access.
It's how I contacted you in the first place.
Just needed to know if you were serious.
That's Cashew.
Why did you contact me?
Because you're desperate.
And I'm not fond of authority.
Just today, under the leadership of Vice President Underwood,
the Senate passed HR ,
along with an historic entitlement reform amendment.
By raising the retirement age to  and 
for normal and early retirement, respectively,
we will ensure entitlements for generations to come.
And when the House passes that bill in a few weeks,
as I fully expect it to do,
we will put the government freeze to rest.
We will continue the business of serving our country,
rather than paralyzing it.
The American people deserve no less.
We stand at the altar of democracy.
Let us stand together.
I spoke to Jackie. You have my support in the House.
But it hasn't passed the House yet.
There's a long march before it arrives on the president's desk.
As for me, I used to be on the edge of the frame.
Now I'm only three feet away.House.of.Cards.SE
Strange not seeing your name up there.
"To improve is to change."
"To perfect is to change often."
You know your Churchill.
It's inscribed on a watch you gave me when I left for Glendon Hill.
Was it? Nancy arranges all the gifts.
She knows you well.
As much as I am enjoying this little   
I got you two more votes. Partridge and Krauss.
Is this Raymond's way of extending an olive branch?
It's a start.
Two votes is a twig. It's not a branch.
Which is why I'm here.
Well, the vote's at :. We have less than three hours.
Two hours and forty-nine minutes.
We have made more happen in less.
Is that the watch?
No. It's nicer.
So, why did Raymond have a change of heart?
If the government grinds to a halt, that benefits no one.
We want the President focused on China,
not distracted by furloughs and protests.
You take direction from Jacqueline.
She's not gonna like that very much.
Bossing you around?
Having me around.
Oh, I don't blame her.
Ashleigh will start the interview with questions
about how you and your husband met, your early marriage.
Fine.
Then she'll move on to more specific questions
about your recent transition.
All right.
She's gonna ask about you having no children.
I thought we'd agreed to take that off the table.
We did. But they insisted.
Now I can speak to Ashleigh directly and fight for   
No. It's fine. I've been asked the question before.
I know how to answer it.
It'll be quick and painless.
And I'll confirm that with Ashleigh when she gets here.
I like it.
Maybe something less neutral.
I'm sure you'll look good in whatever you choose.
I'll be downstairs.
Disori owes you    for the overpass funding you secured.
  Yes, he does.   I'll call him.
Where's Doug?
He's doing the rounds, making sure our hard-won stay hard.
Birch and Womack are doing the same. But we're still  short.
Got relationships with most of these folks.
Money's not enough.
I already tried the D-trip route.
Retirement is the main sticking point, correct?
Old people vote.
I'll target the AARP. That'll take most of the heat off.
We're wasting our time. I gotta get to work.
Take Remy with you.
Shouldn't we divide and conquer?
It's harder to say "no" twice than once.
I'll stay out of your way.
Like you did on the Watershed Act?
We're on the same side of the fence this time.
You're late to the party.
Well, think of Remy as the guy who shows up
with a six-pack after the liquor store is closed.
Who's on your plate?
Donald Blythe.
Do you really think that's the best use of your time?
If I can get him to turn his people.
That's a lot of eggs to put in one basket.
We only have one basket.
Uh, Jacqueline, may I use your office, for old time's sake?
I serve at the pleasure of the Vice President.
Two hours and seventeen minutes.
Normally, all I need to sway Donald Blythe is patience and time,
neither of which I have right now.
Tick, tock.
Donald. Good to see you.
Mr. Vice President.
Please, it's always "Frank" to you.
I came because you asked me, but don't mistake that for false hope.
If you have other people to lobby, you should.
Ten minutes.
It won't change anything.
Well, at the very least, enjoy the free coffee.
I don't drink caffeine.
Then decaf.
Still has caffeine.
Well, enjoy the free oxygen.
It's gets stuffy over there in the Longworth Building.
Coffee for me, and, uh...
Seltzer water, if you have it.
I'm sure we do.
Now I can understand if you might hold a grudge.
I don't hold grudges, Frank.
I just don't negotiate with people who are fundamentally deceptive.
I never lied to you, Donald.
You promised to seek my counsel, which you never once did.
We had to move the education bill in a direction
I knew would make you unhappy.
  I saw no reason to frustrate   You eviscerated the unions.
You federalized performance standards.
If we hadn't done that, the bill would've been dead in the water.
And now you want to cut the pathetic level of funding you did manage to pass.
Isn't some funding better than none?
A flat-line will send a louder message than life support.
Look, I, I'm impressed with the little coalition
that you've cobbled together,
  But we   Not so little.
Twenty-eight votes. And you need them all.
Well, really only half.
Half of zero is still zero.
I had to pull every trick in the book
to get entitlement through the Senate.
If it fails in the House, we don't get a round two.
This is a one-time deal.
It never should've passed the Senate to begin with.
Can we start over? May I offer you an apology?
Deaf ears, Frank.
I withdrew myself from the education fight,
and that is my cross to bear.
But I will be damned if I will make the same mistake twice.
This sort of stubbornness makes you no better than the Tea Party.
Except for the fact that we happen to be right.
Just a few more minutes, Donald.
You haven't even had your seltzer yet.
They have seven other data centers spread across the Northeast.
Those aren't good odds.
Well, if we can access one,
I should be able to talk to the other seven.
And they all look like that, Fort Knox wrapped in a nuclear bunker.
How do we get in?
Well, we don't. You do.
How? Wh  what's my reason?
You're writing a story on cyber terrorism. It's free publicity.
But if they're so secure, I'm   
They give tours all the time, mostly to prospective clients.
Then why haven't you done it yourself?
Because I run a white-hat firm.
And if I were to show up in the tour logs before a breach,
it would raise alarms.
Okay, once I'm in?
These are what the servers look like.
You're gonna get inside one of these cages.
You will have this. You slide it into the server.
  Voila.   It's that simple?
Yeah. Well, your part. Not mine. The code's extremely complex.
How do I do it without them noticing?

Practice makes perfect.
We've got a problem.
Everyone, stop what you're doing, head into the nearest office,
and shut the door.
You, stay exactly where you are.
Retirement age is a done deal,
but I might be able to redistribute some appropriations to oth  
That's not what I'm after.
You can't fix a wrecked car with new hubcaps.
How about a sister bill, one that focuses entirely on education.
My coalition is fighting for the integrity of the party.
  Tha  We're not just focused on Education.   I'm sorry, Donald.
Excuse me for a moment.
Nancy, I said, 'No interrup' 
When?
But the vote is in less than an hour. I
I don't care what protocol it  !
Quarantine. There's white powder in the mail.
We're locked in?
Sir! Close the door now!
Look, I have to   
Now, sir! Please!
I should call my wife.
And I should call Claire.
Should I tell Connor?
No. It's better the press doesn't know.
The field tests should come in before the vote.
And as soon as the tally's in, I'll come home.
How's it looking?
Shaky. We may lose this one.
That could make for a tough interview.
Well, I didn't want to do it in the first place.
Well, we're committed now.
I better get back to the Holy Crusader.
Let me know as soon as the tests have cleared.
If we're lucky, it'll be anthrax,
and I won't live long enough to see the bill fail.
Don't say that.
We're gonna be fine.
How many of these quarantines we been through?
I've lost count.
Wish me luck with Donald.
Heels crossed.
  It's ripping the caucus apart.   Of course.
We take a united stand on our version of the bill.
Some of us have to stay on our feet.
This is about party unity...
It's about abandoning our base.
No, that's what the Freeze is.
Our base doesn't benefit from sword-rattling.
It gets left bleeding on the field.
My district has the third largest number of seniors in the country.
If we raise the age of retirement, the AARP will raise hell.
I spoke with the President of the AARP this morning.
He'll be receiving a   million endowment next week.
Voters will still revolt.
The midterms are gonna be ugly.
Many of us  And I can certainly speak for myself  are fac   
The choice is between immediate discontinuation of services
and an age bump five years from now.
You're comparing theoretical discomfort to imminent pain.
I just feel like we're losing touch with our core values.
The Education Bill is a good example.
We all followed Frank's lead,
hoping it would buy us traction with the Republicans.
Would you excuse me, just one moment?
  Does the press know?   Not yet.
Can you keep in touch with him?
I need to pommel our lunch guests into submission.
You've got 'em close. But relax. Listen more.
They want their hands held, not someone in their face.
I know how to whip votes.
Best caviar in D.C., Ladies and Gentlemen.
We can't let you pay for that.
Then don't eat it. But if you do, I won't tell anyone.
You were saying about the Education Bill?
No, Marjory, honey.
Remember, we just talked about it.
I was telling you 
Right. Nothing to worry about.
If you have any questions, ask Molly.
She knows what's going on.
I will call as soon as I know anything.
I love you.
How's Marjory?
She's okay.
Long call.
You know, she gets emotional.
Molly took a semester off to be at home.
I told her she needs to head back in the spring.
I don't want her mother dragging her down.
Must be hard on you.
Harder on the girls, I think.
  Is she lucid?   About half the time.
Just enough to be aware of how quickly she's going.
Awful.
I feel terrible saying it,
but part of me is looking forward to her not being lucid.
At least then she won't realize what's happening.
I should have thought of this before.
Appeal to the heart, not the brain.
Forgive my ignorance, but
has there been any progress with research?
Some. Genetic testing, vascular manipulation, but it's slow.
They won't come up with anything in time for Marjory.
We're focusing on quality of life.
Look, I    I know you have work to do, so...
Oh, I'm no longer the Whip anymore. That's Jacqueline's job.
I just agreed to meet with you because we have a history.
She would be tougher to say not to.
  But still it would've been a "no".   Yes.
I admire your convictions, Donald.
You're a rare breed nowadays.
It didn't sound that way when you were comparing us to the Tea Party.
I was being unfair.
You're not a reactionary. You're a progressive.
I see where this is going.
How do you mean?
When you've been in the wasteland as long as I have,
you become immune to flattery.
I know you think I'm fundamentally deceptive,
but I am capable of a genuine compliment.
Then I will take it as one, but it won't soften my resolve.
If it did, you wouldn't deserve the compliment in the first place.
If you vote ':no,' I won't hold it against you.
We're all in this together through the midterms.
But if you stick with me,
we can show both the Republicans and the American people
that we are capable of more than stagnation.
And that's worth something, even it if hurts.
Who can I count on?
Copy that.
The fact that there is still a door between us, I take as a bad sign.
One tested negative, one inconclusive, sir.
That means we have to take the samples to the lab.
So, how much longer?
Another three or four hours.
We have an important vote going to the floor.
I have to be talking to my people.
The vote is delayed, sir.
We're evacuating this side of the Capital.
So no vote?
Not until we get the all-clear.
Good things happen to good people.
Another thing, sir.
All cell phone service, Wi-Fi, land lines   
We'll be blocking them, in case there's a legitimate security threat.
I need to be able to call my wife.
I apologize, sir. We can have someone notify her.
No. It needs to be me.
She gets very anxious if she doesn't recognize the voice.
Congressman, I have strict instructions not to allo 
Figure it out. Unless you want me to get the White House involved.
I'll find a way, sir.
There are advantages to being Vice President.
Ma'am? We'll have to ask you to remain up here for a little while.
Is it the quarantine?
The Capitol is being evacuated.
We expect everything to be fine.
It's just standard procedure.
Uh, you won't be able to get through. Communication is being jammed.
You mean I can't even speak to Francis?
Not until the all-clear.
How long?
Four hours is the estimate right now.
We're supposed to tape it in  minutes.
Nothing we can do.
You okay?
Yes.
I'll go talk to Emma.
You know, I'm fine. Thank you.
Em.
So we might have a problem.
It's all over the news.
It could be a while.
Can we get audio from the Vice President?
Communications are being jammed until the evacuation is over.
Have you spoken to Ashleigh?
She thinks we should get a sat truck down here. Wait and go live.
I can't guarantee when that will be.
The Vice President is quarantined in the Capitol, and we have an exclusive.
The network will broadcast whenever the hell we tell them to.
They're holding off until you get here.
You should do the interview solo.
I'd rather wait.
Who knows whether we'll win the vote?
If we lose, I don't want my face on national television.
This could be a silver lining.
I don't know, Francis.
I'm sure you'll be terrific.
Let me run it past Connor.
Okay. Thank you. We're done.
Sir, we were able to get Mrs. Blythe.
Oh, Donald...
Marjory?
  Hello?   Yes, it's me, sweetheart.
It's hard to hear you.
We're still stuck inside the office.
What office?
At the Capitol. It   it's going to be a l-a little while longer.
But why are you there? It's Sunday.
No, it    it's Friday, sweetheart.
  Donald?   I'm here.
Uh, who is this man with me?
Uh, he's a police officer.
They're using walkie-talkies so we can speak.
Who am I talking to?
It's your husband, ma'am.
I'm not married.
It    It's me. It's Donald.
Turn it off. I don't know that man.
Marjory...
She went into the other room, sir.
Okay.
Thank you.
If you could stay with her, please...
Yes, sir.
Drink?
Sure. Why not?
For all we know it could be midnight before he's out.
And then he still needs to manage the vote.
We're fine if it's two a.m.
When everyone's asleep?
People would stay up for this.
The whole point was prime time.
Then we do it tomorrow.
We've already set aside half a day for this.
The Vice President can't rearrange his entire schedule for an interview.
I don't see any other options.
I spoke to Francis over the radio.
We think I should do it alone.
Just you?
Mrs. Underwood and Ashleigh, one-on-one.
Maybe we can broadcast his voice
Francis doesn't want the entire interview to be about the quarantine.
Neither do I. That's just spectacle.
The quarantine is news. We have a unique opportunity   
Fine. We're done.
  What?   Cancel the interview. No reschedule.
Come on, Connor.
Please pack up everything and leave.
Okay, wait. Let me call Ashleigh.
I thought I'd get used to it,
but no. Hurts every time.
You spend  years with someone,
and then they don't have a damn clue who you are.
Ugh... I really shouldn't...
If we never did anything we shouldn't do,
we'd never feel good about doing the things we should.
Excellent point.
And if these are our last moments on earth
I don't know about you, but I'd rather go out with a buzz on.
To Marjory.
You love her dearly.
More than anything.
I can't imagine what I'd do without Claire,
or if she didn't remember who I was.
Hopefully, you'll never have to.
Well, it makes me angry that you do, that anybody does.
No sense being angry over what you can't change.
How much funding does Alzheimer's research get?
Just under   million.
Well, I'm no expert, but that sounds inadequate to me.
It is. For every   we allocate to research,
we spend nearly  , on care.
We oughta change that.
I tried. My bill didn't even leave committee.
Who opposed it?
Howard Webb.
Ugh. Appropriations.
He didn't even put it to a vote.
I've never been fond of Howard.
That makes two of us.
What was his argument?
He didn't feel he owed me one.
'Fiscally irresponsible,' is all he said.
Walk me through the specifics of your bill.
I see what you're doing.
Doing what?
You're disgusting, Frank.
Excuse me?
Using my wife.
Donald, what are saying?
You think I'll give in on Entitlement
if you slap some extra Alzheimer's funding on the table?
I was not suggesting that at all.
Bullshit, Frank.
You think as little of me as you want,
but I do not barter with people's health.
Then why are you trying to raise the age of Retirement?
Medical research we can afford.
Medicare, we can't. There are realities, Donald.
Don't talk down to me about reality. My wife is dying.
That's a reality. Other people will die, too,
if your package succeeds. That's a reality.
God damn it.
I wish I wasn't stuck in this fucking room with you.
Donald?
I'm done talking.
  One more time.   I've got it.
I want it to sound more natural.
Uh, Francis and I both wanted to devote our lives to public service.
And we didn't feel that we could both do that
and be the parents we wanted to be.
And by making that choice it allows more time for us
to be in the service of others.
Good. That sounds good.
We need you, Mrs. Underwood.
Keep Derek at the Capitol.
I want quotes from evacuees and Homeland Security.
And Sarah should be finishing that history of biohazard scares.
I'll be there soon.
I have to go.
No. We're not done yet.
This is a major story. I'll come back tomorrow.
Gonna be two days in a row, and this is how patterns emerge.
The FBI likes patterns, and we do not give the FBI what the FBI likes.
I can't disappear all day in the middle of 
I have eight reporters out in the field,okay?
Stop.
Tell me why I purchased Cashew.
I don't know.
Companionship?
Yes.
More importantly, a reminder that I am never
more than one wrong move away from life in a cage.
You stay.
I'll walk you through every line of code I intend to write,
every attempt I make to breach the wall.
If we get caught, you don't get to plead ignorance.
We go down together.
No, I didn't sign up for Bonnie and Clyde.
You need me for this one thing.
Just like I need you. But whatever you've done before me, that   
You know where I live. And you know who I am.
Sit down. The sooner we start, the sooner we finish.
The Capitol is still on lockdown,
as HAZMAT crews continue a thorough sweep of the building.
Earlier this morning, a white powder-like substance...
...was found in a package mailed to the office
of Majority Whip Jacqueline Sharp.
Not are we free to go?
Almost, sir. Less than hour.
I've got a message from your wife.
What is it?
She's doing the interview live right now.
...Quarantined with Congressman Donald Blythe
and  of Miss Sharp's staff. The secrets
Mrs. Underwood, I so appreciate you
taking the time to speak with us today in what,
I am certain, is a very stressful situation.
Thank you, Ashleigh.
Have you spoken with your husband today?
Yes, I did. And he's in very good spirits,
and in good hands with the Secret Service.
Of course, he's very disappointed he couldn't be here.
Well, our thoughts are with him and   
and everyone quarantined at the Capitol.
Thank you.
I'd like to begin with Claire Underwood
before she met her husband, in Texas.
And I have a couple of pictures.
  Oh, no.   Yes.
Oh. My goodness. That was Red.
An accomplished rider?
Uh, an enthusiast.
This one's from a couple of years later.
Oh, my goodness.
You like those penny loafers?
Those are wonder 
Those are two very different girls.
Which one are you more comfortable being?
My family's ranch. That was home...for me.
You didn't like the prep school?
No. I think I preferred the dirt.
You grew up in  in Dallas, though. Um, Highland Park.
Yes. My father, um, well, he was a businessman,
So we lived in the city, but we're ranchers.
I mean, we  we go back three generations, our family.
Your parents were very wealthy.
Uh, we were comfortable, yes.
They made sure I wanted for nothing.
It was a very happy childhood.
What is your most vivid memory from that time?
My 'most vivid memory.'
Probably when I was about nine or ten,
my father took me to Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy was shot.
And he said, 'Claire, a great man died here.'
And I remember not fully comprehending the meaning of death yet.
And I asked him how he died, and he told me.
And I remember feeling so sad, so angry.
It seemed so unfair.
I started to cry, and my daddy picked me up.
And he wrapped his arms around me,
and he said, 'Don't be sad, sweetheart.
"He made the world a better place,
but sometimes that comes at a price.'
I guess that was the most vivid memory.
We are only eight votes away.
I'm sorry. I've made up my mind.
Me, too. I've gotta stick to my guns on this one.
You would rather let the government shut down   
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't put that on us
just because we're on the ass-end of the whip list.
Don't get us wrong. We have a lot of respect for you Jackie.
You're doing a fine job since Frank's gone.
Different styles, but a fine job.
Excuse us just a moment.
They're not taking me seriously.
'Cause you're not Frank.
You mean because I'm not a man.
No. I mean Frank. They're used to being offered something.
Ask them what they want.
I know Paul needs help with a waste treatment facility.
You're being just as condescending as they are.
Take some good advice when you get it.
I was right earlier, wasn't I?
Paul, Remy tells me you need a waste treatment plant.
We've had some trouble getting matching federal funds.
Ben, you mentioned once a winery museum in your district?
We are making some great wines in Long Island these days.
I've tried some.
It tastes like piss, compared to what we have in Napa,
the sort of piss that belongs in Paul's waste treatment plant.
Jackie  
We have a possible terror attack,
and you're holding out your plate for more pork.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
In my caucus, people are rewarded for good behavior,
not trading their votes for ransom.
When we walk in there, I expect the both of you to vote 'yes,'
without a moment's hesitation.
Thank you for your change of heart.
Six more to go.
You left Texas and, um, spent the last two years of high school
at the prestigious Phillips Academy.
  Um, and then, onto Radcliffe.   Yes.,
Where you would meet the future Vice President.
Back then just a dashing law student.
I never dreamed he would become Vice President, of course.
Some people might think that your marriage may be a bit more
calculated than you let on,
that perhaps he needed your family's money.
No. That's just not true.
Your father did contribute an awful lot to his campaign.
Yes, he did. Because he believed in Francis.
Would he have won that campaign
had it not been for your father's contributions?
I don't know. I mean, it certainly helped.
But I like to think that it was Francis' ideas and leadership
that convinced voters, not just TV commercials.
You've been married for  years.
That's right.
You were just in school. I mean, you married so young.
We did. But when you've found 'the one'...
well, Francis was the one.
You call him "Francis."
Well, back home, they call him "Frank," still.
But he likes that I call him "Francis."
He said it makes him sound more sophisticated.
Is it hard being a politician's wife?
It's thrilling. Not without its challenges.
Always in the background, subsuming your goals for his goals.
No, I don't see it that way.
We're two very independent people who
have chosen to live our lives together.
I support him. He supports me.
Which, you know, goes back to the political partnership.
Well, my husband happens to be a politician,
and I happen to do political work.
But our partnership extends far beyond that.
Children.
Was that a sacrifice?
Because you haven't had any.
Francis and I wanted to devote our lives to public service.
And we didn't feel that we could both do that
and be the parents we wanted to be.
So, we made the choice.
We've heard that answer before.
Sorry?
You have given the exact same answer in previous interviews.
Because it's the truth.
Forgive me, but 'career' and 'timing,'
uh, those are often very convenient answers.
It is true that whatever it takes for people to get
from 'maybe' to 'yes' never arrived for me.
Never felt the pressure? No maternal instinct?
No.
And it was a choice? It wasn't because you couldn't have any?
Well, Francis and I did what was right for us.
Because it is unusual, I mean, even now,
for politicians at the executive level
not to have children.
Yes, it is.
In your husband's second congressional campaign,
there was a Republican, a pro-family candidate,
who made some pretty unsettling accusations.
Well, Francis is a Southern Democrat,
and we have thick skins.
He suggested, in order to keep your husband's political career on track.
Children are the center of many people's lives.
And I think they just want to make sure that
their representatives will fight for their children's dreams.
And Francis has, again and again, proven that he will.
And he will continue to do as Vice President.
He claimed that you may have been pregnant during the campaign.
Was there a pregnancy?
Have you ever been pregnant?
  Break. Now.   That's not gonna happen.
Yes.
During the campaign?
Before.
Was it a miscarriage?
No.
Did you  did you terminate the pregnancy?
If I said 'yes,'
my husband's political career would be in jeopardy.
My faith would be questioned.
Likely, my life would be threatened.
But I won't be ashamed. Yes, I was pregnant.
And, yes, I had an abortion.
Can you excuse me for one moment?
Of course. We'll have more of our live interview
with Claire Underwood when we return.
That took a lot of guts.
Yes, it did.
No. It'll look like I am ashamed.
I'm not. And I won't.
Nothing you can say will make this any better.
I'd rather deal with the dama  
I'm not going to run from this.
She's gonna ask why you had the abortion.
I haven't had one. I've had three.
Three? No. You need to stick to one.
Okay, fine.
Tell me what you'll say.
Well, I can't use the real reason.
The first two, I was a teenager, and I was reckless.
What about the third?
Well, the article that she showed, it's right.
I was on the pill.
It didn't work.
We talked about having a baby, and then we decided against it.
Why?
Because we were focused on the campaign.
How many weeks in?
Sixteen.
You can't say any of this.
Go upstairs. I'll deal with Ashleigh.
If we're going to continue, we've got about  seconds.
Connor, I   
Please, trust me. You'll be making a big mistake.
Are you willing to discuss the circumstances   ?
I became pregnant as a result of a sexual assault.
Are you saying that you  you were   ?
Raped.
You've never spoken about this publicly about this before.
No one ever asked.
Can you tell us what happened?
Uh, it was college. A classmate, we were dating.
And it happened on a  We had a fight,
and he forced himself on me.
Did you tell anybody about it, and did he   ? Was he charged?
No. Because at the time I felt that I was somehow at fault.
I knew I wasn't,
but... just didn't want to be stared at.
I didn't want to be known as 'the girl who got raped.'
And when I became pregnant, I wasn't going to drop out of school.
I wasn't going to let this man ruin my life.
So I made a choice. I ended it.
But if you never told anybody about it,
the assailant could still be out there.
Can you tell us anything about him?
I saw him, uh,
for the first time in almost  years just a few months ago.
Where?
At a commissioning ceremony that Francis and I attended.
You speak to him?
Briefly. Francis pinned stars on him.
He was being commissioned?
General Dalton McGinnis.
And for the record, Francis has always known about the assault.
He just didn't know the name.
And he's been nothing but supportive all these years.
W   w  we're gonna have to reach out to the General.
for a response to what you just said.
Would you mind if we took a quick break?
Absolutely.
We'll be right back with Mrs. Claire Underwood.
Take all the time you need.
The lab tests all came back negative, sir.
What was it?
Talcum powder laced with flour.
It was pesticide from the wheat that gave us the false positive.
  So are we're free to go?   Yes, sir.
  Nancy, let them 'em I'm on my way down.   I already did.
  Mind if I use your phone?   Of course.
And, Donald? I'm gonna get you that research funding,
no matter how the vote goes.
  It's your call, because I'm still voting against it.   I understand.
You have a brave wife, Frank.
So do you, Donald.
Frank!
How'd you do?
  We're down to four. How about Blythe?   He won't budge.
What did you offer him?
Alzheimer's research. He was insulted.
The vote's in  minutes.
I need to get to Claire. Who should I call from the car?
We've exhausted our options.
It's either Blythe's people, or it won't pass.
They're too loyal to him.
Okay. Go. I'll figure it out.
I can stay if you need me.
No. Get to your wife. I know where to find you.
Nancy, I need every ream of paper you have. And get me dollies.
Almost done. Twenty more minutes.
I hate lying.
  Did he do it?   Yes.
Then, don't feel bad.
What if he denies it?
Then we'll cross that bridge.
  Connor?   Give us one more minute.
We have a young woman on the phone, a private.
She says she was also assaulted by the General. Two years ago.
She wants to share her story, but she won't give her name.
We can't put her on if she's anonymous.
  You want me to convince her?   She's frightened.
Is she still on the phone?
I've never told anyone.
It took me almost half my life before I could say anything.
But you can say something now.
I don't know.
Just think of how many others there must have been.
But you want me to talk.
Well, would you have called if you didn't want to?
I didn't think I'd have to use my name.
Listen, I understand you're afraid of the consequence.
I'm a private. He's a general.
And my husband is the Vice President of the United States.
We will protect you. I promise you that.
What's your name?
Private Megan Hennessey.
What is this?
The names of every person in America
who will lose home care when the Freeze sets in,
who will lose half of their welfare benefits,
who will go on furlough, who will lose their student loans,
transportation services, post-combat counseling. Shall I go on?
This is about the big picture, Jacqueline.
This picture looks pretty big to me.
I can't vote for the package.
Then don't. Just get four of your people to do it.
And then work with me after we avoid the Freeze.
I'm not Frank Underwood.
At least two other girls that same year.
If that was true for all the years he's served...
It's just staggering.
And I felt so helpless.
And he keeps rising in the ranks. The system protects him.
Why do you think no one has ever reported him?
Do you wanna join her?
  We know it won't do anything.   No.
Chain of command.
It's inexcusable that you're willing to put your life on the line
to defend our freedom, and yet you don't feel
the freedom to come forward.
I love my country.
And I love serving in the Marines.
But not like this.
Private Hennessey, thank you for your courage in joining us this tonight.
It was Mrs. Underwood who gave me the courage.
And, Mrs. Underwood, thank you, for your honesty.
Sir, your wife is on the phone.
You've given all of us a great deal to think about.
Thank you, Ashleigh.
And that concludes our live,
one-on-one exclusive interview with Claire Underwood.
You can watch the entire interview on our website.
And, as always, we invite you to give us your thoughts
and your comments on Facebook and on Twitter.
But, for now, thanks for watching. And good night.
And we're out.
This is going to make waves like you never imagined.
Thank you.
Where's Carter?
You'll be reporting to me now.
And who are you?
Carter's boss.
You're doing good work, Gavin.
But you can't be assaulting the target. That could compromise us.
I don't even know why you're going after this guy.
He's small-time.
That's not your concern.
He couldn't write a line of code to save his life.
He intends to commit an act of cyber terrorism.
Well, that's intention, not capability. He's not a real threat.
Maybe Carter talked things out with you.
I won't.
How much longer?
Until what?
Until I can stop.
Do you prefer prison?
I've given you eight child pornographers,
three botnet masters...
But you still haven't given us the AVunit.
Well, I told Carter I don't know where he is.
Yes, you do.
I don't. Nobody does.
Then what about your friends in Dec-Sec?
I'm not giving you my friends.
Then you'll keep doing this. You're a productive asset, Gavin,
but the moment you stop being productive, no lawyer can help you.
Wish we had the real thing right now.
Always prepared.
Francis.
I've missed this.
So have I.
Shouldn't you be on the phone getting your accolades?
That can wait till tomorrow.
Sing me something.
What do you want to hear?
Anything.
 Polly, pretty Polly 
 Would you take me unkind? 
 Oh, Polly, pretty Polly 
 Would you take me unkind? 
 Let me set beside you 
 And tell you my mind 
 Well, my mind is to marry 
 And never to part 
 Well, my mind is to marry 
 And never to part 
 The first time I saw you 
 You wounded my heart 
 Oh, Polly, pretty Polly 
 Come go along with me 
 Oh, Polly, pretty Polly 
 Come go along with me 
 Before we get married 
 Some pleasures to see 
 Before we get married 
 Some pleasures to see House.of.Cards.SE
Here began the last bloody march toward Appomattox
where General Grant met General Lee for the first time.
And brave men bled, set the course of history.
I'm so honored to be here,
celebrating the th anniversary of the Overland Campaign.
Thank you to County Administrator Roberts,
to all the dedicated re-enactors,
and, of course,
to Governor O'Keefe for organizing such a wonderful three-day event.
Oh. That's all, sir?
That's it. Short and sweet.
Or at least it's short.
In Gaffney, people called it the "War of Northern Aggression."
I personally take no pride in the Confederacy.
Avoid wars you can't win,
and never raise your flag for a asinine cause like slavery.
  He's on his way.   Fine.
People will move on.
They won't. The less you say, the more they'll dig.
Let them.
Willa, could you give us two seconds?
I'll be right outside.
McGinnis happened in college.
The abortion happened five years later.
There aren't any medical records.
None at all?
We specifically made sure.
A nurse? Somebody in the waiting room?
The doctor was the only one there.
Then where is he now?
It's a long time ago, Connor. He passed away.
And if I'm not worried, you shouldn't be.
Even still, sexual assault is part of the conversation now.
Every article and column mentions you.
If we offer nothing, we can't shape your image.
I made it very clear I don't want exposure.
When we have something new to say, we'll say it.
Willa. Any luck with the Joint Chiefs?
The Chairman's Office still says he's unavailable.
But they did offer to send the Director of the Joint Staff,
Confirm it.
We'll meet in Francis' office at the West Wing.
Anything else?
No. I should get going, hit the road.
Thank you, Connor.
Get Congresswoman Brooks on the phone.
And see if the First Lady will be available this afternoon.
You want a brief on everyone on the Chinese side of the Summit?
No. What Durant's doing in Washington is just the facade.
This is the real negotiation.
Give me what you have on Feng.
Xander Feng. Deep family connections to the Party.
Grandfather fought side by side with Mao.
Big in the telecom industry.
Estimated net worth is over  billion.
More than Raymond's.
By a few billion. But who's counting?
Do they have any other business partnerships
other than the Rare Earth Refinery?
Not that I could find.
All right. Get a progress update from Durant.
Tell her I'll be in touch as soon as we know what Feng wants.
When a man like Raymond Tusk gets involved in state diplomacy,
you can be sure he's not after the Nobel Peace Prize.
He's an opportunist. But so am I.
Maybe this is my opportunity to loosen his grip on the President.
Mr. Vice President, when are you returning to Washington?
  Mr. Vice President, are you...   Mr. Vice President,
do you have any idea how long you'll be in Spotsylvania?
Any comments on the talks with the Chinese?
Can we get a comment on the upcoming Summit talks?
Vice President will be working
from his room for the remainder of the day.
We'll let you know.
Sir, when are you returning to Washington?
Mr. Feng. It's a pleasure.
Likewise, Mr. Vice President.
Coffee? Tea?
I've already been offered, but thank you.
Thank you, Meechum.
It's a long flight from Beijing.
You must be exhausted.
I keep Western hours.
My midnight is your midnight.
So, have you had a chance to look over the proposal?
I have.
Shall we?
Page four.
The refinery.
With Mr. Tusk.
With the highest bidder.
We're prepared to offer Clayton West
a  year lease on the Mei Mei Rare Earth Elements Refinery.
To which I will lend my name.
I understand that you and Raymond are business associates,
but you're gonna have to open it up to bidding.
Mr. Tusk will outbid any competitors.
Well, even so, you know, for appearances.
Yes. Appearances. If you must.
So, there are no issues here, then?
We may proceed.
Page six.
The bridge.
The Committee on Foreign Investment will approve
a pilot infrastructure project
to build a bridge over the Long Island Sound,
from Port Jefferson to Milford,
in exchange for a  year toll-taking contract.
Before we consider the bridge,
there's one more item I'd like to discuss.
"Consider"? I thought the bridge was definite.
Nothing is definite.
This bridge is a priority-one item.
It's very important to your President. I understand.
What would you like to discuss?
The currency manipulation suit which
you have filed against us in the World Trade Organization.
Which we are prepared to drop
if all other conditions are met.
The point of this meeting is to allow us
to say things that cannot be said in formal settings, yes?
Yes. Of course.
We don't want you to drop the lawsuit.
Forgive me. I...
I don't understand.
Do not back off in the WTO.
But you've been fighting us
on currency manipulation for years.
A free-floating currency is inevitable.
Now I have something I can work with.
Why the sudden change of heart?
Not sudden, it has taken those of us who are more forward-thinking
many years to convince our counterparts.
But China could just do it.
I mean, you know as well as I, you don't require a WTO ruling.
Appearances, as you say.
It's important that it looks like America forced us out,
not that we gave in.
Well, I'll need a little more time,
so that I can brief the President.
I'm here for as long as necessary.
However you would like to communicate,
I leave that to you.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

Shake with your right hand, but hold a rock in your left.
Well, look who got stuck with the pool.
We volunteered because we hate ourselves.
All's well on the Southern front?
No news is no news.
Come on. I hear there's muskets out there.
When you giving us something real?
We're here in beautiful Spotsylvania, aren't we?
This is dress-up for grown men with toy guns.
Sounds like  words to me.
Tell Durant that China won't discuss the bridge
unless we drop the WTO suit.
I thought you said they want to keep it.
Feng does, which means Tusk does.
But we don't know if Beijing does.
You think Feng's lying?
An open currency could free up interest rates,
reduce inflation in China.
They'd both profit.
If they're forcing Beijing's hand, or we are,
that could throw the Summit into chaos.
Exactly. Look, Feng may well have support,
but my guess is that the Standing Committee's divided.
Either way, we'll throw 'em off balance.
Let's leak we're dropping the suit as soon as Cathy presents it.
Just the lawsuit? Nothing else in the leak?
A hint of Feng, but no names.
Let's let this grow on its own.
How was that?
Much better.
I feel good. What do you think?
I think you're ready.
How long on the code?
Just a couple of bugs to work out.
I told them tomorrow or Wednesday.
Work's not done.
If I postpone again, don't you think it'll draw attention? I   
It'll be done when it's done.
I'll email you when the bugs are fixed.
Somewhere public, a place and time.
Hey, are you sure you wanna do this?
I understand the risks.
Well, you think you do.
This isn't the first time I've been in danger.
Oh, yeah? Paper cuts at The Herald?
Death threats. When I exposed a drug ring in D.C.
You know, I read the articles.
That's small time.
I almost had to go into protection.
This is the FBI. It's not a few street cops.
You think you're badass because
you're on some vigilante anarchy kick?
At least I have the balls to put my name on the work I do.
You've never faced a hundred years in prison,
you self-righteous prick.
Most of my friends are locked up and rotting away
'cause they poked the bear one too many times.
Why? They wanted to expose government surveillance,
the PRISM program, embezzlement, abuse, fucking torture, lies.
You're a journalist. Who gives a shit? We're fucking soldiers.
It's personal for me now.
I don't have a choice, but you still do.
I don't have a choice.
Where did you get this?
You could say a source close to the Chinese delegation.
Give me a name.
All I know is that it's a Chinese businessman
with ties to the Standing Committee back-channeling the Summit.
  In Washington?   I don't know.
  With who?   I don't know that either.
If I call the USTR's office, they'll confirm?
I'm telling you as much as I know.
Why are you telling me this at all?
They're going public with it tomorrow anyway.
You might as well get the scoop.
Why me, specifically?
You deserve better than a Civil War reenactment.
Please don't pretend you've suddenly become Santa Claus.
I give you something now, maybe you'll remember.
It's an investment in the future.
I'm not big on favors.
I just said "maybe."
Connect me to the USTR's office.
Skip the Press Secretary.
Tell them I want to talk about the WTO suit.
Who did you speak to?
Connor. He's talking to Ayla Sayyad.
How much did you fill him in?
The bare minimum.
I'd be a lot more comfortable
if it was you going directly, as we discussed.
This puts distance on me, which puts distance on you.
I want you to meet with Feng tonight.
  No proxies.   Understood.
Now where are we with Mr. Goodwin?
Any day now. Thirty-five to life.
Cyber terrorism. Penalties are stiff.
This needs to be clean, Doug.
It will be.
One fall of the axe.
Keep me informed.
Yes, sir.
Well, I just think what you did took so much bravery.
To go on air like that, in front of the whole country,
and say what you did?
That means a lot to me.
And I admire what you both have been doing to advocate for the 
well, for the victims.
Well, women, like you and me. Not victims.
Men, too. It's not gender-specific.
Well, yes.
Would you consider pitching in?
How?
It would send a strong message if we had the First Lady in our corner.
If you think I could help.
Well, if the head of the Women's Caucus,
both wives from the White House...
That's a meeting they couldn't sweep under the rug.
And the fact that the Chairman sent anyone is promising,
but we need to make sure our message gets back to him.
I just...I haven't been through the same sort of experience.
Well, why should that prevent you?
I don't know if I have a right to speak about it.
You're the First Lady.
You have a right to speak about anything you want.
  Mr. White?   Mrs. Marbury.
I'm Susan.
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
I know I'm a little off the beaten path.
Did you have any trouble finding me?
No. The directions were great. Easy as pie.
Well, good.
Come in.
I have to admit I've been looking forward to this all day.
I didn't realize you were announcing so soon.
We've had some great luck with the endowment.
Well, my husband didn't get much recognition while he was alive.
I was so thrilled when Planned Parenthood asked to
name a fund after him.
Well, we're thrilled that you're open to it.
When you called, you said you had some questions?
They're delicate. That's why I wanted to come in person.
"Delicate", how?
There are a lot of people who will protest
this sort of financial assistance to minors.
And we want to make sure they have no cause to smear us.
People tried to smear my husband his entire career.
He never let it affect the work he was doing.
Did your husband ever perform any illegal abortions?
I need you to answer me, Mrs. Marbury.
Did your husband perform any illegal abortions?
I won't discuss that.
Nothing unreported?
Young man, you're not old enough to remember.
But there was a time when everybody   
What about any prominent figures
who the Anti-Choice crowd could vilify?
No.
Did Dr. Marbury perform an abortion for Claire Underwood?
No, he did not.
I know for a fact that he did.
That is not true, and I would like you to leave now.
Forgive me, Mrs. Marbury.
I haven't been entirely honest with you.
My name's Seth Grayson.
I don't work for Planned Parenthood.
No. Let him come to me.
Get Mr. Tusk on the phone.
You should ashamed of yourself.
I'm doing this for your own good, Mrs. Marbury.
Imagine the media frenzy.
Your husband's legacy, destroyed.
The press hounding you, day and night.
And Planned Parenthood Fund, gone.
How do I know you work for her?
That you're not just some right-wing fanatic who wants to destro?
Because I wouldn't have done you the courtesy of paying a visit.
There would've been an army of
satellite trucks at your door instead of me.
Well, I won't tell anyone, if that's what you're worried about.
I believe you.
Did your husband keep records of any kind of who he assisted?
Anything at all? Notes? Unofficial records?
He kept a journal.
Do you still have it?
May I?
Go ahead.
Oh. I need to take this with me.
Can't you just take out that page?
Someone finds this with pages missing,
that could raise eyebrows.
There's  years of his life in there.
From when we met until he died.
And do you want six decades
reduced to one night in August... years ago?
Now just imagine what it looked like back then.
The edge of the ridge was a dense thicket,
which allowed the Northern troops to come in and form on the Mule Shoe.
Now the Southern regiments were entrenched
in this area at the apex of the line.
As you can see,
the topography really forced the two sides down towards each other.
This is the Bloody Angle.
That's right.
I was reading about it last night.
Close quarters, hand-to-hand combat.
All told, about , Union-Confederate soldiers
lost their lives here at the Bloody Angle, on a battlefield
that's only about half a mile wide.
Now, Mr. Vice President, we have a surprise for you today.
I'd like to introduce you to Corporal Augustus Elijah Underwood
of the th Regiment of the McGowan Brigade,
your great-great-great-grandfather.
I died here in this battle.
I think there's been a mistake.
My grandfather never mentioned any Underwoods in the war.
We did our research.
He definitely fought and died here.
I was . And my son,
your great-great-grandfather was two years old.
I never met him.
It happened here, at the Bloody Angle?
At the edge of those woods.
My skull was bashed in with a rock.
Augustus, thank you.
Now, uh, over here we've got something that's,
uh, very interesting as well.
Uh, j-just a moment.
Tell me more.
It was the middle of the night.
And we were out of musket balls, just bayonets.
Only half of us had those. I had nothing.
Just these hands.
So dark, couldn't see nothing.
But you could hear 'em, the Yanks, runnin' toward us.
And then you could smell 'em.
First Yank that brushed up against me,
I grab him by the throat, fall down on the ground.
I bit him so hard, I could taste the bone.
Then he grabs a rock and brings it down right here.
And that was that.
I was buried in a mass grave, no headstone.
Could we get a picture with you and Augustus?
Yes.
Thank you.
He takes it rather seriously.
Oh, yeah. They all do.
Now, up ahead, we have examples of,
uh, Confederate ramparts that we've reconstructed.
And you can see how they cut the timber and made the trenches.
Now these trenches traded hands
many times over the course of the battle.
You have keys.
We own you. Yes, we have keys.
I'm gonna put some clothes on.
Forget your clothes.
And I quote, "You sure you wanna do this?"
And I quote, "I don't have a choice, but you do."
What the fuck do you think you're doing?
He should know what he's getting into.
Are those silk pajamas?
Looks even fancier in person.
Cashew.
No. Don't touch her.
Hey, there, little guy.
I've seen you before on camera, hmm?
Please put her down.
Don't take the chance.
I bought these shoes at J.C. Penney,
  with tax.
Rubber soles. You can clean 'em off with a hose.
Please, you're hurting her.
I have a pet, too. His name is Gavin Orsay.
Sit.
I said, "Sit."
Look what a good boy you are, Gavin.
Is that what you need me to do?
Quiet. When I say "fetch," you fetch.
And now we are going to fetch Lucas, just like we discussed.
If you try to bite my hand, I will put you to sleep.
Mind if I take a couple?
Doug Stamper, I'm the Vice President's Chief of Staff.
I know. Sit down.
My grandfather fought in the Revolution.
China was poor, then.
Sugar was hard to come by.
Now sugar's everywhere in China.
Do you like Old-Fashioneds?
No, thanks.
I've seen the news.
Your government was enthusiastic about our dropping the suit.
They've touted it as a victory back home.
It is a victory, but not the victory we wanted.
We're finding that difficult to believe.
By "we," you mean the Vice President.
I mean the American government.
Which he proclaims to represent.
He does. And I'm representing him.
Don't inflate your status, Mr. Stamper.
You're nothing but an errand boy.
Do you have a message for the Vice President?
If he represents the American government,
then why did he fail to communicate my request?
We question your legitimacy, Mr. Feng.
Nothing your delegation has done or said has,
in any way, supported your requests.
Smell that.
I use Macallan Rare and Fine,
You used to be an alcoholic, correct?
Not "used to be." Still am. A sober one.
Do you miss it?
Five thousand dollars you just spilled.
I'll send you a check.
I like you, Mr. Stamper, even if you're just an errand boy.
I'll ask you again.
What is your message for the Vice President?
There will be no Port Jefferson Bridge unless the lawsuit is reintroduced.
When you do, there will be those on the Standing Committee who protest,
but I'll manage them.
The majority want reform.
I'll tell the Vice President.
Mr. Stamper, one more message.
Please remind the Vice President that we are both here
at the behest of our mutual friend, Mr. Tusk.
If the Vice President fails to cooperate, I will simply bypass him.
Yes?
It's Doug.
Fine.
Spoke with Feng.
Here's your onion rings.
Did you know that General Longstreet was shot here,
accidentally, by his own men in the dark?
No...I didn't.
All right. Bring me up to date.
Where are we with Feng?
He wants us to resume the lawsuit.
So, he's sticking to his guns.
If we don't reintroduce it, there's no bridge project.
Well, that would greatly upset the President.
Do you want me to deliver Feng's message?
Absolutely not.
We want the President angry.
The tricky part is making sure he doesn't direct it toward me.
So what do you want me to do?
Get a hold of Cathy's people.
Do not mention the lawsuit at all.
Have them bring up the bridge instead.
Let's see if Feng is bluffing.
Yes, sir.
We must learn from Longstreet. He rode too high in the saddle.
If a bullet comes my way tomorrow,
it will not be an accident, and I must be quick to duck.
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.
Is the Vice President attending?
No, he's not. He's out of town.
I just decided to use his office
because it's a bit bigger than mine.
Please, sit.
I know this isn't the first conversation
you've had about sexual assault.
We've had a very open dialogue
with the Congresswoman for quite some time.
"Open" is one way to put it.
I think the Joint Chiefs have tolerated my concerns, but
To be fair, we've been quite responsive.
Over the past two years alone, we   
The Congresswoman has expressed her frustration to me
that there's still room for improvement.
Mrs. Underwood, if I may.
Please.
This is an issue we've grappled with seriously.
Increased education and prevention measures,
restructuring the reporting process,
insulating courts martial from abuse of power.
It's still not enough.
Civilian jurisdiction is not gonna happen.
We're all aware that's what the Congresswoman would prefer,
but we won't allow our cha  
Am I late?
It's my fault. The meeting got pushed up.
I meant to email you. I'm very sorry.
That's fine. Please, sit.
We didn't know you'd be attending, Mrs. Walker.
I'm sorry for interrupting.
Continue.
As I was saying,
putting sexual assault cases entirely in the hands of civilian courts
fundamentally erodes the military's ability to self-discipline.
What about civilian oversight instead of civilian courts?
That's a slippery slope.
There were those who said the same about racial integration.
Integration didn't change the core operational nature of the   
But it did prove that the military could shape its own evolution.
Absolutely. But in this case,
civilian oversight is not the answer.
My husband is a civilian who oversees the military.
Are you suggesting that
civilians can offer no guidance in matters like this?
Forgive me, Mrs. Walker. I didn't mean to suggest that at all.
Then maybe you should listen to the civilian sitting across from you.
Yes, ma'am.
This is from your own sexual assault prevention literature.
And in it, it says in some cases
it may be advisable to submit than to resist.
I think it's quite clear that there's still room for improvement.
Did you know about Xander Feng?
Not 'til I saw his name on the wire.,
He's been charged with corruption twice.
Both times the charges were dropped.
Do you know what happens in China if you're convicted?
  I'm guessing it's not good.   You die.
There you go.
We're talking about a man who's only one kangaroo court,
away from lethal injection,
who's filthy rich and clearly corrupt.
And this is who the Chinese send?
You're asking the wrong guy.
Stop dodging.
I passed a note in class. That's all.
We placed our faith in you, Frank.
We still have the rest of the day and all of tomorrow, Mr. President.
I need this bridge.
Otherwise, we have to stall my infrastructure program.
No foreign investment, no deficit reduction.
And the Chinese know this.
They're using it for leverage.
Yeah, but for what?
Well, that I'm not sure of.
Then why did we send you to Spotsylvania, Frank?
You're supposed to have answers to these questions.
Mr. President, I spoke to Mr. Feng an hour ago.
What'd he say?
Here comes the bullet.
He claims that Frank hasn't been delivering his messages properly.
I have conveyed his requests word for word.
He says you've been doing the opposite.
Whose responsible for the back-channeling here, me or Raymond?
You are, Frank.
I'm simply here to facilitate, not negotiate.
And yet you continue to have private conversations with
Beijing's supposed emissary.
Listen, Frank   
Are you prepared to trust Mr. Feng's word over mine, Raymond?
No one is doubting your word, Frank.
Well, if Feng is truly representing his government's interest,
then why is he telling Raymond one thing and telling me another?
How do you explain the bridge falling through?
Well, he personally profits from a free-floating currency,
just as anyone would who's in business with him,
such as yourself, Raymond.
The refinery and the bridge are two completely different issues.
Let's keep our focus, here.
I want the bridge back on the table, end of story.
  Catherine?   It'll be the first item I bring up in the morning.
Frank, stay put for now. But don't contact Feng.
And that goes for you, too, Raymond.
I don't want any more back-channeling until the bridge is revived.
And, Catherine, you communicate directly with me.
Yes, sir.
All right. We're done here.
The first drops of blood have been spilt.
Bullet grazed my cheek, but I haven't fallen.
Doug, find me a way to meet Feng.
We need to discuss something first.
What's wrong?
I just got off the phone with a guy named Seth Grayson.
I've spoken with my husband.
Doug told me. Thank you for fitting me in today.
  Is that it?   August '.
And why should we trust you?
There was evidence that Connor didn't make disappear.
I could've taken this to Us Weekly
and bought a new house.
Instead, I brought it to you.
And why didn't you apply when I was interviewing candidates?
There's no point. Willa doesn't like me.
I intimidate her.
That journal is my version of a resume.
Or extortion.
I'm not extorting you, Mrs. Underwood.
I'm just highlighting the difference
between a good choice and the right choice.
And tell me, how would we handle the repercussions
of firing our comm director three months after we hire him.
You don't fire him.
You tell him that you're bringing me on board to help with the workload.
He stays on with you. I cover your husband.
Connor will hate working with me.
I'll arrange a job offer elsewhere in a few months.
By the time it comes in, he'll want to move on.
Connor knows. What's to prevent him from going public?
I can handle Connor Ellis.
You just have to take me on my word on that. I 
Here's what I know.
It is far easier for you to destroy me than the other way around.
I have to speak to my husband.
Of course.
I didn't make any copies.
You have the only one.
Uh, Johnny Walker Black, neat.
  Where is it?   It's in my pocket.
Come on.
  Something up?   No. We're good to go.
You seem nervous.
Just because I've been breaking the law for  years
doesn't mean I don't still get nervous.
  Gavin.   Do not say my name.
Look at me.
It's gonna be fine. We practiced.
I'm confident. This is gonna work.
I got your drink.
He's more than qualified.
What do your instincts tell you?
That I just don't wanna end up more exposed.
Well, Grayson already knows.
I mean, if we don't exhibit some degree of   
Have Doug look into him.
Let's see if there's some leverage.
Yeah, but we don't know what he'll find
or when, or what he'll do in the meantime.
And that puts us into unchartered territory.
Well, Connor will expose us, too, if we let him go.
Not if it goes smoothly.
If we turn away Grayson now, we can't predict anything.
And, look, he has a lot less to lose than we do.
Okay. I just  I don't think we can trust him, Francis.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if Connor had done his job.
And I'd rather manage someone I don't trust
than someone who is reckless.
Fine. What's the next step?
I'd like to talk to Grayson myself first,
and then I'll have Doug talk to Connor.
How are you doing?
You been following the news?
Is it bad for us? Or good?
Could go either way.
I'm here if you need me.
I'm back tomorrow.
  I love you.   Love you, too.
  We all set?   All set, sir.
Let's go.
Oh, no, no. Turn those off.
Turn those off.
Where is he?
Right this way, sir.
Did Augustus play?
I like to think I did.
What's your own name?
When I'm here, I'm Augustus Underwood.
What's your real name?
Doesn't this feel real to you?
Will you show me where he died? The exact spot.
I will, sir.
I'm gonna pay respects to my ancestor.
I would appreciate a little privacy.
We'll wait here.
Little John on the move.
Just beyond those trees.
Thank you. I'll be good from here.
We're fine.
I hope you haven't waited long.
It's peaceful here. I didn't mind.
Peaceful now. Fifteen thousand men died in these woods.
My grandfather's grandfather died where we're standing.
My grandfather was killed in the Revolution.
So I've heard.
Do you fear death, Mr. Vice President?
No more or less than any man.
It motivates me. To experience everything,
accomplish all I can before it all vanishes.
I think you and I are similar in that regard.
Then why are we working at cross purposes?
Now what you mean is,
"Why am I not submitting to you and Mr. Tusk?"
You're sabotaging the negotiations.
And you're using them for your own personal ends.
Wrong. It's taken me seven years to convince the Standing Committee
that this was the right course of action.
A course of action that will earn you and Tusk billions.
Why did you want this meeting? Just to attack me?
To send a message to Raymond.
The President of the United States and I are not his puppets.
Now you tell him that.
Fine. The bridge deal is dead. There will be no saving it.
Stick a knife through its heart and put an apple in its mouth.
I won't shed a tear.
Your President will ascribe the failure to you.
I'll take the risk.
Think strategically, Mr. Vice President.
You're setting us on a very dangerous course.
Do you know how Grant defeated Lee?
He had more men. That's all.
And he was willing to let them die.
It was butchery, not strategy, which won the war.
Mr. Tusk and I have great resources at our disposal.
Add up all your billions together,
and you get the GDP of Slovakia.
I have the federal government of the United States of America.
Your money doesn't intimidate me.
The most that you can buy is influence.
But I wield Constitutional authority.
The strongest army doesn't always win.
Mao started out with only a few thousand men.
They took over half a continent.
Mao is dead. And so is his China.
But I'm not.
Not yet.
Don't forget. Your ancestor fought for the losing side.
There is no sacred ground for the conquered.
We have over , servers here, utilized by several hundred clients.
Everything from small businesses to major corporations.
What are some of the largest clients?
The largest here is AT T.
Their servers occupy more than half of the floor space.
And can you show me?
I am.
Right this way.
Did you or did you not meet with Feng last night?
Where is this coming from, Raymond?
Answer the question, Frank.
I have not contacted him since you and I spoke, Mr. President.
Just as you instructed me to do.
Not according to Feng.
I believe you were also instructed to avoid him too, Raymond.
He reached out to me. I just answered the call.
We had clear, prearranged terms, frank.
Months of back-channeling.
I am on the front lines, Mr. President.
And I can tell you firsthand
that we are dealing with a regime
that is not being forthright and
will seize upon the faintest whiff of trepidation.
This is a test.
To see how far they can push us before we break.
Do not play their game. End the talks.
We can't overreact here.
Well, they walked away from the Joint Commission.
We can walk away from the Summit.
The economic fallout would be catastrophic. The market would  
Or we can just kowtow and submit to the new reigning superpower.
Don't be hyperbolic, Frank.
Well, we are dealing with one quarter of the world's population.
Mr. President, you would be making a disastrous mistake.
Where are your allegiances, Raymond?
With Xander Feng or to the United   ?
Don't you dare question me about   
All right. Silence.
There were two mistakes. Both of them mine.
The first was allowing you, Raymond,
to enlist your business partner for these talks.
I was simply trying to   
And the second was enlisting you, Frank.
Instead of clarity,
we got miscommunication. That's poor diplomacy.
Mr. President, listen   
Oh, no. I've listened. To both of you.
And all I've heard is accusations.
Now if neither of you will take responsibility, I will.
We're pulling out.
That's not because you suggested it, Frank.
It's because you've made such a mess of these negotiations
that I have no other choice than a show of strength.
You've both disappointed me greatly.
Mr. President   
The President has left the call.
Raymond, are you still there?
That's the first time he's ever hung up on me
in  years.
Oh. I feel for you.
Goodbye, Frank.
And the butchery begins.
It's all the way down this row and the next seven rows over.
Now you wanted to see inside one, right?
Yeah, that would be great.
Go ahead.
There's not much to it, actually.
Just a lot of hard drives and wires.
So in terms of back-up, if the power goes down,
some natural disaster hits,
like a storm, or an earthquake, what exactly   ?
  On the ground.   Freeze!
  No, no, I   right now.
  On the ground! On the ground now!   I said on the fucking ground.
Why don't you ride back to D.C. with me?
We need to discuss something.
What's up?
We'll talk about it in the car.
Today, we break earth on the Overland Campaign Visitors Center.
So that generations to come
will fully absorb the importance of this hallowed ground,
the wilderness where the campaign commenced.
Augustus. Would you do the honor?
And now a moment of silence and prayer for the dead.
Thank you.
And God bless the United States of America.
I just heard.
We got Lucas Goodwin.House.of.Cards.SE
We've got an energy crisis, Frank.
Now what the White House needs to   
The president chose to remain tough on China.
No. You forced him to.
You chose Feng. You're the one who put me in a room with him.
The cook can't blame his ingredients
if he doesn't like how they taste together.
If Samarium prices don't reduce,
the market will have no choice but to compensate.
That's bad for everyone who owns an air conditioner.
You should speak to the president himself.
the president hasn't placed much value on my advice lately.
I'm in the same boat as you, Raymond.
Yeah.
Difference being you've got an office three doors down from the Oval.
Let's work together, for Christ sakes.
I'm wiling to put Spotsylvania behind us if you are.
I want nothing more.
Then you'll talk to him?
Look, I'm late for a meeting, Raymond.
Yes or no, Frank?
I can't guarantee he'll listen.
That's not a yes.
But it's better than a no.
Any pugilist worth his salt knows when someone's on the ropes,
that's when you throw a combination to the gut
and a left hook to the jaw.
Samarium is the last thing they'll let go of.
As long as our energy prices rise, they have the leverage.
Why don't we offer nothing? Move toward attrition.
If China doesn't show at the refunding auction,
long-term interest rates will spike.
And in a week yields on our  year notes
will pierce the seven-percent threshold.
That could happen.
But if we go soft now, that will happen.
You mean go on the offensive.
We should at least consider it.
The Chinese don't like carrots. Let's see how they like the stick.
Well, what might that look like?
We could raise inspection rates on foodstuffs.
Hold them in our ports till they rot.
How much of a raise?
Bury the move with increased spot checks all the way around.
These sort of tactics don't solve the immediate problem.
People are paying triple the standard rate for electric.
We'll hit a five-fold increase by August.
What if you, Mr. President, by executive order,
purchase Samarium through a third party?
Cut the Chinese out.
Force them to either raise their prices worldwide
or lower them to keep direct flow with us.
We stockpile Samarium for denfense purposes, of course,
And quietly sell what we don't need to our friends in nuclear energy.
At a discount.
A subsidy for nuclear power?
The richest of the rich? How's that gonna play?
We're dealing with a national crisis.
We can't get sidetracked with public opinion.
It would show China we're willing to wait this out.
Do we have the resources?
I'd have to run the numbers,
anticipate fluctuations, consider different models   
Your best guess.
We do. For a moderate stockpile.
All right. Draw up a request from the Defense Department.
  Yes, sir.   Linda, draft the executive order.
And Cathy, make sure we have a third-party conduit
to purchase the Samarium.
We'll go through India.
Well, that won't fly well with Pakistan.
I'll alert them in advance. As long as they're in the loop,
we'll be all right. Not that we owe them any favors.
All right. Let's get to work.
Come on, Betsy. Three additional counts under Section E?
Three is low. It reflects a narrow interpretation of criminal intent.
Your client broke into a data center.
What's the offer?
I'm not doing a plea.
Let me handle this.
They don't want a trial.
The questions I'll be raising loud and clear in open court...
Lucas, please.
We have our own questions, Mr. Goodwin.
For example, what were you doing with these?
I didn't take these.
They were in your apartment.
Underwood took them.
Do you really expect a jury to believe that?
He did. They were having an affair   
Or are they gonna see them for what they are?
Proof of our obsession with Ms. Barnes
and the ludicrous conspiracy you have concocted
to explain her death.
Tell us what you're offering.
Your client pleads to one count under Section E
for breaking into a data center,
one count for fraud, for stealing the password from the Herald.
Eligible for parole in seven.
I'd like to speak to my client, alone.
Cameras and recording equipment off, please.
I'll introduce the president, then he'll introduce you.
If he's there, we can't mention the military.
Just the endemic problem nationwide.
Of course. I understand.
Good. So we should go through these speeches
and make sure that there's nothing   
Hi, Mrs. Underwood.
Hello, Christina.
Mrs. Walker, you asked for me?
We need to confirm whether the president's going
to make it to New Orleans.
This Friday, correct?
Yes. But I know he had a cabinet meeting this morning,
so I imagine...
I'll talk to Linda right away.
Thanks.
I know you want Garrett there. But with this energy crisis...
No. It's not that.
What?
I shouldn't say anything.
Well, now you have to tell me.
I've just never been very fond of her. Christina.
Why not?
Peter Russo.
I just have a thing about women who sleep with their bosses.
Anyway, I'm sure whatever they had was genuine.
It's none of my business, 'cause if she's doing a good job,
that's all that matters, right?
Garrett seems to think she is.
Then I should just keep my feelings to myself.
So if the president is not able to be there,
that could be a silver lining for us.
We won't have to hold back with the military.
Phone taps. Video surveillance. Premeditation.
Sustained intent. They've got you cold.
If I plead out, that's it. No one hears the truth.
If you don't plead, no one will hear you, period.
Not until you're in your s.
Have you talked to Hammerschmidt yet?
You're in no position to make demands.
It's not up to you.
All you'll do is piss them off.
Look,
we've got a good deal here.
A great deal, considering what you did.
You should take it before their change their mind.
Tom Hammerschmidt.
I talk to him, or we're going to trial.
Raise your arms, please.
You have something here?
My neck chain.
May I see it?
Really? I gotta take off my tie.
I need to see it, sir.
You're a good Christian, Remy.
My mother's. She was the good Christian.
Well, then you're just the good son.
Thank you, sir.
Hot out there, huh?
We had heat like that back in Gaffney,
but we didn't know what air conditioning was,
so we just accepted as fact that summer was meant to be miserable.
Neat or with water?
Just the water. You can hold the bourbon.
We need to find a solution
so that this one isn't miserable for  million people.
I already have found a solution.
Oh, please, Frank. A Samarium subsidy?
Is that your skepticism or Raymond's?
Mine. Anticipating his.
So you haven't spoken to him yet.
I want to offer him something he can agree to.
Well, he doesn't have much of a choice.
Why are you cornering him?
I'm cutting the rate by half. I'd call that liberating him.
You know that's not how he'll see it.
This trade war is preventing the refinery
from being approved in Beijing.
His co-venture with Feng is not our highest priority right now.
A rare earth refinery solves this crisis permanently.
Three years from now. Not this summer.
It's not just that. With the subsidy he'll break even at best,
there's no point in doing business to hover between red and black.
Raymond's profits are an even lower priority to me than his co-venture.
Tell me what you're up to, Frank.
There's nothing to gain by locking horn with Tusk.
Ask your client. It's Tusk who's locking the horns.
He's not a man who likes conflict.
Neither am I.
Then make the ask. 'Cause I know you don't care about the subsidy.
This is about something bigger.
I'm a good Christian, Remy, like your mother.
I would tell you the truth if I wanted more.
You trying to send a message?
Perhaps.
Which is?
That stubbornness is far more costly than obedience.
Thanks for the water.
You're on the wrong side, Remy.
Yeah, well, one of us sure is.
And when the bumblebee flew home,
all his friends were waiting with buckets honey, right?
And he's got his worm friend and his mouse friend
and his spider friend and his snail friend.
And they all had tons of honey. And he looks happier now, right?
  Yeah!   Yeah?
And so they all buzzzzed with happiness.
Because life is sweet when you spend it with your friend.
Right?
Can you all buzz your wings? Buzz your little wings.
  I think it would make a fluttering noise, like...   like
I don't know.
Your flutters?
It's too hot out here for you to be doing this, Francis.
I'm keeping hydrated.
Is that even regulation?
It's only half.
But I don't want the press to see practicing on the street.
You remember when you threw out that first pitch in Greenville?
I was wondering how long it was gonna take you to bring that up.
That wasn't even on national television.
Good luck.
Thank you.
What happened in Greenville?
The Greenville Drive.
Single A team for the Red Sox.
It was a home game. I get on the mound.
You threw from the mound?
Well, I wanted to throw a real pitch.
Didn't make it.
Not even close.
Halfway?
Ball slipped out of my hand just before I released it.
Went straight up in the air.
Hit me on top of the head. The whole stadium burst a gut laughing.
Comic relief pitcher.
That's very clever, Meechum.
Don't tell Claire.
I heard that.
You're really good with them.
Did you see Robbie when they were finger-painting?
He pulled down his pants and started painting himself blue.
  No.   Yeah.
Hope I got it all off.
I'm sure Alex and Daria don't care.
They let him run around naked all the time.
Yeah, but probably not with his Smurf ass.
What do we want to do for dinner tonight?
I've got some leftover chicken. Or we could order pizza.
Pizza. No dishes.
Yeah.
I'm really sorry.
I    I totally forgot I've got a friend picking me up tonight.
I    I completely blanked.
  That's fine.   I'm really sorry.
Don't sweat it. Is it, uh, your boyfriend?
No, no. Um, just an old friend.
Can I meet him?
he's kinda shy. I do   I don't know if he'd be up for   
Totally cool. Don't worry about it.
We'll just do dinner another night.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah. You know where I'll be.
How long?
Couple of months.
Why didn't you tell me?
I can't go to church?
Anywhere you interact with other people opens us up to risk.
Right. I'm just supposed to slave away at the fucking call center
and then lock myself in the apartment.
Don't get dramatic.
I like the fellowship.
Okay? There    there's nothing to worry about there.
All it takes is one person's cousin to visit from Lynchburg.
Someone you went to high school with
or some client that you spend the night with.
Those guys would never end up here.
You don't know that.
Yeah. I do.
You ended up here, didn't you?
I can't live like this.
What?
I can't live like this.
Yes, you can. You're a strong girl.
That's it? That's everything?
I know. You've heard it before.
As a friend, Lucas. Not as a reporter.
Now I dig.
I make the phone calls. I do the legwork.
They treating you okay?
It's fine.
That's not what I asked.
They're pushing the plea deal pretty hard.
How seriously are you considering it?
I want to see how this article impacts things.
What does your lawyer say?
He thinks that's a bad idea. That I should take the plea.
Maybe you should listen to him.
No. I want the article. That I'm certain of.
All right. I better get to it then.
Thank you.
You need to know,
I'm gonna treat this the way I would any other story.
Whatever the facts bear. You might not like what I write.
I get that.
I'll let you read it first. Then you can decide.
That's all I'm asking.
Hang in there.
Can you wipe this off? Please?
And the other nuclear providers are on board?
Most. Except Raymond's company.
Couple of others.
Lakeport Nuclear. Wolf Springs.
Now, I can't prove it, but I am absolutely sure they're colluding.
Raymond wants to embarrass me.
I offer a solution, nuclear lobby turns its back.
He has the right to refuse, Mr. President.
What he cannot do is manipulate the energy market.
You want to put pressure on the distribution side.
More than pressure. Ban vertical integration entirely.
We don't have that regulatory power.
We add an antitrust agreement to the Emergency Energy Bill.
We break up the regional supply and distribution monopolies,
like the Bell System.,
It'll be challenged immediately in the courts.
We don't need it to pass. We just need to threaten it.
See if he falls into line.
Is there a way to do that without it making its way into the news?
I don't want the world's wealthiest one percent on my phone sheet.
There is absolutely a way to do that, sir.
Here you go.
Crowded for a Tuesday night.
We keep it at  degrees. And it's free.
If you call  bucks for a vodka soda free.
Still cheaper than a Pepco bill.
Depends on how many you have?
You trying to get us drunk?
Drunker you are, bigger your tip.
I don't have to be drunk to appreciate good service.
I'll get your change.
No, you won't.
Thank you.
You're shameless.
Makes me a good lobbyist. Cheers.
So, Jackie, bold move, but it won't work.
You know we can pass this amendment in a heartbeat.
Maybe. But no one'll comply.
It'll get overturned. Big fuss for nothing.
It might get overturned. But it gets ink along the way.
One thing I learned about Raymond Tusk
is he doesn't two bird shits about public opinion.
His stockholders do.
They'd jump in a pit of snakes
and light themselves on fire if he gave the word.
All I'm asking if that you convey our intentions.
Why me? Frank could easily pick up the phone.
You still call him Frank?
Not to his face, which I try to keep to a minimum.
Don't you appreciate having an ear in the White House?
I wouldn't, if I had an ear. But lately all I've got is a mouth.
Yeah. He's not the best listener, is he?
Try working for him.
You were on his staff?
Eight years. Press secretary. Before you joined Congress.
That explains a lot.
Like what?
Like a lot.
I'll take that as an insult.
You should.
That's it? You're abandoning me?
No. I'm buying the next round.
I can't accept gifts from lobbyists without reciprocating.
Plus, I'm a good wingman.
This gets you more face time with the barmaid.
You already got 'em ready?
Your guys gave me the heads-up you were coming.
Well, I hope that they didn't wake you earlier than usual.
Fuck, man. With this heat I ain't sleeping much anyway.
What? No AC at home?
Oh, I got a unit. I just don't want to pay the damn bill.
It's not too bad in here, all things considered.
That's 'cause we in the shade.
When you get outside a couple hours from now on that pavement,
fry your damn dick off from three feet below.
Must be bad over that grill.
I can't tell the difference no more.
I tell you what, though.
Stuff goes down aroundhere when the mercury pop a hundred.
Man who beat his wife at home will beat her right out on the street.
Brings out the animal in us.
It ain't no joke.
What used to wake me up? Gunshots.
Now you know what does? People fucking.
Moaning and screaming like god damn cats in the alley.
When you get hot and sweaty,
it make you ripe and ready.
I drank too much.
We both did.
Last night didn't happen.
I know.
When I walk out that door, it's business as usual.
No special treatment.
Don't worry. You won't need a restraining order.
I'm surprised you didn't go for the waitress.
You're much sexier.
Yeah, okay.
She works for tips. You run Congress.
Only half of it.
That's half more than she does.
So it's not my body.
Those legs don't hurt.
You're so full of shit.
Okay. It's your voice.
My voice?
It does something to me.
Let me know what Tusk has to say.
Business hasn't started. You haven't walked out that door yet.
Watch me.
Thank you, Jackie.
We're going to the White House.
Little John on the move.
We raise the bet. We get FERC involved.
An investigation?
We don't need Congress to activate the Regulatory Commission.
But a price-fixing review? That would take months.
Again, it's the threat. Not the actuality.
He'll employ the same logic.
Draw it out. Fight back with appeals.
But he'll have to divulge his accounting
if FERC takes action.
Now, no businessman wants to open up his books,
especially one with   billion.
This is getting outta hand, Frank.
We shouldn't be duking it out with Raymond.
Maybe we should talk to him.
That's exactly what he wants. To force himself back into the mix.
What's to be gained by shutting him out?
The simple lesson that you cannot strong-arm
the president of the United States.
We can't devolve to a pissing contest.
I'm gonna call Raymond. Invite him to Washington.
He won't accept anything but total surrender.
I'm making the call.
Don't put yourself in that position.
I know how to maintain the integrity of my office. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Two minutes with the president,
and Tusk may be back in his good graces.
I need to disrupt the nuptials and prevent a second marriage.
Christina?
Good to see you.
Please. You look great.
Thank you.
How are things?
Great. Linda works me to the bone,
but that's what I signed up for.
Well, from what I've heard, you're doing a great job.
Oh, that's really nice to hear.
Look, I wanted to talk to you about Tricia.
I'm sure you've noticed that she's still sort of adjusting to her role.
You mean her confidence?
I think it would be great if you reached out to her.
Just let her know that you're there if there's anything that she needs.
I don't really know her that well. I mean, we've met, but I...
That's okay.
Maybe just tell her that you enjoy working for the president
and you're there to be of help to her in any way you can.
  You don't think that's a little    I don't know    brash?   No.
For me to just approach her like that?
No. Not at all.
You've reached the Skorsky residence.
Leave a message after the beep.
Tom Hammerschmidt again. Still trying to reach Janine.
Still important. Thank you.
Hammerschmidt's been calling our press office all day.
I don't want a story to come out any more than you do.
We lose a major asset if it does.
Can you squash it for security reasons?
Not once it's been shared with the press. First Amendment crap.
Ward isn't making things any easier.
She wants a notch in her belt.
We're giving her one.
Not Goodwin. She wants Orsay.
Most Wanted list for six years.
I'll handle Hammerschmidt.
You need to make sure Goodwin takes the plea.
If  with no parole doesn't scare the piss out of him,
I don't know what will.
Then don't try to scare him.
Remove hope from equation.
I tried to keep this contained.
I didn't anticipate Hammerschmidt.
Is Ms. Skorsky cooperating with him?
He's called her.
My guy at the bureau said they haven't actually spoken.
At least not on the phone.
If this goes to court...
That won't happen, sir.
It will if he publishes.
I'm bringing this to you because I can't control Hammerschmidt.
I don't know what to do.
We need to invite a full-frontal attack. Then hold the line.
You want to speak to him?
Face to face. Just the two of us.
I don't think that's a good idea, sir.
You have a better idea?
No, sir.
We can't avoid the battle, but we can choose the battlefield.
Set up a meeting at the White House.
We'll intimidate him with formality.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Vice President?
I know you don't have patience for apologies,
but I'm sorry if I've let you down in any way.
Let's concentrate on what's in front of us.
I'll let you know when I have a time set up.
  Soon as possible.   Yes, sir.
So this is a sort of outline to the larger piece?
With questions on the next page.
We're off the record.
Yes. Off the record.
Now, Tom, I know that you care about this young man,
and I respect you as a journalist.
But these questions?
Why don't you just ask me
when I stopped strangling people's pets.
Sir, the death of Congressman Russo   
You mean my friend, Peter Russo,
whose suicide left two small children with no father.
No, I will not answer questions about that.
Yes? I'm aware of that. No. Tell her I'll call her right back.
Two minutes. Secretary Durant.
I can wait outside for you to call her back   
No, let's finish.
Now,
if you decide to print any of this,
assuming you find an outlet that's willing to,
then, yes, it might cause me a headache for a day.
But I will not engage.
And I think it will only prove to highlight
how ridiculous Mr. Goodwin's claims are. I pity him.
I truly do. I think he needs help.
I've interviewed many mentally ill people. He's not one of them.
Well, I would suggest that you read your own article again.
He's distressed. There's a difference.
Look, I understand. It must be a terrible blow to see him in prison.
But, Tom...
Rachel Posner exists.
I haven't been able to find her, but I've proven she's not a fantasy.
The same goes for Roy Kapeniak. These people were born.
They have social security numbers, past addresses, past   
And so does everyone from California to Maine.
Have I conspired with all of them?
You have to admit there are some troubling details regarding the DUI.
You know, people say the same thing about Area .,
You can conjure up little gray men if you really want to.
Did you kill Peter Russo?
Tom, you're embarrassing yourself.
Did you kill Zoe Barnes?
I've given you more time than this nonsense deserves.
I have to ask these questions.
Well, the only question I would ask is
does this sort of article hurt or help Mr. Goodwin?
You have to do what you think is    is right.
But I hope you can understand
if I don't demean myself by taking any of it seriously.
I appreciate your time, Mr. Vice President.
How did it go?
I did my part. Now put it to bed, Doug.
I won't submit myself to this sort of exposure again.
Yes, sir.
Has Tusk met with the president yet?
Linda said they're meeting at :.
Call Remy. Make sure he doesn't get on his plane before I see him.
I'm on it.
Oh, Mrs. Walker?
I just wanted to say how rewarding it's been,
working here in the West Wing.
And I'm so proud to be working for your husband.
Thank you. I know he appreciates all your hard work.
Well, now that I'm working so closely with him,
if there's anything I can do for you,
anything that would make yours or his life easier...
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Truly, anything.
I want you to know you can rely on me. Both of you.
I know that. Thank you, Christina.
Thanks, Mrs. Walker.
  Oh, here. Let me.   Oh, it's just my hands.
  Are they bothering you?   Yeah. Probably gonna get rain tonight.
I'll get it.
Um, no. Just, uh, keep the broth moving.
Agent Green, FBI.
Do you have a moment, Ms. Skorsky?
Yeah. I...
May we come in?
I just need to turn the stove off.
  Stay in here, Mom.   Who is it?
Just stay in here.
Only that once?
And I haven't seen him since, or returned his calls.
How many times has he tried to call you?
I don't know. Eight or nine times, maybe.
And then he stopped after a while.
Did he mention anything about Hieronymus Bot or Gavin Orsay?
You know, I think I should talk to a lawyer.
Right now you're not suspected of being an accomplice.
If you call a lawyer, we might have to reconsider.
  He mentioned some hacker.   Hieronymus.
I told him I thought it was a bad idea to contact him.
Are you aware of what he's claiming?
No.
That you and he were working together.
That you believe in this conspiracy theory.
That it was you who received explicit photos of Ms. Barnes.
Is any of that true?
We need you to come back to D.C. with us
and sign this statement in the presence of the U.S. attorney.
  You want me to call him a liar.   Isn't he?
I can't do that to him.
We also need you to speak with Tom Hammerschmidt.
You know what? Please, can you just keep me out of this?
I had nothing to do with the hacker or the...
Ms. Skorsky, we want to believe you,
and we will if you put all of it in writing.
He's not a criminal. You're going after the wrong person.
And if you think that you can intimidate me,
harass me like this in my own home,
I will file a formal complaint.
You're starting to sound an awful lot like him.
You can't arrest me. I haven't done anything.
I'd like you to leave.
I have a right to legal counsel, and you haven't presented a warrant.
We can arrest you, Ms. Skorsky,
for abetting an act of cyber terrorism.
Who's going to take care of your mother while you're
spending the next three years in courtrooms?
Would you please raise your arms?
  No, Meechum.   Sir...
Meechum. I know you don't want to shake my hand,
so we'll just skip that part.
The president didn't mention anything about it.
Why would he? The better to catch you off-guard.
Then why would you?
So we can avoid unnecessary conflict.
Garrett's not a good liar.
The gift of a good liar is making people think
you lack a talent for lying.
I know him far better than you
and so I know what talents he has and lacks.
But let's assume he did lie.
I'm not intimidated by a FERC investigation.
You'd have grid overload and brown-outs
before you could even get a hearing.
You are deliberately keeping electric prices at inflated rates,
which is illegal.
No. I'm responding to free market.
A regulated free market.
Why are you doing this, Frank?
Remy asked me the same thing.
You're making this about me.
This isn't personal, Raymond.
The integrity of our energy markets is my only concern.
Of course it's personal.
I asked you personally to convince Garrett to pull back from China.
You personally chose not to.
You personally sabotaged the summit.
  I have never once in my political career allow   And you personally advised the cabinet
  personal feelings to get in the way of pragmatic...   to push me up against the wall.
Do not try and spin me, Frank. I am too old to tango.
Then I'll be blunt.
Accept the subsidies or deal with FERC.
There is no third way here.
Are you intentionally trying to destroy the president?
I'm trying to protect the president. From you.
This is about the secretary of state nomination, isn't it?
I'm the vice president now, Raymond.
I don't cry over what happened in kindergarten.
You're vice president because I vouched for you.
Because you had no other options.
Political necessity.
You have  hours to decide.
I'll show myself out.
Hello.
Raymond, this is Claire.
Mrs. Underwood, it is an honor.
Jean   my wife   has been very taken with your recent efforts.
Well, I'd like to meet her one day.
She would very much like that, I'm sure.
And what about you?
I'm sorry?
What are your thoughts about our recent efforts?
Oh. I am in favor of anything that prevents unnecessary violence.
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Underwood.
And, good luck with that first pitch tonight, Mr. Vice President.
Make it to the plate this time. Ma'am.
This Kevlar is cooking me.
We have to use it, sir.
Well, I didn't practice with it, and now I can hardly rotate my arm.
I should have mentioned it. I apologize.
If this ball doesn't make it over the plate, it's your ass.
And what are you doing here? Don't you have things to do?
Never been to Camden Yards.
Ladies and gentlemen, here to throw out the first pitch tonight,
we are honored to introduce the vice president of the United States,
Frank Underwood.
Boss, boss. Meechum's ball.
Thank you very much. Where's the mascot?
Beautifully done.
Good evening.
Now I know it's a hot night and you all want to get to the baseball.
So as soon as I throw this sucker,
grab a drink, enjoy the game,
and best of luck to both teams.
Scratch that. We're at Camden Yards.
Go Orioles!
Go, go!
I'm told the distribution line that controls
the pinch point caused the outages.
BAPCO. One of your companies.
Yes, sir. There was a capacity issue.
We're working as quickly as we can to resolve it.
Well, I've got three governors calling.
Hospitals on emergency power. So quickly better mean quickly.
The latest estimate I got was two to three hours, maybe sooner.
Raymond, was this intentional?
Sir, I know you don't hold me in the highest regard at the moment.
But I am alarmed that you could even entertain such a thought.
Yeah, well, the timing makes coincidence hard to swallow.
There is a heat wave. That always pushes the grid to its limits.
All right, let's get the people out of the dark.
Updates every  minutes on your progress.
I should inform you, sir, that I may need to take
two of my plants offline tomorrow for unscheduled maintenance.
Why? Which ones?
Georgia and Tennessee.
This blackout has put a great deal of stress on them.
My engineers are concerned about the seals on the fuel rods.
So we're looking at outages on the southeast grid, too?
Could be. For a few days.
No, that's unacceptable.
Safety comes first. We don't want an accident.
All right, let's get a full report to Linda, ASAP.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
He's toying with you.
No, this could be a legitimate safety issue.
He wants a seat back at the table. Those plants are fine.
Why is he doing this? We've had our differences,
but something drastic like this?
Well, I did tell him about the possible FERC action.
You did what?
Well, he called me. I answered the call.
Why didn't you inform me immediately?
He told me you had a productive talk.
That he was on board with the subsidy. I assumed everything was fine.
He was proposing renewed trade talks.
We didn't talk about the subsidy at all.
He's playing both of us then.
If he told you he was on board,
why'd you bring up FERC?
I told him I was relieved.
That we could have taken action if he didn't comply.
You think he's fishing?
To see what our next move might be?
I think so, sir. I mean,
he is lying about those two plants in the south.
Well, we can't guess. We have to be certain.
Well, do you want Raymond Tusk to assess that risk?
Or the United States government?
Are you suggesting we take over his facilities?
There is precedent there.
Woodrow Wilson did it with the railroads for three full years.
In a time of war.
In a time of emergency, which is what this is.
The country needs a leader, Mr. President.
Give them one. Do not bend to Raymond Tusk.
I'm done.
I said you might not like it.
It makes me seem crazy.
This is the most toned-down version.
I tried to be as kind as I could without being biased.
I don't think you want this going out into the world.
Can I talk to Janine?
Tell him to go.
He wants you to leave.
  You lied.   Lucas...
You lied to Tom. You lied to the U.S. Attorney.
  I didn't know what else to do.   Tell the truth.
They'll arrest me. They'll discredit everything I say.
And nobody is going to believe me more than they believe you.
But we can get the story out there. Get people asking questions.
No. It'll just look like two crazy people instead of one.
So you're saving yourself.
I'm trying to save the both of us.
Please.
Take the plea.
  I'm not guilty.   You are.
You committed a crime.
  Multiple crimes.   Not murder.
Take the plea. Be good. Get out early.
Everybody    everybody's fucked me.
If I was trying to fuck you I wouldn't be here.
He's gonna get away with it, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
  Take an iced tea if you have any.   We don't.
I wish I didn't have to keep coming through back doors like this.
Well, we wouldn't want our friends in the fourth estate
to know you were here, would we?
Especially since you've gone to such lengths
to remain above the fray of politics.
You can't seize the plants, Frank.
We haven't seized anything yet.
We're ready to, but we won't if you cooperate.
It's illegal.
It's not. You know that.
The president can issue an executive order in times of emergency.
I'll fight it in court.
Which will take even longer than a FERC investigation would.
And in the meantime, you make nothing from those plants.
We agreed.
Right here in this room, we agreed to work together.
We agreed as men of our word.
And I held up my end of that bargain
  until you abandoned me on the bill.   I sent Remy to help you.
After I got it passed through the Senate with no help from you.
I had to protect my relationship with the president.
And then you tried to use me during the summit in Spotsylvania.
I was not put on this earth to be your best friend
or to share every piece of information I have with you.
We agreed to a mutually beneficial partnership. That's all.
Yes. And what's become very clear to me
is that I benefit in no way from this partnership.
Let's not pretend to be naive.
We both respect self-interest above all else.
Our versions of that no longer align.
You are on the verge of making an irreversible mistake,
Mr. Vice President.
I may well be making a mistake. Who knows?
What I do know is that you'll be calling Linda
and telling her that you'll accept the subsidies.
You may have all the money, Raymond,
but I have all the men with guns.
It's a burner, pre-dialed. She's expecting.
Oh, and, uh, yes. From last night.
The ball's in your court, as they say.
Oh, Jesus Christ. You scared the shit outta me.
Are you supposed to take the lord's name in vain like that?
Leave it on.
It costs too much.
I'll take care of it.
Goodwin took the plea. He's going away.
So does that mean this is all over?
No. We still have to be careful.
But why? If he's gone, then nobody's looking for me, right?
Not that we know of.
Until we know, nothing changes.
So what, you just came over here to get my hopes up?
I came here to make sure that you don't go to church tonight.
Do you want to fuck me?
  Is that what this is all about?   No.
You've done it before.
That was different.
Stop it.
If there's one thing I know, it's when a man wants me.
I learned who Rachel was in church.,
She was young and beautiful.
Jacob fell in love with her while she was watering a lamb.
And she became his wife after he worked seven years
to earn her hand in marriage.
Rachel had one son. Joseph.
He became a king.
Are you hungry?House.of.Cards.SE
Jackie Sharp.
Terry Womack.
Bob Birch.
President Walker has surrounded himself with a broken Congress.
He even brought one of them into the White House.
Now, they've broken the economy
and put us on a collision course with China.
Put a stop to them before it's too late.
Send a message at the midterms.
Let's start fixing the country.
Paid for by Friends of a Better America.
Twenty-five million? Out of thin air?
  That's our estimate.   Where is the money coming from?
  Super PACs.   These are issue-based attack ads.
So who's giving to them?
We can't trace the money until this quarter's filings come in.
We get killed in the midterms, we can kiss  goodbye.
You can deal with the republican majority and a Republican president.
We're trying to counter with D-trip.
Make  million appear out of nowhere?
  We can make a dent.   Dents don't cut it.
Well, no matter how fast we ramp up fundraising,
we can't close the gap.
We have to stop their money flow.
I want to know how.
Locate the source and then cut off the tap.
With this sorta influx you can be sure that
somebody's not playing by the rules,
but we can't whistle-blow until we find the source.
Then find it. And you sure as hell better find it soon.
In the meantime, I've been working on a proposal to counter the attacks.
A coordinated national messaging effort.
I'll be sending all of you copies later today.
Well, we should be open to every idea.
Now, go. Get to work.
Frank.
You were supposed to steer Congress on my behalf.
No one is as concerned as me.
I shoulda kept you in the house,
like Raymond suggested from day one.
But you've been distracted by the Senate, State of the Union,
meddling with foreign diplomacy.
  You asked me to negotiate     I know what I've done.
And I know where it's gotten us.
Sir, the attack ads are not a result of anything  
You're scrambling from fire to fire instead of preventing them.
I'm not the FEC, I can't wave a wand  
Give me more than excuses, Frank! You're better than that!
Or maybe you're not.
If you need a punching bag,
I will stand here and take the punches,
as I have done time and time again, since I swore my oath.
But I would much rather get back to work, as you've asked me to do.
You are out of line, Frank.
Dismiss me or keep swinging, Mr. President.
You're dismissed.
Thank you, sir.
Dan Lanagin switched teams.
That doesn't make any sense.
I couldn't find any anomalies among big Republican donors,
so I checked our own.
Lanagin hasn't given a dime this quarter.
Yeah, but not giving isn't the same as giving to the Republicans.
His casino's accounts. Ernst and Young.
Eighteen million for donations, and they're not going to us.
How did you get your hands on those?
I've got friends. That's why you solicit my services.
The estimate for the ad buys was  million.
Those accounts are up to date as of June th.
They could have made more donations since then.
Tusk.
Lanagin's casino is in Missouri.
Raymond Tusk?
He's got an axe to grind with me and with the president.
I've never seen his name on any FEC filings.
He doesn't make political contributions.
That's how he remains flexible.
You think he's funneling the money somehow?
I don't know.
Get yourself to Kansas City. I want you in that casino.
  Yes, sir.   I'll keep digging.
Get me my wife.
  Where'd you get the recipe?   My father taught me.
  You and your dad were close?   Nah.
Cooking ribs was the only thing that motherfucker did right.
  I guess you can't print that.   I have ways.
This really gonna be in the paper?
At least in Boston, yeah.
Don't see why anybody would care.
Well, it's a personal interest story.
The vice president of the United States comes here, of all places.
  You mean this shithole?   That's not what I said.
It's OK.
It's not the Taj Mahal.
How long has he been coming?
About  years now.
  He's a good man, Frank.   You still call him Frank?
Hey, in this joint, I'm the president,
the vice president and the Congress.
He just another customer. A loyal one.
You think that's why he likes it here?
'Cause you treat him like a regular person?
Maybe. Mostly it's the fuckin' ribs, though.
Now, if unemployment goes up more than two-tenths,
I want the Fed to consider...
Get you something, hon.
Club soda with lime, please?
  That's it?   Yeah.
  Nothing to eat?   No. That's it.
Tough spot to hang out if you're in the program.
  How'd you know?   Takes one to know one, right?
  How long?   Little over a year. You?
Going on .
Any luck with the ponies?
None. Not yet.
Pick a number. One through twelve.
Hot Fuss.
Sounds about right.
Club soda coming up, darling. With lime.
Hasn't moved the last two hours.
And he hasn't spoken to anybody?
Just been betting on the races.
You want us to bring him in?
No. That's the vice president's chief of staff.
Really?
We don't want to make a scene. Just keep an eye on him.
Let me know what he does, where he goes, and who he talks to.
You got it, Mr. Lanagin.
You should've seen their faces.
They didn't know what to think.
Especially when I made 'em hold the bag.
You tried it out?
I sure as hell did.
I'm sorry I lashed out at you, Frank.
No. I was disrespectful, and that was uncalled for.
My temper's gotten away from me these days.
I need to be jolted back into reality sometimes.
It was a    a kind gesture.
Oh, just some good old fun.
Tricia tells me we're having dinner later this week.
Yes. Claire tells me the same.
Well, it'll be good to get out of this place for a few hours.
It's been here since Kennedy.
It was painted the same year he was born.
It depicts, I think, a World War I parade.
Oh, I should know every painting.
Well, you seem to know quite a lot, at least about this one.
Oh, I try to soak it all in while I can.
All the history.
Presidents who obsess over history
obsess about their place in it,
instead of forging it.
Who said that?
I did. Just now.
Ah, the White House. All day long it's buzzing,
and at this hour it's so desolate.
The presidency is a great and precious thing.
Loneliness is the price.
Let's assume
in one of these chairs, staring at this wall,
is where Truman decided to drop the bomb.
And see if we feel anything.
Nothing. You?
No.
Sorry, it's a mess.
You don't have to clean up for me.
Yes, I do.
Wouldn't want you seeing these.
I wore 'em last night.
You like these or you want the ones I'm wearing now?
How long you been working in the casino?
Too long.
Bet you've seen a lot.
Oh, yeah. I've seen everything.
I should get going. Got an early meeting.
Okay.
Do you want me to stay?
I wasn't planning on sleeping here.
So, uh, another one-night stand then, huh?
Is that okay?
Not really my thing.
Come on. You must play the field.
No, I don't.
But you are such a flirt.
I flirt, yes.
But I only sleep with someone if I'm into them.
And I prefer to stick around.
Remy Danton, serial monogamist.
This a joke?
I'm sorry. I didn't, uh... sorry.
This doesn't happen again unless it's leading somewhere.
I'm upfront about what I want, in all things.
Not just politics.
Three or four times a year they fly in about a dozen Chinese guys.
Money to burn.
They got a whole floor of the casino reserved just for them.
Word is they throw away millions.
Well, that doesn't necessarily mean anything.
The Chinese love to gamble. Especially the rich ones.
Yeah, in Vegas.
This is Missouri. It's a much longer flight.
I want to find out   
I want to find out
where these planes are coming from.
Who do we know in the FAA?
I don't know anyone. But Doyle does. I already got him on it.
I'll text you when I hear back from Doyle.
I gotta go.
You leaving?
Yeah. Thanks for last night.
  I had fun.   No, you didn't.
You were thinking of somebody else.
I got that one after ten years.
Hope it brings you some luck.
Elaine Brooks will be sponsoring
and the First Lady has approved the early draft.
Jackie, take a look at the board.
Get a sense of who might cosponsor, besides yourself.
Absolutely. I'm sure we can lock down a lot of heavyweights.
Lorrie and I will get right on it.
We should talk about a media plan.
  It's premature for that.   Don't we want to get this out,
start building support as soon as possible?
  Events, interviews?   I want what's most effective.
A media blitz is the wrong way to go.
You want a single long lead
that coincides with the introduction of the bill. Something classy.
  But you want broad support, to hit     A blanket strategy will
galvanize as many detractors as supporters.
Not if the message is framed in such way  
We want a key demographic to get on board, and then  
  Let me finish, please.   Then we let it percolate.
I suggest Matt Bai, The New York Times Magazine.
I like that idea. I like it very much.
So do I. Can you speak to Matt?
No promises. Just test the waters.
I'm happy to do that.
I've got a good relationship with Matt. I'll call him.
Great. Seth, you keep me posted,
and let's all get together later this week.
Thanks, Jackie.
I want you to read the bill and write me a summary.
Do not under any circumstances share it with anyone until we've spoken.
You don't want to go over the board first, at least   
No. Not yet.
Anything on the abortion?
Nothing. It all checks out.
  One hundred percent?   I turned over every stone.
  Mrs. Underwood was telling the truth.   We need something.
This is taking too long.
The Underwoods are careful.
If they have skeletons, they're buried deep.
Not a question of "If."
Somebody like Frank is gonna have skeletons.
Then I'll find them.
If you don't deliver, that means I don't deliver.
And I always deliver.
You gave me an assignment with high expectations.
I will meet them. But it's not gonna happen overnight.
So don't fuck with me.
I'm a hired gun. Not one that you own.
As long as you hit the target.
Then I need a favor.
Connor Ellis?
What about him?
I'll have more access if he isn't around.
Arrange a cushy job offer for him somewhere?
Private or public sector?
Private.
Lots of money.
Something he can't turn down.
I'll see what I can do.
Here, this is half.
You can pay me when I've gotten you what you want.
I don't take half pay for a job half done.
It's an interesting proposal.
What we're missing is a unified theme.
If we coordinate on national ad-buys, organize crossover events,
develop fund-raising apps, I think it would go a long way...
Maybe, but I doubt the leadership will go for it.
Which is why I'd like your support. I set up a meeting.
If you came, and you supported my position...
I just think they're gonna end up saying
we can't be thinning out our funds on a national strategy.
This is about fieldwork, getting out the vote.
Right, but isn't it worth at least some consideration?
Well, you know me, Linda, I mean, I'm all for bold ideas.
But Birch and Womack, why, they're... set in their ways.
I doubt very seriously that...
Listen, Frank, all I'm asking is that
you play devil's advocate with them.
Sorry, excuse me for a moment. This is important.
I don't want to short-shrift this, Frank.
No, I know, but I just have to send this text.
I am busy too.
  Make sure that's an aisle seat.   Of course.
I don't feel as if you're taking this very seriously.
Linda, I apologize. I am sorry.
You are absolutely right, I did not mean to sound curt.
And you are right, this is important.
You and I should go through your proposal
and discuss it right down to the last detail.
I am not asking you to go through it page by page,
just to help me initiate some meaningful dialogue.
  You can count on my help, Linda.   Thank you.
  I will have my scheduler reach out to yours.   Thank you, Linda.
Get me a secure line, please.
The vice president is on the line.
Mr. Vice President.
Normally, I would ignore your call, but I am in a good mood today.
Not even you could ruin it.
Are you funneling money to the Republicans?
What on earth are you talking about?
About  million in GOP Super PACs.
Now you know I never make political contributions.
That's the fastest way to upset my investors.
I know the money is coming from a casino in Missouri
and I know it's from Feng.
Mr. Feng and I have one co-venture together,
and it has nothing to do with gambling.
A plane that he owns flies to Lanagin's casino on a regular basis.
What he does on his own time is no business of mine.
Are you trying to create chaos in the ranks?
The Republicans appear to be doing a fine job of that without my help.
Well, it's not gonna work, Raymond.
It'll bind the democrats together, not pull us apart.
What has bound them together the past decade has been
the means to achieve a majority, if I had to guess...
He stacked Congress.
The majority I whipped.
So it's been you, Raymond, all along,
even when Lanagin's money was coming to us.
You keep making assumptions that I have denied.
Once the quarterly filings come out,
anybody with a laptop is gonna see what's going on.
The end of September.
That's a long way off. But I look forward to seeing the reports.
Should make for some very interesting reading
two weeks before the midterms.
You cannot bully your way back to the table, Raymond,
just as you cannot buy the keys to Congress.
Best of luck keeping your majority in the House.
I know how much it means to you.
When the money's coming your way, you don't ask any questions.
But now it's clear. Lanagin's never been anything but a front.
Do I tell the president? No.
He'll wonder why I didn't know,
which makes me look uninformed,
or he'll blame the messenger for involving him,
which makes me look careless.
I know it's a trap. I must keep this to myself.
He wants to know who you are buying on behalf of.
It's a hedge fund named Mercury Capital. It's unlisted.
They need the names of the principal investors.
Tell him I have to protect identities.
The broker needs more. He wants a full investor list.
Say, um...
Say that the principal investor has strong ties to the White House.
And they want to know if you represent Clayton West.
Clayton West?
  He's waiting.   One second.
What does it say?
It's about a refinery in China for rare earth elements.
Tell him yes. Tell him the principal investor is Raymond Tusk.
This is Doug Stamper...
  What should we serve the Walkers?   Cyanide.
Saving that for dessert. What about a main course?
Meat of some sort? Vegetables?
I mean, this isn't really my area of expertise.
I was thinking, what about Freddy?
  Ribs?   Or is that gauche?
No. I like the idea.
Well, we can do the nice china, gourmet sides,
but I think the ribs make it more personal.
I'll make the call.
  Any word on the call you're expecting?   Not yet.
I don't think he's landed.
This is really coming along, isn't it?
You think it's childish.
I think it's better than video games.
Do you have my check for  ,?
Next time when I get a raise.
Bad luck at the casino?
So Tusk knows I'm here.
  Daniel Lanagin knows you're here.   Is Tusk involved?
Why would I admit that?
Tusk is in business with you.
You're sending money to Lanagin.
Lanagin's casino is in Tusk's backyard.
You didn't fly halfway around the
world just to confirm suspicions.
Tell me what you want.
We want the money to stop flowing to the Republicans.
And what do I receive?
I've told you what we want. Now it's your turn.
Ah, so you can mislead me again.
Things have changed. We have nothing to gain by misleading you.
What do you think of my garden?
It's very beautiful.
When you only talk business, you stop appreciating beauty.
I don't have much time for beauty.
That's a shame.
For people like you to smell the flowers,
some of us have to pull the weeds.
  When do you plan on leaving?   I haven't bought my return ticket yet.
Good.
I'd like to think on this for a night.
And I'm sure you must be exhausted.
Would you do me the honor of being my guest?
  I'd be very grateful.   Excellent. You can get some rest.
And if you like,
there are many beautiful things to enjoy here.
Please.
Sir, Mr. Grayson is here.
Seth.
You and I haven't really properly had the chance to sit
and have a chat since you came on board.
Is there anything I can be doing better, sir?
No. No. I'm impressed.
You're very smart. Excellent work ethic.
But more importantly, you're very observant.
Information is power.
It was right here in this room that my wife revealed a great deal
of information to a great number of people. Millions of them.
Sir, if your concern is my knowledge of any discrepancies,
then let me assure you   
Claire and I are very private people.
I can understand why you might mistrust me.
I'm also observant, like you, Seth.
But I still have my blind spots.
It would have never occurred to me to reach out to Mrs. Marbury.
Her husband was dead. He kept no records.
And yet there it was, in black and white.
I respect the fact that you brought it to us.
That's what got you in the door.
But if you want to stay, I need more.
What exactly are you up to?
I was hired by Remy Danton.
He wants anything damaging that I can find.
  Does he have a copy of the journal?   No copies.
I gave the original to Mrs. Underwood,
and I told him that her story checks out.
  Did you give him anything else?   I don't have anything else.
I wouldn't give it to him if I did.
Why am I only hearing about this now?
Well, you're the vice president of the United States.
Remy works for Raymond Tusk.
That puts me between two extremely powerful people.
I had to be careful.
I'm sure that Remy's offering you a great deal of money.
But that's all he offers.
When I saw you push entitlement reform through the Senate,
it was clear to me where the real power in the White House is.
I want to work for a man like you, not sail a yacht.
Money doesn't interest me.
Do you want me to cease contact with Remy?
No. I want you to find the blind spots.
  Is he free?   For a few minutes.
  Thank you.   Mexico City,
where you'll meet president Soto.
We can practice your Spanish on the plane.
  What is that?   Frank gave it to me.
  Do you have a minute?   Yeah, is it important?
I have a meeting with... When is it?
He's already in the waiting room.
The archbishop of New York.
I'm just wondering if we should bring a gift to dinner tonight.
Yeah, well, it's casual. Maybe a bottle of wine?
You know them well.
Any idea what sort of wine they like?
Well, not extremely well,
but I'm friendly with their staff...
  I'll figure it out.   I can make a call.
I'm having a conversation with my husband, but thank you.
  OK. I apologize.   I'll see you at the residence.
Seven-thirty.
No.
Not now.
No. Just... Please go.
Get out. Please.
Rachel, it's me. I, uh...
you should answer when I call.
I don't like leaving messages.
Seth?
Ayla, I get  minutes to eat,
on a good day.
Xander Feng.
Means nothing to me.
Connor told me about a back channel with China.
There was speculation it was a guy named Xander Feng.
He's in business with Raymond Tusk.
They're working on a refinery in China.
Tusk has ties to the White House.
One of the wealthiest men in America
in business with an off-the-books chinese diplomat?
Influence in Washington never been reported?
The White House pushes rare earth subsidies
when the energy crisis spiked?
Do you have a specific question for me?
I'd like to ask the vice president about this.
A specific question for me,
not an interview request.
Does the vice president know Raymond Tusk?
Not to my knowledge.
You're hiding something, Seth.
I'm not hiding anything.
I'm just a guy with low blood sugar.
Garrett?
What is it?
Christina.
She won't leave me alone.
It's like she's trying too hard to be helpful.
I'll have Linda talk to her.
It's not just that.
I feel like it's a mask.
I feel like there's something else going on there.
Like what?
Sometimes, when I walk into your office
and see her talking to you...
...and you've been traveling together so much.
Jesus, Tricia.
Oh, not you, her.
I think she's attracted to you.
And she does have a history  
I can't even believe we're having this conversation.
I want you to relocate her.
  Find her another position   Absolutely not.
I know it seems overboard   She's a good aide.
She's valuable to Linda,
which makes her valuable to the administration.
I'm your wife.
I should be more valuable than either of them.
  Tricia.   I don't understand why you're fighting me on this
  when she bothers me   we're pulling up to Frank's in two minutes.
Really, superb, Freddy.
I can honestly say
I have never had better ribs in my life.
Well, I'm glad you liked you them.
You know, I read the article in the Sun
about how you go to Freddy's.
I hope you don't mind me speaking to that reporter, Frank.
Not at all.
Oh shit, I forgot I'm not supposed to call you that.
I wouldn't let you call me "Vice President" even if you tried.
And I didn't mind at all.
I thought the article was great.
Well, it's been a big bump in business since it came out.
I'm talking lines around the block.
You're not the only white person to show up there now.
Well, I'm gonna call it a night. I got a early start in the morning.
It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. President. Mrs. Walker.
A pleasure. Truly.
Thanks, Freddy.
Always.
No. None    none for me, thanks.
Mr. President, a slice of pie is good for the soul.
  I'm stuffed.   You can have a slice of pie.
I'm fine, really, but thank you, Frank.
I'll have some.
For the two of us, as well.
Now she is gonna make me run another five miles to work off this puppy.
Are you crazy? I can barely keep up with you.
  You're so much faster than me.   You two run together?
Yes. It's hard to find the time, but somehow we find it.
We do. And it's something that's just ours, you know?
Yes. Just ours. And about eight Secret Service agents.
That's so nice that you have that together.
I wish Garrett and I had more time for things like that.
We did take a spinning class together once.
You should have seen Garrett hunched over the handlebar   
Please.
Would you like some more wine?
I would, thank you. I saw the punching bag you gave him.
You know what? I will have a slice of pie.
Pie, please. For the president.
Thank you.
I read it front to back. I think it's good.
It'll cause a shit-storm, but maybe that's what we need.
Not during the midterms.
I don't see how we take flack.
We're trying to curtail rape, for godsakes.
Sure, some right-wingers will do their usual song and dance  
Hold off. I want to read it myself first.
We promised the Vice President we'd have cosponsors...
I know what we promised, and we're gonna stall.
  Don't disseminate the draft.   But you know the gist of the bill.
  I don't see why we can't     Lorrie.
All right, I'll leave it with you.
  Anything else?   No. I think we're good.
All right. Then I'm off.
Date night with the husband. Slit my wrists, please.
Go home at some point, OK?
The Capitol will still be here in the morning.
This is really something.
Ways to go yet.
Now, who won this battle? The North or the South?
Massive casualties on both sides. No clear winner.
How do you find the time?
I carve out a half hour here and there. Helps me relax.
I've forgotten the meaning of that word.
Well, that's what the punching bag is for.
It's very true.
Just a little. Tricia and I should get going soon.
You're never gonna make it through this first term, Mr. President.
How do you mean?
Well, not like this. Letting the stress creep in.
You need to run the marathon, not the sprint.
You need to enjoy these little moments of escape.
You can pour more than that.
Thank you.
  This Union or rebel?   Union, sir.
Enough "Sirs" and "Mr. Presidents." Call me by my name.
I respect the office too much for that.
When we're in private, it's OK.
Tonight, I don't have to be president.
I don't mean to get involved in your personal life.
Oh, no. I brought it up.
Is this really about Christina?
Or maybe it's just a symptom of something else?
  Like what?   I don't know.
I barely see him at all.
He's so wound up in everything that's going on overseas,
the elections, the economy.
When he was governor, it wasn't a cake walk,
but it was nothing like this.
How do you and Frank do it?
You both seem so close.
We're honest with each other.
We don't sweep anything under the rug.
Tricia, if it's eating at you, make him talk about it.
The White House is finite. Your marriage is for life.
  Good morning.   Morning.
You don't like your soup?
I'm not good with chopsticks.
I think you'll like this soup more than you liked the
two companions I sent you last night.
I was tired.
Have you had a chance to think about what we discussed yesterday?
In China, it's polite to refuse a gift the first time.
Maybe I should refuse yours.
We can't offer you a gift if I don't know what you want.
The Port Jefferson Bridge.
You pulled it, during the back-channel.
  I changed my mind.   Why?
I have allies who want the bridge.
Without it, they become my enemies.
  I've been put on trial twice.   Corruption charges.
Everyone in China who works on this level pays who they need to pay.
And they kill who they need to kill.
People disappear all the time, Mr. Stamper.
I could disappear. You could disappear.
Stop the junkets, and we'll get you the bridge.
The bridge comes first.
The vice president has lied to me before.
I need proof of his commitment. Then the money will stop.
Please, Mr. Stamper. Eat.
You have a long flight ahead of you.
If it's what you feel you need to do.
I've had a great experience here, Mrs. Underwood.
But this is an opportunity I can't pass up.
  I imagine the pay is substantial.   It is.
But it's not just that. There's room to grow at SpaceX.
Well, if your mind's made up, I won't try and convince you to stay.
The truth is... when I first came on board,
I thought it was to work for both you and your husband.
Don't get me wrong, it's been an honor working for you,
but I didn't foresee having to work with Seth.
  You're not very fond of each other.   No.
Which is fine. We're professionals.
But I think this is for the best.
Well, the problem with hiring great people
is everyone wants to steal them away.
I appreciate you being so understanding.
  You'll be missed, Connor.   Thank you.
Seth, it's me. He just left.
Talk to him and put out a press release.
Let's make this as smooth as possible.
It's two opportunities I'm interested in.
Family-oriented restaurant chain and a retail barbecue sauce.
What would that look like?
We give you an upfront payment for the right to use your brand.
Either venture fails, or they both do,
you still get to keep that money.
How much money we talking?
And then you'd have a share of the profits if we're successful.
What would the shares be?
I'll tell you what. Let me draw up papers.
You look them over. You show them to your lawyer.
I don't have a lawyer.
Well, you should get one.
I don't want you to feel like you're being cheated.
You're skeptical.
Look,
money usually don't come through that door
unless it's looking for a plate of ribs.
And we want to sell thousands of those plates.
Millions, if the franchise builds.
The Sun article put you on the map.
Let's fill up that map with Freddy's barbecue joints.
  What are you looking at?   Excuse me?
The knives are in the kitchen.
You have a pistol. You can stop staring.
Is he in here? Dan!
  How are you?   Good.
Care for a drink?
I'm good.
Well, let's, uh, go into the living room. It's more cozy.
Uh, I'm just fine where I am.
Well, all right. Uh, thank you.
Yes, sir.
I'm sure you've told Raymond that I've asked you here.
Raymond who?
Oh, you don't have to pretend, Dan.
Feng confirmed what you're up to.
Name doesn't ring a bell.
I have flight records.
One of his planes to Kansas City on multiple occasions.
Do we really have to play this game?
I came here because I thought you might have something to offer.
Why don't we just skip to that part.
You've been a loyal contributor, Dan.
You've thrown us fundraisers.
There are pictures of you and I shaking hands.
So whatever you've done this quarter
can be forgotten.
But I need the money to stop flowing in the wrong direction.
I'm still waiting for the offer.
You're a businessman, Dan,
  so I know your primary concern is profits.   Well, that's right.
But I'm offering you something that's far more valuable than money:
a direct line to the White House.
That sounds vague to me.
I have influence over the BIA.
Over federal gambling legislation.
The sort of influence that my contributions have already bought.
Not with my direct involvement and the president's ear.
You know what I like about money?
I can stack it on a table, like this one.
I can measure it with a yardstick.
I can see it, smell it,
buy things with it.
Houses, cars, clothes. Things that are real.
You're gonna have to show up with more than beads.
Dan, I invited you to my home because I thought   
Through the back door.
Excuse me?
Through the back door, like a servant.
The Secret Service makes everyone come in that way.
It's a precautionary meas  
Unless you're gonna offer me more money than Tusk   
and I don't think that you can   
there's little left for us to talk about.
I am offering you an alliance with a man
who goes to work every day at  Pennsylvania Avenue.,
I don't place my faith in any white man.
Especially one that works for the federal government.
I am just like you, Dan.
I know what it means to start from nothing,
to have to fight your way   
You know nothing about what it means to be me.
Your version of nothing was light years ahead of where I started.
I respect you, Dan. I take you serious  
I'll let you know when I give a fuck about your respect.
Holiday? Show Lanagin out.
I know where the back door is.
Francis?
It's not broken. I can fix it.
Leave it. I'll clean up later.
Let's go for a run. Burn off some of this steam.
Sir?
I'll be out in a moment.
I'll go ahead. You catch up.
Why didn't you reach out, before you got on a plane?
I was afraid our communication might be monitored.
Where are we with Lanagin?
Nowhere. Where are we with Feng?
We might have an option, but it's gonna be tricky.House.of.Cards.SE
Evelyn...
  Mr. Danton.   Remy.
  How are you?   I'm OK. I'm good.
  Been awhile.   Yeah, it has.
  Good morning.   Mr. Vice President.
Chief Whitehall.
Is Andrew Jackson going to be joining us?
No, I'm sorry, that's a terrible oversight.
Doug, will you... remove that.
Why don't we take the photograph first.
Thank you.
Please have a seat.
Let's talk federal recognition.
Your tribe has waited long enough.
  Who is it?   It's me. It's Lisa.
Can I come in?
Temp jobs, mostly.
Clerical work...
Right now I'm doing part-time at a dentist's office.
Reception.
You deserve better.
It is what it is.
This is the first time I've had Starbucks since I can remember.
It's a luxury for me these days.
Maybe there's something for you at Glendon Hill.
That's nice of you to say,
but I'm not the right fit for a place like that.
Sure you are.
Twenty years' experience in the non-profit sphere,
we coordinated all the time NGOs,
you'd be a valuable asset to us.
  Claire should've never let you go.   Yeah.
Well... I'll hold my tongue.
She and I don't talk.
We had a falling out.
  Loyalty isn't her thing.   No, it is not.
I don't think she's loyal to anyone.
  Except maybe her husband.   Maybe... maybe not.
What do you mean?
Nothing I know for certain, but...
...spend a decade working for someone...
She threaten you or anything?
No. She just wouldn't leave.
It's not like I wanted to call the cops.
She's not a bad person.
No, no, but...
I tried to talk to her. Then she lit up a pipe.
  Meth?   Yeah.
When we were roommates that's all it was.
I used to be really deep into that.
Heroin, too.
And then I found the fellowship.
What can I do?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't   
No, I'm glad you came here.
I know you're late for work.
I'll call in sick.
Don't do that. It's fine. I'll go.
Stay here.
I mean, don't go back there.
Are you sure?
Keys. In case you need to come and go.
I'll be back around :.
Thank you.
You don't have to thank me.
All the President has to do is pick up the phone,
and the bridge is approved.
If the President had wanted to be involved,
he would have already made that call.
It's his initiative, Linda.
Was his initiative. We're in a trade war now.
But that doesn't mean we have to abandon good policy.
It's inconsistent with his current stance.
The Committee on Foreign Investment has  days to approve.
There's only six days left.
They won't act without a directive from the
President of the United States.
I'm confused, you've been the biggest proponent
of a strong position against China.
That is not true.
I advocated the opposite early on.
You seem fixated on this bridge.
Is something else going on here?
Unemployment is at nine-point-two,
inflation is skyrocketing,
we're on the verge of losing our majority.
The president needs to offer a piece of good news.
A bridge? That's a drop in the bucket.
Jobs, infrastructure,
deficit reduction  
You're still not being straight with me.
I have no ulterior motive here,
but if you feel that strongly
and the president feels that strongly,
then I'll back off.
I won't mention it again.
I think that's a wise decision.
We should be a united front.
I couldn't agree more.
Thank you.
Why does everything have to be a struggle?
Can't some people just say "Yes" for once?
Sir.
I need the president's schedule for the next two days.
She change her mind?
What do you think?
So what's our next move?
I'll focus on the bridge,
you talk to the Indian affairs.
The sooner that Whitehall's tribe gets recognized,
the sooner they can break ground on that casino.
Yes sir.
Maybe it will help me, you know?
If I talk about it more in the open.
I mean that's what your interview did.
When I called. When I could say those things out loud.
Well, we don't want you to feel obligated.
I know the press hasn't left you alone.
If they're going to keep taking pictures of me,
I should at least say something.
Well, that's only going to become more intense
when McGinnis gets closer to his court-marshal.
Yeah, I know.
I'm prepared.
If you come and speak to the Armed Services Committee,
tell your story,
I feel confident we can get it to a vote.
I'd be too much coverage to ignore it.
And you think it will pass?
We need to get it through committee first.
But let's be clear, Megan,
it's not just the testimony.
We'll need you to do a media avail after.
Photo ops, a statement.
  Ok.   You won't be alone.
I'll be standing right next to you.
And so will I.
Ok.
Do you think we're doing the right thing?
Hauling her in front of the cameras?
We have to trust her when she says she wants to.
But it's very important
that the White House backs us up on this, not just you.
I'm not sure if Garrett will get involved publicly.
Well, can you talk to him?
We haven't been doing much talking about anything lately.
Things haven't gotten any better?
We haven't said a word to each other in almost a week.
I've been there, it's awful.
With Frank?
Sure.
What did you do?
We saw someone.
You mean a therapist?
Weren't you worried about exposure?
He was a minister.
He wasn't exactly a therapist.
It was more like a spiritual guidance, type thing.
The only difference was that he had a degree.
I could put you in touch.
It's too risky.
Just a suggestion.
Let me know if you change your mind.
Thanks.
In the meantime, can you try to talk to Garrett?
We really need his support with this.
I will.
Yes?
Show him in, please.
Remy.
So formal.
Would you have a seat?
Shouldn't keep your interns so late.
You and I might not have lives, but they do.
When there's work to be done, we work. They know that.
Why am I here at  at night?
Where is the GOP getting their money?
That is a   million question, isn't it?
You must have an idea.
What makes you think that?
Because you know things.
That's why Glendon Hill made you partner.
Most of our clients are Democrats.
I'm just as much in the dark as you are.
I'm losing in my district, Remy.
And I wish I could help you.
Even if I pull off a win, it doesn't matter.
The GOP takes the House,
I lose my spot in the leadership,
this office, everything I've worked for.
I feel for you.
But you want information I don't have.
Are you upset
about the last time we saw each other?
Not at all.
I made myself clear.
Can we talk?
No work, no politics.
We can talk about whatever you want.
I've never... been with anyone for more than six months.
When I was in the army I was always on the move and, um...
Since I've been in Congress,
I just haven't had time.
I wasn't asking to marry you.
Just to be more than company for a night.
Do you still want that?
I'm here, aren't I?
There would have to be clear boundaries.
Whatever we have privately
couldn't affect our professional relationship.
Then we shouldn't be having this conversation in your office.
I'm glad we had this meeting.
If you'd like to have another, just call me.
We can leave the secretaries out of it.
I'll review this and have Linda get in touch.
  Thank you, sir.   Thank you, sir.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Hi, Frank.
I left my bourbon at home,
but you have time for some coffee?
I'm fine, you go ahead.
I wanted to talk to you about the Port Jefferson Bridge.
Linda told me you two spoke.
Have you reconsidered?
It's not the right time, Frank.
We'll find some other project
to showcase our program once tensions subside.
During the campaign,
you repeatedly promised to address critical infrastructure.
We're well into your second year.
This project is ready to go,
you don't want to have to start from square one.
I'm thinking midterms.
We have to project consistency.
Except people don't vote for consistency,
they vote for concrete progress.
Linda mentioned that you seemed obsessed with this bridge.
I'm beginning to think she was right.
The backstabbing, vomit-inducing bitch.
Is she right, Frank?
Tell me why this bridge is so important to you.
I wanted to insulate you from this  
From what?
You asked me to back channel with the Chinese
and I have continued to do so.
No, I told you to stop back channeling
and you did anyway?
Without informing me, Frank  
I needed to distance you.
There are issues that a president cannot be aware of.
What issues  
But, what I can tell you...
...is that the building of this bridge
directly affects our ability to combat the Republicans
in the midterms.
Have the Chinese  
Mr. President, you are asking questions
you do not want the answers to.
All right, how much danger are we in, Frank?
None if we end this conversation right now.
Sometimes I feel like
I'm losing control over my goddamn administration.
You're under pressure, sir,
but you're not losing control.

me, Linda, your wife.
I might be losing control of her too.
I shouldn't have said that...
Of course she wants the best for me.
Has Claire said anything?
I know they talk.
Not much...
just that things have been a little rocky.
Well, that's an understatement.
You have the most difficult job on earth.
It would take a toll on any marriage.
Which is why I'm urging you
to reconsider your decision on the bridge.
And I'd say that not as your vice president...
but as your friend.
Because I care about you.
All right, I'll... I'll have another look at it.
Thank you, Mr  
Thank you, Garrett.
Mr. Frost.
Morning.
We filed all our paperwork back in .
We dotted all of our I's and crossed all of our T's.
There's over  applications.
Each one requires at least a year to review.
  You need more researchers.   It's not just personnel.
There's travel, filing, administration...
Name the figure.
Twelve, thirteen million.
That requires an appropriation from Congress.
The vice president can make that happen.
But first we need you to recognize the Ugaya tribe.
Our policy is first come, first serve.
There are other applications which we  
Daniel Lanagin disenrolled us.
We lost our right to BIA benefits.
Is this more about starting a casino?
It's about correcting an injustice.
I can't be getting involved in inner-tribal conflicts.
Yes, you can.
If you want that appropriation.
Two months.
Maybe less if all the ancestry holds up.
Lanagin knows.
And what did he say?
He wants to meet.
But on his turf this time.
I need a way to get to Missouri
without attracting any attention.
Womack's district's in Kansas City.
It's not far from the casino.
See if he has any events coming up.
Rallies, fundraisers.
How's it coming with co-sponsors for Claire's bill?
Terrific. We're making great progress.
One speech. It'll send a message to Congress that   
And a message to the Joint Chiefs that I'm trampling on  
Twenty-four thousand assaults last year,
only , reported because  
I know the figures.
Do you know how many suicides result from the trauma  
It's not the question of statistics.
This bill will save lives.
Can we discuss this later?
I had to schedule this meeting, Garrett.
It's the middle of the day, Tricia.
You know very well...
Don't make me lobby you when I go home  
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. President.
The secretary general's here.
I got two more minutes.
It's :. He was scheduled for :.
I'll go.
You were supposed to tell me to stay,
but it's nice to know I'm worth at least two minutes.
Hi, Tricia.
No, please, don't worry about it.
Oh, that's awful.
Yes, of course.
Let me grab his number for you.
Right.
His name is Dr. Thomas Larkin,
at   .
And if you'd like, I can give him a call beforehand
and let him know you'll be reaching out.
Okay. Well you let me know if I can be of any help.
Good night, Tricia.
What do you think?
We'll see.
The idea is to take color theory
and turn it on its head.
Break all the rules.
They're gorgeous.
Who'd you say your client is?
I didn't.
I was just wondering if maybe I knew them.
You don't.
Let's say he's a collector
always on the lookout for new talent.
I understand you work for Adam Galloway.
Yeah...
it's a way to pay the bills.
I mean, Adam's a good photographer
if you like that kind of thing.
I'm much more interested in form.
How much for all of them?
What?
I'd like to buy them all.
Missouri is the Show Me State for a reason.
And we need to show the rest of America
that we can keep our leadership intact.
It is a pleasure to look out
and see a room full of smiling faces.
That's not something you see every day in Washington, D.C.
What did your editors say?
This should be twice that.
I can probably get them to eight,
but I'm gonna need the first lady, too.
Separate interviews.
Let me talk to Mrs. Underwood.
How come you're coming to me with this instead of Connor?
Between you and me, he's out.
He got a job at SpaceX.
His choice or was he pushed out?
People don't like working with me, Matt.
You may be the only one.
I don't like you either.
I might if you give me the First Lady.
They'll both be speaking to armed services tomorrow.
Along with Megan Hennessy.
She's the one the general  
That's right.
I'll set up a one-on-one, text you for your piece.
All right, let me know, man.
Anything for the Times, man.
Anything for the Times, huh?
Then we get shut out of donor meetings.
The magazine. And yes.
Raymond Tusk.
Your boss went to see him last October.
It's in his congressional travel report.
Before my time.
You said they didn't communicate.
I said, "Not to my knowledge."
We're in Missouri.
He's not one of the donors.
I can quote you on that?
If you spell my name right.
Now, normally, I don't quote Northern writers,
but every now and then one of them
says something that makes a lot of sense,
and this Emerson fellow you probably heard of,
once wrote that the only way
to have a friend is to be one.
I think you all know
what kind of a friend Terry has been to this district.
So I am proud to introduce him today
and to call him my friend.
Would you please welcome, the majority leader,
Representative Terry Womack.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
We all set?
I told the press
you were having some private meetings with contributors.
Any protests?
We're good except for Ayala Sayyad.
  Thank you.   Thank you. What's going on?
Potential blind spot.
Tell me on the way to the car.
Mr. Vice President.
Thank you.
Calm down. Now.
Welcome.
What a pleasant surprise, Raymond.
Mr. Vice President.
I was expecting to see you privately today, Daniel.
It's a serious matter.
I invite all the chiefs to the circle.
Nice pool.
I've never swum in it.
The chlorine hurts my eyes.
You're welcome to take a dip in it if you'd like.
Another time.
Well, Raymond tells me you're a ribs man.
Well, I've got three of the choicest pieces of meat
you'll ever see in your life coming out.
You do not want to pass on this.
I won't be here long.
So, the Ugaya band.
Tip of the iceberg.
They're not a real tribe.
They're about to be.
No, they're a bunch of troublemakers
with too much hope on their hands.
Once they get recognized,
they're gonna have their own casino.
In two years... at best?
You better enjoy this pool while you can.
I don't think your casino
can stand that sort of competition.
Who do you think Whitehall called
as soon as he left the BIA?
You offer them a casino two years from now,
we offered what they really want.
Reenrollment in my tribe.
A tip of your iceberg is melting, Frank.
And you do not have time on your side,
so how about this...?
You help me repair my relationship with Garrett,
Dan and I here get the money
flowing back in the right direction.
How about this...?
I get the BIA to investigate both of you.
Connection to Feng, laundering  
You could, but you won't.
You don't dare.
My money has been going to the Democrats for nine years.
You were the whip for all of them.
You implicate us, you implicate yourself.
And everyone in the leadership.
Here comes the steak.
Now you are going to enjoy this, Frank.
There you go.
Thank you.
Now dig in, Frank.
Before the flies get to it.
I'll pass, thanks.
Are you sure?
This is soy-fed Matsusaka beef.
You know, my ancestors would've prayed to this heifer
to honor her spirit.
But at  bucks a pound,
I figure... fuck tradition.
Come on, live a little, Frank.
Mr. Vice President.
Not my Vice President.
You're on sovereign land.
Dogs are so predictable, aren't they?
Set up a meeting with Walker.
Tonight, if possible. I should be back by six.
Lanagin didn't budge?
He reenrolled the Ugaya. We have to get the bridge approved now.
I'll call Linda.
Bypass her, I don't want her in the meeting.
I'm on it.
Thanks.
Meechum, get in touch with the plane
have them make ribs for the flight back.
Yes sir.
Mr. Vice President, do you have a moment?
I'm sorry, the President asked to see me.
No, he didn't, you requested the meeting
and I took it off the schedule.
You did what?
Let's go in your office.
You lied, Frank.
You said you would let the bridge go
and then you went behind my back,
just like you're trying to do now.
I do not require your permission.
No, but you should involve me.
The President and the Vice President
have issues they must discuss privately.
When you are secretive,
it prevents me from being able to do my job.
And when you cancel meetings,
it prevents me from being able to do mine.
Which is why I wanted to talk,
so we can work things out.
  I will not waste my time   We should be working together.
inflating your sense of self-importance!
Excuse me?
How many elections have you won?!
How many congressional committees have you chaired?!
Would you even be working in the White House
if I hadn't recommended you during the campaign?
I returned that favor and then some.
Look where your desk is now!
And I'd say we're even.
And if you want to maintain my respect,
you're going about it all wrong.
I asked you in here to work out a situation  
You didn't ask, you demanded!
I will not be left out of the loop,
I'm the president's chief of staff.
You call this being chief of staff?
Micromanaging his datebook?
I'd say that's more of a glorified scheduler.
The White House would fall off its rails without me doing my job.
  Are you certain about that?   Yes, I am.
I look out for the president  .
I keep him informed.
I keep his priorities straight.
We did just fine before you became vice president, Frank.
All right, let's go over to the Oval Office right now

his chief of staff or his vice president.
I know what the answer would be.
You wanna go?
I didn't think so.
Now I will see the president tomorrow morning,
schedule or no.
And please, turn out the lights before you leave.
I thought you went home.
No, not yet.
Um, do you have a moment?
Is there something wrong?
I know you are reconsidering the bridge project and I want 
I'm reviewing it. I'll make my decision soon.
But you already made a decision, sir.
I'm concerned that you are overthinking this one.
  If we backtrack...   Did I not make myself clear?
I'm just trying to offer my advice, sir.
Which I've heard.
And which I don't need to hear again
but... thank you.
I know the vice president spoke to you yesterday
  and in fairness...   You know I value your input, linda,
but when I say I've heard it,
you need to know I mean that.
Of course, sir.
Is there anything else?
No, sir.
  Good night.   Good night.
You disappointed me.
I told you it would take time.
Any leads?
I've been going over his state senate days.
It's a slow process.
I have to be thorough.
So how is it that i've found more in two days
than you have in two months?
What do you mean?
I've had to do your job for you.
You found something?
I'm the one who's supposed to ask that question.
What'd you find?
Maybe I can help.
Are you working for Frank?
Yeah, as his communications director.
No, are you working for him?
Come on.
He couldn't pay me a fraction of what you're offering.
Don't lie to me.
Look, if you've lost confidence in my ability  
Stop fucking around.
You made the wrong choice, Seth.
I don't think so.
You're nothing.
You're a parasite.
So are you Danton.
Just in a nicer suit.
Do you know what it might be?
Well, keep your ear to the ground.
That was Seth.
He thinks Remy may have something on us.
What?
He doesn't know.
  Do you think it could be     No.
If it's anything I'm sure it's innocuous.
Nothing we can't weather.
But my bet is they're bluffing.
Just to make us paranoid.
But he's a dangerous man, isn't he? Raymond?
We can be dangerous too.
When we need to be.
 Lord, I just can't 
 keep from crying sometimes. 
 Lord, I just can't 
 keep from crying sometimes. 
 When the world's filled with sorrow 
 and my eyes are filled with tears. 
 Lord, I just can't 
 keep from crying sometimes. 
Don't stop.
I used to be a call girl.
I had to get away from it.
And that's why I came here.
There's a lot of stuff you don't know about me.
You don't have to say anything you don't want to.
When you tapped on my shoulder on the bus,
there was something...
Your eyes.
  That sounds really, really dumb.   No.
Um, I don't know.
I felt like I wanted to tell you everything.
Like, that I could trust you,
  even though I didn't know you.   You can.
I never trusted anyone.
Have you ever loved anyone?
No.
I've never expected much from the world.
It's ugly.
It's not a fair place.
I'm happy to have what I have.
I'm glad I have this.
I've thought it all out.
And there's a way to do it
so we don't risk any exposure.
Do we have to talk about this now?
I'm beat.
My brain is f...
Yes, we do.
Because it's our marriage.
If we're going to survive the next two years...
or six.
We need to do something.
We should be each others' support system.
Not cause each other stress.
The foundation of this White House is not brick and mortar.
It's us, Garrett.
This is important to me.
And I want it to be important to you.
I have to trust that whatever you're managing,
to whatever extent you choose not to inform me,
that I'm neither at risk,
nor passively condoning something blatantly illegal.
Any risk solely falls on me,
and you can't be accused of condoning what you're not aware of.
Being not aware is just as egregious.
Not in this case.
I'm steering the ship away from the rocks,
not toward them.
Then I'll call the committee for foreign investments.
You're making the right decision, sir.
I have another difficult decision to make.
Linda submitted her resignation.
I was furious with her.
That was a very manipulative move.
I can speculate as to why she made it.
Are her complaints valid?
I have a very biased view on that subject.
Well, I've heard hers.
Give me yours.
Linda and I don't always agree.
But she's been very loyal to you,
and a more than competent Chief of Staff.
So you think I should keep her?
Do I think she oversteps sometimes?
Yes.
Does she wrongly equate her advice with mine?
Often. But...
the question that occurs to me is not about Linda.
Let's say you refuse her resignation,
if this gets out, and it could,
won't you be sending a signal to anybody who works for you that...
...you can be leveraged.
She offered her resignation.
She's already gone even if she stays.
Megan. They're ready.
I don't know, my hands are shaking.
You can do this, Megan.
I'll be there.
I get panic attacks sometimes.
  You're afraid you'll get one?   Yeah.
OK, why don't we ask for a couple more minutes,
  that's not a problem.   It's not about that,
they just come.
I can't control them.
I don't want to do this.
OK, Megan, there's some of the most senior congressmen
and women in the room,
and the press, they've shown up just to hear from you.
I know.
OK, I don't want to pressure you,
but a lot of planning has gone into this.
Please don't make me do this.
We're not making you do anything.
Then can I just go back home?
  Back to Chicago?   Listen, you have nerves,
that's understandable.
I don't wanna fucking do it, OK?
I understand, it's OK.
But if you back out now, Megan...
This isn't about me at all, is it?
...this is not good for us. It hurts us,
it makes us look unorganized.
This is about your fucking moment to shine.
You don't fucking care if do...
I do care. I do care.
It is about me and about you!
And for whatever reason,
we both decided to share what happened to us.
And it mattered and people listened
so let's go in and finish what we started.
I can't, I'm not the right person.
Come on, Megan.
You know what I did last night?
I picked up some guy at a bar.
A total stranger.
I let him fuck my brains out at the hotel.
Night before, same thing.
I can't stop.
It's my only way to fucking...
Jesus, I fucking hate this
when my hands shake like this and I...
It's OK.
  It's OK.   I'm not who you want to be your poster girl.
You don't have to be. You don't have to be.
I'm sorry I'm letting you down.
It's OK, you're not letting me down.
It's OK. It's OK.
When will it become official?
President will make his call this afternoon.
Official approval will be announced in the morning.
No revisions to the agreement?
None. Everything is as spelled out in the proposal.
Then I will uphold my end of the bargain.
The money will be cut off.
You required proof. Now we want some.
What sort?
Of your commitment.
You kill your co-venture with Tusk.
That was never part of the deal.
It is now.
The refinery can't proceed while we're in a trade war.
We want you to kill it for good.
And we want you to kill it today.
Make the call to Tusk.
It's business hours. Is this a business call?
No...
I was hoping it wasn't.
What are you doing tonight?
Just about to get on a plane.
Where to?
Boundaries, remember?
Work related.
I don't take vacation.
Can you tell me when you'll be back?
Tomorrow. It's a quick trip.
Do you want to have dinner?
I'd like that.
Bring your carry-on.
You can stay over after.
Yes.
Do you have a moment?
Absolutely.
The president accepted my resignation an hour ago.
Yes, I know.
I almost told him that I changed my mind,
but I realized it wouldn't make any difference.
For whatever it's worth,
I did bring up your loyalty
and how good you are at your job.
Not that he needed me to remind him.
And I will always be grateful you recommended me.
It has been quite a ride.
Shorter than I would've hoped,
but I have a long career ahead.
No doubt.
And just so you know,
I don't plan on making any fuss in the press.
You'll hear nothing but my praises if I'm asked.
I have something for you.
A few weeks ago,
the president told me about a dinner he had at your house.
He went on and on about your Civil War models.
How much fun he had painting the toy soldiers with you.
This was given to me by the director of the Smithsonian.,
It's the first Medal of Honor awarded to a Hispanic-American.
Corporal Joseph De Castro.
He fought for the Union.
Linda, I don't know what to say.
It's clear the president sees you as a friend.
I've never been that to him.
But his job is bigger than friendship.
It's bigger than you and me.
I just hope you'll look out for him the way I've tried to do.
I will.
And I'll treasure this.
Goodbye, Mr. Vice President.
I've never thought higher of her than I do at this moment.
She lost, but she played to win.
Underwood got to Feng.
The refinery's dead.
Grayson played us.
We're running outta options.
What do you think, Jean?
Fuck him.
Do it.
Thank you.
Thank you for doing this, Sandra.
Richard.
How are you, Richard?
He has his good days and his bad.
This is a good day.
He'd love to spend a few minutes with you after your meeting.
Of course.
The reverend's in here.
Mrs. Walker.
Hello.
Mr. President.
Reverend.
How can I help?
You need to get a fan in here, Francis.
Well, the AC is all the way up to full blast.
I mean from the fumes, the glue.
Oh, that's half the fun.
Megan Hennessy bailed on us today.
Why?
Her nerves got to her.
And she decided she didn't want to be in the public eye.
Well, we can sympathize with that.
That was Doug.
Yes.
Seth.
I'll call you back.
When?House.of.Cards.SE
  Hey, Freddy! How ya doing?   Hey.
All right, that's what I like to hear.
  My man.   Catch you later, brother.
I spoke to everyone I know at the Daily.
Nobody's naming sources, but it has to be Remy.
Is Galloway going on the record?
He wouldn't. Not without speaking to us first.
  Let's be sure about that.   I'll talk to Adam.
Maybe it's smarter to avoid contact.
Somebody has to respond,
whether it's him, or us, or both.
We have to coordinate, and do it carefully.
Let me take care of this.
Well, let's just think this through.
I've got it covered, Francis.
Ok.
What should I do? Head back to the office?
I think you should work here.
We can't avoid the press if you leave.
  All right. You hold down the fort.   Yes, sir.
And you follow Claire's lead.
We'll shut this down, sir.
There can't be any doubt.
Let's walk through a timeline.
  So you first met him when?  In Whitney Biennial...
This hurts us both.
But it's not my wound to suture.
Claire must be the surgeon.
Only she can stop the bleeding.
You know we got them plates in there.
All the changes you asked for.
Gave you five more points on the post-recoupment share.
Approval over all the marketing materials.
Approval over the staff hires of the flagship in Silver Spring.
  So, what next?   You sign.
  And I get my  ,?   By the end of the week.
Just have to wire it from our main account into the LLC,
had cash years to check for.
I want to show you this.
It's a mockup of the bottle design.
And we already started on the concept layouts
for the Silver Spring location.
Why's that linoleum peeling up?
To make it seem real.
I wanted it to look nicer than this.
We can scratch the peeling linoleum,
but we don't want it to look too nice.
You want them white folks to feel like they slummin' it.
No, to have an authentic atmosphere.
And I get to play the nigger.
Look, Freddy, you know how this works.
They don't just want the ribs,
they want the experience,
but without having to leave the suburbs for it.
We're not selling candlelit dinners here.
But I promise,
nothing gets built without your signing off.
So, what do you want me to do?
  I need you to deny it.   The affair?
The affair, taking the photograph, everything.
We have a public history.
I donated work for your...
You can say we had a business relationship,
but that you didn't take the picture of me in the bed.
It was Photoshopped.
Whatever it is you need to say.
I'm so sorry, Claire.
I only have one print and it's still here.
You have to destroy it.
The digital file also.
But e-mail us a copy first.
Why?
We need to make sure that there's nothing in the image
that links to your studio.
Whatever you think is best.
Thank you, Adam.
I watched you...
...when you did the CNN interview.
I promised myself I wouldn't, but I couldn't help it.
It's a shame it takes this for us to talk to one another.
You're well, besides this?
Yeah. I spent three months in Colombia
after you came up here to work,
but also to get away.
I met someone.
She's from Bogot.
She was working with an NGO there.
Her name's Inez.
She's living with me now.
That...
Things happened quickly.
Yeah. They did.
I should go.
So I won't talk to the press until I get instructions.
That's right.
It's good to hear your voice.
You too.
  You finished?   Yeah.
Crazy, right?
Smack, crack, blow.
No, thanks.
Come on, old man. We got what you need.
I don't need anything.
Gotta buy somethin' if you want to get inside.
Get out the way.
What?
For real.
You need to get the fuck on outta my way.
Just fucking with you, nigger.
Chill the fuck out.
Who are you?
Your grandfather. Open up.
What's your plan?
Work from home.
You don't need me dragging this circus to the White House.
I mean in terms of a statement.
We're drafting one, short and sweet.
Forgive me, Frank, but you know I have to ask.
If it were true, I would tell you, sir.
Would you like me to go on record?
Say I stand beside  
No, no, no. I appreciate that, Mr. President,
but you shouldn't dirty your hands with this sort of garbage.
If the press corners you,
just tell them you don't engage in gossip mongering.
Sir, it seems Mr. Galloway is about to appear on television.
Go. Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Thank you, sir.
Good afternoon.
I have very little to say.
Only that I never had any romantic involvement with Claire Underwood,
and that I did not take the photograph printed in the DC Daily.
I'm sorry that the vice president and his wife
have to go through this ridiculous ordeal.
And I would ask that the media leave both my fiance and me out of it.
Thank you.
You'll be ready in an hour?
Yes. We'll be ready.
You might want to change into something more...
  Conservative?   Yes.
I'm gonna go throw the hounds a bone.
I know it's demeaning   
Not another word.
I should have been more careful.
We'll put this behind us, just like we've always done.
Part of me wishes...
What?
That you'd be more upset.
Tusk came after you because of me.
It's you who should be upset.
Wasted energy, isn't it?
For both of us.
Shall we rehearse?
I don't need your help.
This ain't a handout.
You have to pay me back over time. Work for it.
Work for you?
I'm gonna get the house either way.
Whether you choose to live in it is up to you.
Yeah, just what I need.
You in the easy chair,
laying into me every time I come in and out the door.
The place is for you and DeShawn.
I'm gonna be at my own apartment.
You sure this nigga ain't just sellin' you smoke?
Says it right in the contract,  Gs no matter what.
I don't know, man.
Five years I don't see you,
then you come knocking on the door, talking about you got  Gs  
Your choice.
You didn't want me to visit you no more in jail
and you sure didn't want to see me after you got out   
I still don't want to see you.
Well, here I am.
Get the fuck outta here, old man.
You listen to me, boy.
I never had nothing to give you.
I didn't have no money, and you didn't want whatever I had.
But we talking about a house.
DeShawn deserves to live better
  than in a place like this.   This ain't about him.
It's about you.
You know where to find me.
See you, kid.
Less than  minutes.
Are they going to deny?
I'm gonna let the Vice President and his wife speak for themselves.
Have they been in contact with Mr. Galloway?
No, they haven't.
Why has it taken them a full day to respond.
I'm sure you can understand that
they wanted to consult with legal counsel first
regarding defamation and slander.
You're saying they will deny the affair.
I'm saying they'll be out here in  minutes
and you can quote them instead of me.
Thank you all very much for your patience.
I hate this.
What, waiting?
No, the affair. It's bullshit.
I feel like a tabloid hack.
You'd rather be stuck at the White House all day?
Fuck this.
Where are you going?
To do something meaningful with my time.
Hey, I need you to book me a flight to St. Louis.
Tonight, if you can find something.
No Q A, so don't even try.
Behave yourselves, people.
I find it very painful
that anyone would suggest
I'm capable of being unfaithful to my husband,
whom I love dearly.
I've known Adam Galloway for years.
We both have.
When I ran the Clean Water Initiative,
I commissioned him to do a series of photographs
for the marketing campaign.
And he was extremely generous by donating work
for our fund-raising auctions.
So I'm not sure why he would deny taking the photograph.
I love Adam's work, so I asked him to take this portrait.
We did it here, at the house.
Francis was there during the shoot.
It was a birthday present.
Claire asked me what sort of portrait I wanted,
and I said I want one of her sleeping,
because she's so very beautiful when she's sleeping.
It hangs in my office on the second floor.
They're fucking lying.
So I can only assume
that Adam was intimidated by the media attention,
and he needed to distance himself.
What?
But really, all we have here
is a very talented photographer
and a prized possession.
Thank you all very much.
Thank you.
Because it would've seemed too clean otherwise, like we were  
You made me look like an idiot.
If we had the same story,
the media would assume we were coordinating.
It needed to look messier.
This was supposed to go away, Claire.
I've got twice as much press outside the building now.
Adam...
I've gotta keep the lights off
'cause they're on the roof across the street, trying to film us inside.
You just need to confirm that you took the photo for us.
Confirm our version.
Say you lied because you were scared.
I don't know why you didn't just tell me
this is what you were intending to do.
Because I know you, and you would've refused.
You have too much pride.
I don't want to speak to the press again.
Listen.
If you say nothing,
they're not going to leave you alone.
They will just camp out for weeks on end  
This is... it feels wrong, Claire.
It feels...
I'm sorry I lied.
I wasn't trying to be manipulative  
I have to go.
Adam?
Adam?
I think he'll do the right thing.
I don't know. I hope so.
Cigarette?
No. I'm gonna turn in.
Wake me if he goes on TV.
  Sir.   Doug,
why don't you and Seth come over?
Yes, sir.
Should we consider a lawsuit against the paper?
Show we won't tolerate this sort of gossip?
They won't settle.
They'll fight it in the courts because it'll generate more news.
And what about the president?
He offered to say something.
Draws more attention.
President isn't a bad idea,
if we phrase a statement for him.
He becomes the headline
and we can't control his press operation.
But if we coordinate with them, it shouldn't   
Coordination looks bad.
So it's your job to conceal it.
If Seth doesn't think the president should make a comment,
then we should defer to his judgment.
I'm gonna go get another beer.
  I can go grab you one, sir.   No. I feel like stretching my legs.
Doug, diet Coke?
I'm fine, thank you, sir.
Seth, a beer?
I have to drive, but thanks.
I'll be right back.
Watch yourself.
What do you mean?
Connor was an easy target,
but I'm not going anywhere.
Look, doug, I'm grateful just to be here.
You think I've survived with the vice president
so long by being blind?
Upward mobility has a ceiling with the Underwoods.
I'm the ceiling.
Understood.
What else have you got on them?
Nothing.
You fork over the journal without a backup plan for a rainy day?
I don't think so.
I had one hand and I played it.
I don't press my luck.
You can't expect me to believe you.
I don't.
I wouldn't if I were you.
But I'm telling the truth.
A little sibling rivalry isn't such a bad thing,
especially between adopted boys.
They either push each other
to be the best versions of themselves,
or one of them gets booted back to the orphanage.
You're in my house. You drink if I drink.
One Diet Coke for you, and one beer for you.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, darling, what a mess.
Sweetheart.
How are you holding up?
The press have been harassing us the past two days.
we barely made it out of the building without being trampled.
Oh, how awful.
You said someone was here to see me?
He's in my office.
Did he tell you who he was?
I didn't want to say over the phone.
You never know, these days.
He says he used to work for the Underwoods.
  Who?   Your assistant.
  No, she would never     She would and she did.
Why are you doing this?
  Not me. The man I work for.   And who is that?
That doesn't concern you.
This is my life you're fucking with.
You and I are just pawns, Mr. Galloway.
You should leave.
We need more...
...to prove the affair happened. Another photograph.
Thirty seconds, you better be out the door.
I'm not going anywhere.
You recognize the country code?
And the city code is Bogot.
Is it still ringing?
Marshall!
Hey, pops.
Man, never seen it like this before.
The line's down the block.
Something else, ain't it?
Looks like you could use some help.
Got a extra apron in the back.
Let's go!
She refuses to leave the lobby.
What's her name?
Ayla Sayyad, Wall Street Telegraph.
She's part of the Vice President's press corps.
Oh, yeah.
Send her up.
I appreciate it, tricia, but I'm fine.
This whole thing will blow over in a day or so,
and I'll...
Can you hold on one second?
The Daily. They called for a comment.
Did Adam speak with them?
Yes, but not what we told him to say.
He sent them this.
Tricia, can I call you back?
  Is that you?   No.
Because he's saying it is.
  It might be.   Mrs. Underwood.
I mean, it could be, yes.
It probably is.
I asked you about any vulnerabilities.
I didn't know he took this.
You have short hair in the picture.
You said it ended over two years ago.
Well, I visited him last fall.
Does anyone else know? Did anyone see you there?
He had friends over, to his apartment.
Christ.
But we've said that he's a friend.
There's nothing wrong with me visiting him, being at a party.
There is if this photo is on the front page of the Daily.
Politics and business are intertwined in China,
as I'm sure you know.
It's not uncommon to partner
with someone who can ensure Beijing's approval.
So you needed his political influence.
All this is moot. Our venture fell through.
Right after the Port Jefferson Bridge was approved.
I had nothing to do with that project.
Neither did Feng, to my knowledge.
No, but Wu Bin Yang did.
He's Feng's biggest rival in Beijing.
It looks like I shouldn't be schooling you on Chinese politics.
You know far more than I.
You used the word "Intertwined."
That's the sense I'm getting from all of this.
The samarium subsidy, the Chinese refinery, the bridge,
your friendship with the President...
Who sent you?
Who sent me?
When you're as rich as I am,
you're always a target.
Nobody sent me.
You're here...
in St. Louis.
Instead of covering the vice president and his wife.
My gut says there's more to Xander Feng than has been reported.
  Yeah.   It's a far better use of my time
than reporting on tabloid sex scandals.
It's not real news.
You miss Tehran.
I read some of your work while you were in the waiting area.
  It started to get too dangerous.   Yeah.
Not the best place to be
when you want to get married and start a family.
Or if you're Jewish.
That, too.
My wife got this for me when she visited there,
before the revolution.
It's beautiful.
It, um, broke when it was being shipped,
into a thousand pieces.
It took specialists over a year to restore it.
Here, I want you to have it.
I can't accept gifts.
No, no. Not as a gift.
No. As a reminder of how hard it can be to
put something back together again once it's been crushed.
If you're going to threaten me,
you don't have to go to the trouble of veiling it.
I don't usually do interviews with reporters.
They're parasites.
Usually interested in just finding a way to knock me down a peg.
Invariably,
what they write is inaccurate.
And when that happens,
I have no choice but to retaliate.
America can be just as dangerous as Iran, ms. Sayyad.
Thank you for your time, mr. Tusk.
Travel safe back to Washington.
Get Remy on the line.
Remy's on line two.
Remy.
Let's not hold back on the other thing.
Hit 'em again, and hit 'em now.
Best day yet.
You gotta get a safe or something.
Or maybe one of those, uh, pickup services.
That's too much money to be carrying around at night.
I can handle myself.
There ain't nobody can handle a Glock to the face.
Unless you got one yourself.
My days of packin' are long gone.
There.
Take mine.
I got one at home.
What the fuck you doin' bringin' that thing in here?
Oh, it's just for protection, man.
I don't know what you doing with it anyway.
What about your parole?
I'm a lot more worried about niggas in my building
than some parole officer.
All right, sit down.
See, man? This is what I'm talkin' about, man.
You being all righteous and judgin' me and shit.
Do me a favor and just sit down. Sit down now.
Look.
We got us a good thing, potentially.
Maybe nothing comes of it, but maybe something does.
If the joint works out,
maybe one day you could be the manager.
Shit, if it blows up,
you could run the whole fucking franchise.
But that means you gotta be careful.
That means you cannot be sent back inside.
We gotta follow the rules.
Hear me?
All right.
You gonna get rid of that thing?
Yeah.
All right.
Now that's what's being a man.
I'll need you to cut it.
How short?
This short.
I have a modeling career. If I cut it that short  
If you actually had a modeling career,
I would be speaking to your agency,
and not sitting in your apartment.
Do you want this job or not?
OK, yeah.
I can cut it.
All right.
And before we go to the studio,
I need to see how well-spoken you are.
Why does that matter?
Because you're gonna be on every news channel in America.
Wait. What's this for?
Read this. Those exact words.
Read 'em.
If you're good, you'll memorize them.
My name is Stephanie Daldry.
I am a professional model.
Freddy Hayes was convicted in 
for sticking up a convenience store in Columbia Heights.
During a high-speed pursuit,
Hayes lost control and crashed into another vehicle,
killing an elderly couple.
He avoided manslaughter charges
by pleading guilty to armed robbery.
He served nine years.
In  he opened Freddy's BBQ Joint,
a small restaurant specializing in ribs,
frequented by Vice President Frank Underwood.
Did you know?
No, I didn't.
You think it's Tusk?
Who else?
Who are you texting?
Seth.
All I want to do is make a short statement.
Freddy did his time.
He's been an upstanding citizen for  years.
He's a convicted felon who killed two senior citizens.
By accident.
Well, that's beside the point.
I am not gonna hang him out to dry.
If the Galloway story wasn't happening,
I'd say it's fine.
But it's too risky right now.
Think of how this is shaping up.
A vice president whose wife cheats on him
and who is friendly with a former gang-banger?
There is no way you win standing up for this guy.
He's about to start a franchise.
I will not have it jeopardized
because Tusk decides to come after   
Is more than just Freddy, sir.
I did some digging.
His son did time for narcotics, trafficking, distribution  
I've never met his son.
Let's hold off and tackle  
No. I want you to organize a press avail tomorrow morning.
Have Freddy brought over here.
Bring him through the back.
Yes, sir.
I won't leave one of my own bleeding on the field.
If you're gonna have the Washington Redskins,
then you're gonna have to have the New York Knickers.,
Pops, you ain't even deep like that.
Yo, back off, man.
Back the fuck off.
Darnell, just ignore them.
You think I'm fucking around?
Darnell, ignore them! Ignore 'em.
They can't take our pictures if we don't want them to.
Sure as hell can.
What you say?
The First fuckin' Amendment.
You gonna read me the constitution now, motherfucker?
Come on, Darnell. Let's just go on inside.
Nah, nah, I ain't done with this asshole.
Hey, don't touch me.
But you can get all up in my face
but I can't get up in yours?
  Listen to your daddy and chill out.   Darnell, let's go.
Don't push me.
I will fuck you up.
You think I'm scared of you?
You scared of this?
Darnell! Parole!
Can you tell me your name, please?
Stephanie Daldry.
I'm a professional model.
And this is you in this photo on the right?
Yes, that's correct.
We shot this photo yesterday with Ms. Daldry.
So you're suggesting that Mr. Galloway's photo is a fake?
I don't know anything about professional photography,
I'm just a flack.
But if we can create a fake in less than  hours,
I think an expert photographer like Adam Galloway  
Those are serious allegations,
especially given that Mr. Galloway vehemently denies it.
I'm not surprised he's denying.
Ultimately, though, it's gonna be your word against his.
Not my word.
The vice president of the United States'.
It's his word versus that of a potentially troubled man.
Troubled?
Potentially.
Or maybe he has a motive.
What motive could Mr. Galloway possibly have for a fake photo?
What would he get out of it?
I don't know.
My job is to separate fact from fiction,
just like yours is, Candy.
But maybe fact and fiction
don't matter as much to the artistic sensibility.
Maybe the lines are blurred for him.
This is not a man who stages fictitious scenarios.
Like I said, the art stuff, it's over my head.
And you may be right.
But I would hate to think
that Mr. Galloway was doing this just for publicity.
You think it's a publicity stunt.
Come on in.
Sir?
Is Freddy on his way?
There was an incident with his son.
What happened?
He's in custody for threatening a photographer with a firearm.
Jesus.
Where is Freddy now?
He's at home.
I have to go see him.
That's the projects, sir.
I don't care, you figure it out,
and the press can't know.
Yes, sir.
Francis, you know I love Freddy...
I'm going.
Freddy is dangerous because you care too much.
When we care too much, it blinds us.
What Tusk did is cheap.
And you're letting it get to you, which is exactly what he wants.
If I ignore this, if I do nothing  
It's not nothing.
Staying focused requires strength.
You want me to make something?
You go ahead. I'm not hungry.
You should eat.
I'm sorry. You didn't ask for this.
It's not fair to you.
All I want is to be done with it.
For my father to be all right.
If I thought there was any other way, that...
I didn't want to take the chance that he would  
I know.
These people.
I always knew they were ruthless, but...
We're caged up in here like animals.
They're painting me as some sort of...
And your family...
It's inhuman.
They're fucking inhuman.
Getting worked up isn't going to change anything.
Let me.
Hello?
Hey, Frank.
I'm fine.
Thanks for dropping by.
How you holdin' up?
I been better.
Ain't never seen you without a suit before.
We didn't want to draw too much attention.
Well, this is it, my castle.
Ain't as big as yours, but it'll do the job.
Blind Willie.,
Are you a blues fan?
"Dark Was the Night." Gets me every time.
Man, you shoulda told me that years ago.
I can jam, talking about some blues all day long.
Check this out. Original .
You want something?
Water? Iced tea?
I'd like some iced tea, thank you.
How's your son?
They set the bail at  grand.
Jesus.
How's your wife doing?
Oh, Claire's got a suit of armor three inches thick.
We'll get through all this garbage.
Somebody's tryin' to take you out?
Appears that way.
Whoever it is,
they done stepped on the wrong motherfuckin' rattlesnake.
That's why I'm here, Freddy.
I have to distance myself from you.
I need to make sure you're not going to play up
what good friends we've been.
That you've been to my office,
that you've cooked dinner at my home,
or that the president was there.
We can't drag him into anything.
And I won't be coming in for ribs anymore.
With all that's going on,
we can't add fuel to the fire.
You couldn't if you wanted to.
I'm selling it.
Selling the Joint?
That's right.
What are you talking about?
The franchise thing, with the sauce.
My business partner's pullin' out.
Say them white folks down in Silver Spring don't wanna
go to no place run by thugs.
Why do you have to sell yours?
Darnell's bail.
Doesn't that guy have to give you a hundred grand, regardless?
I ain't getting shit.
There's a morality clause in the contract.
But he's gonna pay me  thou for the storefront.
That with what little I got saved, I can pay that bond.
You can't sell Freddy's.
He's already drawing up the papers.
Let me help you with the money.
Nah, Frank.
We'll make it a loan.
You can pay me back.
Not gonna happen.
Don't be prideful.
  Frank.   Please, let me help.
I ain't takin' your guilt money.
When I was bangin',
we used to clear  Gs a month.
I seen guys shot down execution-style.
I didn't give a shit.
Then I got caught.
Darnell was born my first year in.
Never saw him once, not even a picture.
I can't take back the bad I done.
All I can do is to make my own way,
like I've been doing. You understand?
Ain't pride, Frank.
If you change your mind, you let me know.
You was a good customer, that's it.
You ain't gotta pretend to be my friend.
You take care of yourself, Freddy.
You too, Frank.
Do you think I'm a hypocrite?
Well, you should.
I wouldn't disagree with you.
The road to power is paved with hypocrisy...
...and casualties.
Never regret.
This way.
Have a seat, Adam.
You left your phone at home, as you were asked?
Yeah.
And what did you tell your fiance exactly?
That I'd be gone for a while.
She doesn't know where.
And what will she say if someone checks in on her?
What is this?
What will she say?
Francis.
We need to work together now.
I tried. You lied to me.
And I explained to you why that was necessary.
You didn't follow my instructions.
Do you know who Remy Danton is?
He approached you?
Inez's father is a human rights activist in Bogot.
The government has charged him with treason
for working with the rebels.
They're going for the death penalty,
and Danton said they have the judge in their pocket.
You should have come to us.
I said I would.
Danton said you couldn't do anything.
He's wrong.
I wasn't gonna take any chances.
Has he done what the government's claiming?
No. They're made-up charges.
He's a journalist
documenting atrocities in the Darien Gap.,
I can get the charges dropped.
Why should I trust you?
Because the secretary of state is a good friend of mine.
And you don't have any other choice.
We're not your chess pieces.
And this isn't a game, Mr. Galloway.
Then why are you toying with us?
We are trying to help.
That's a fucking joke, Claire.
Do not talk to my wife that way.
Your wife. What does that even mean to you?
Do not mistake any history you have shared
for the slightest understanding of what our marriage is
or how insignificant you are in comparison.
Can you give us a few minutes?
I'm gonna go call Cathy.
Forget my career and my reputation.
I want to marry this woman, Claire.
We're going to make this disappear.
Because of you I will always be the man
who placed her father in danger.
I can never erase that.
I'm sorry it's come to this.
I'm sorry I ever met you.
All you've ever done is cause me pain.
Now you're fucking with my life
and the life of the woman
that I love more than I ever loved you.
You'll be driven back to New York tonight.
In the morning, you'll make a statement saying
this was a publicity stunt,
and that the value of your work had been stagnating
  and you wanted to revive   No, Claire.
  I won't do that.   Yes, you will.
How about I tell the press,
  that you, that I was brought here   Adam, shut up!
That you wanted the attention, then you got cold feet,
denied it, then you changed your mind again.
And that you faked the shower photo
and you're coming clean.
Is that clear?
I'm not part of this world.
I didn't sign up for it. I have no interest in it.
We're giving you an out, Adam.
And if you choose not to take it,
I will bury you.
I've never hated anyone before.
Now I know what that feels like.
It's a terrible feeling, isn't it?
End call.
Call ended.
Call Raymond Tusk.
No answer at his place.
Is it a matter of more money?
Secretary Durant has already called President Moreno.
So we need to move quickly.
The minister of foreign affairs is involved now.
The judge isn't gonna rush a conviction in less than  hours.
Who do we know who has the minister's ear?
Nobody who can trump President Moreno.
And he's very sensitive to Durant's view on human rights.
Are you giving up on this?
No. Just being realistic.
Work on Moreno then.
We'll start leaving footprints.
Quiet.
Excuse me?
Oh, not you. My birds.
I think we need to be prepared
for the possibility that we can't follow through with our threat.
I am hearing excuses, not solutions.
My hands are tied.
I can't circumvent the entire US State Department.
You know, I hired you to destroy Frank.
You're failing.
Look, Raymond, I'm your lobbyist,
not your henchman.
I don't employ lobbyists.
I employ people who can be useful to me.
And you are proving otherwise.
Quiet now.
I'll figure something out.
Soon.
Okay, that's good.
You don't have to do this.
Yeah, I do.
The charges are dropped.
They lied to you.
You can lie to them.
New charges can always be filed.
It's not worth the risk.
Ok.
Are you disappointed in me?
Let's just get it over with.
OK, go ahead.
I'd like to make a statement.
There will be a little cleanup,
some folks who will want to linger on the story,
but we're over the hump, I'd say.
So we can leave the house now?
The sooner you get back to normal work, the better.
All the meetings I had to cancel,
let's find a way to get them back on the books.
Yes, sir.
I need to push ahead with the Assault Bill.
We've got your Matt Bai interview lined up for tomorrow,
but I think that  
Maybe we should hold off on Bai
till after things quiet down.
That's exactly what I was gonna suggest.
Doug is right.
OK, let's get going.
I'll meet you in the car.
He's done a good job handling all this.
Yes, he has.
Should we have any more concerns?
He claims he doesn't have anything else.
Do you believe him?
I wouldn't go that far.
Keep an eye on him.
I plan to.
As for Raymond, we have to strike back hard and fast.
I want him obliterated.
More than that.
Let's make him suffer.
I don't know whether to be proud or terrified.
Perhaps both.
Wish I could do more.
What you gonna do with her?
I don't know yet.
Probably have to knock it down.
It's worth more as an empty lot.
Is there anything else you wanna take?
A memento or something?
Nah.
I ain't one for lookin' back.
Eyes ahead.
Good luck, Freddy.House.of.Cards.SE
Look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.
"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,,
by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour,
and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice.
And be kind to one another,
tenderhearted,
forgiving one another."
Do you want me to keep going with this, or something else?
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.
Doug, there's something I need to talk to you about.
You said that she was just staying for a few nights.
Her roommate kicked her out. She doesn't have anywhere else to go.
Not our problem.
I can't put her out on the street.
What's her name?
  Lisa.   Lisa what?
You don't have anything to worry about.
Where is she now?
At the fellowship.
There's a sleepover with some of the kids from the day care.
Does she know about me?
No, I haven't told her anything.
I have given you space. I trusted you, Rachel,
  and you've taken advantage     I'm not kicking her out.
I could have said nothing, but I told you.
I have to go.
She better be gone by the next time we talk.
Sir.
What took you so long?
I can have a briefing ready in five minutes.
Don't bother. I had Seth do it.
He doesn't have security clearance.
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.
I'll see you in my office.
Japanese sovereignty is a matter of precedent.
Mr. Prime Minister, my concern is escalation.
Well, I'm asking for a small portion of the th Fleet.,
We must bring China into line.
Show them that the U.S. and Japan maintain a strong alliance.
Have you reached out directly to Beijing?
No recognition that the island belongs to Japan.
Well, I'd like to speak to my team and formulate a plan.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Admiral, for those catching up...
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters
within three miles of Yonaguni Island here,
approximately six hours ago.
See how close the island is to Taiwan.
This is different than the standoff over the Senkaku Islands.
It could have to do with shipping routes.
Or the trade war. They can't pick on the big kids,
so they're picking on the little one.
  Do you see that?   What?
In the alley, camera two.
All posts, white male, hooded sweatshirt, duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair St.
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag and place your hands on your head.
Stay right where you are.
Mrs. Underwood?
Will you come downstairs, please?
Where's Francis?
He got delayed at the White House, there was an emergency meeting.
What's going on?
I'll explain in the safe room.
The th Fleet is near Guam?
Ninety miles north.
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.
But even sending them in that direction
will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.
Well, we have to stand with our allies, that can't be in question.
What if we don't send ships, just make a strong statement
condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive
to call back their destroyers.
Whatever overtures we make,
I'd like to have contingency plans in place.
Already drafting them, sir.
Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.
See if there's a concrete ask,
if they don't have one, let's create a list of options.
Right away, sir.
How about coordination with the Japanese navy?
Go.
Don't engage with our navy yet.
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro
and express our intentions.
Former marine.
He showed up at the outer perimeter with explosives
in a duffel bag and strapped to his body.
Jesus.
We apprehended him. The press isn't aware.
Well, let's keep it that way.
He claimed he was responsible for sending
the package of white powder to the Capitol.
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.
Not exactly.
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.
Oh, my god. It was me.
Yes, you were the target.
We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood,
until we can confirm he was acting alone.
I'll stay.
No. You have to get back to the White House.
I can work from here.
Francis, I'm fine. Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent on  
No, I want it to be Meechum.
Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
It's OK.
Don't go to California.
Be nice to be reelected.
You're gonna win.
Not if I don't give the voters more face time.
When did you get it?
The Army?
Yeah.
It's grown since then.
Tell me about it.
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
What are you doing?
Tell me about the tattoo.
That's not fair.
So what?
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?
I don't think so...
...I know so.
Tell me.
I like the pain.
Of the needle?
Yeah.
How bad did it hurt?
It hurt a lot.
You like when it hurts?
I killed a lot of people.
What?
In the Army.
The pain...
...it helped.
Finish.
The most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA
when he opened his first plant,
but that was almost  years ago.
We need more.
I want Tusk gone.
Doyle and I will keep looking.
If you haven't found anything now,
what makes you think you will?
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.
You want to shift tactics?
The casino. We go public as soon as possible.
You said that was a last resort.
Seth, you need to find a way
to make that happen so it doesn't link back to us.
If we launch that missile,
it could blow us up too.
Not if we spin it right.
  If we keep the focus on     Seth.
You're here to listen, not contribute.
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.
Sir... he's been sitting with this for three hours.
I've been working on it for three months.
And accomplished nothing.
It's time we go on the offensive.
What do you think?
Ayla Sayyad.
She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
How close is she?
She never mentioned a casino,
but now that I know what the dots are,
I can see that she's starting to connect them.
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.
I hear there have been regular meetings
in the Situation Room since last night.
Let me call you right back.
  Hello?   Hey, Lynne, it's Ayla.
I just sent you a picture.
  Yeah, I got it.   What does it mean?
  It's strange, it doesn't really make sense.   Tell me.
"Pursue currency" would be like the most literal translation.
Or "pursue money."
Follow the money?
  That could work.   Thanks, Lynne.
I like what you've done.
This sofa, it's new? These lamps as well?
I've made a few changes.
You get so used to a place,
the smallest things stand out.
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.
I've been focused on the midterms.
Oh, there's no need to explain.
Mrs. Underwood,
you know how much I respect your intentions,
but I've thought deeply about this and
I can't cosponsor the bill in its current form.
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step,
but I'd be happy to revisit some of
the other less extreme proposals.
You think we're being extremist?
I want to help with this issue,
but this bill goes through  
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.
And I can't be one of them.
So you lied to us.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
I want to help.
As long as we rethink some of the language.
Are you trying to distance yourself from us
because of the Galloway scandal?
  No.   Maybe you think it hurts your chances
of reelection if you associate with me.
That's not it. It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.
Do you realize the message this sends?
The only woman in congressional leadership in both parties,
and you bow out?
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't just bow out.
I'll actively fight it.
You never asked my position.
You assumed.
I can't imagine what that position must be.
I've served in war zones,
I know firsthand how important  
We're not talking about war zones.
We're talking about sexual assault.
How about a military commission to review the internal mechanisms
We don't need more studies. We need reform.
Well, let's continue this conversation
when I return from California.
I'll be back the day after tomorrow,
if you change your mind.
I won't.
But I hope you change yours.
China was insulted at the notion we could buy them off.
Well, do I need to call President Qian?
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.
See if he's willing to talk one on one.
You should know, sir,
Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.
They're upping the ante.
Have Ambassador Hines get in touch with the prime minister,
and ask if Japan will hold off
until I make contact with Beijing.
Yes, sir.
Have you gotten any rest at all?
No, have you?
Not yet.
How's Claire?
Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt,
but they're being cautious.
After the Galloway thing and the interview,
half the country thinks she's a baby killer,
or an adulterer, or both.
But Claire's taking it in stride. We're in good hands.
That's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.
One of us should,
probably the one that's calling all the shots.
No, I can hold out a little while longer.
No, go to the residence, spend some time with your wife.
You'll come back feeling like a new man.
Honestly, it's...
less stressful here.
Counseling hasn't helped?
No, it has... slowly.
I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned.
I heard.
It's improved things some, but...
...there's still work to do.
Makes me tired just to think about it.
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first
president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.
  I was joking.   I wasn't.
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.
I'll let you be.
No, stick around.
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.
Like death, it puts even the most powerful men on their backs.
DC Limo and Bus Rental.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
We've got a corporate account.
Let's see...
Yeah, I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.
My mistake. I must have called the wrong limo service. Thank you.
Missouri Bus and Limo.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
You're not Darlene.
No. Darlene is out sick.
I'm filling in for her. My name is Pam.
How can I help you, Pam?
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.
We'll need some transportation.
How many you got coming?
I don't have the manifest right
The usual?
That's right.
So a luxury bus.
How many does that fit?
Usually about  come in.
  Should be plenty of room.   That's great. Thanks.
Do you think it's really her conscience,
or because the bill is controversial?
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us
if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.
I'll talk to her.
I really want this bill to pass.
I know you do, so do I.
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.
I'm damaged goods,
this whole Adam thing.
No, you're not.
We fought past that.
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.
We'll get it passed, I promise.
No, thanks.
Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.
We could just go for a run.
No more runs until the death threats die down,
that's the new rule.
But they let you go to the office.
Because I was in a bulletproof car.
Does this mean we've officially not quit?
We've never been quitters, have we?
Sir, Mrs. Underwood,
sorry to interrupt.
I was gonna head home,
but I'll stick around if you want me to.
Oh, no. You've been up long enough. Get some sleep.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Thank you for looking after me today.
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
He's very dedicated.
He is.
It's rare to find someone like Edward.
What?
You never use his first name.
Oh, did I?
I don't feel right talking about her like this.
It's just... technically, she's my boss now.
There's a certain protocol.
This is coming directly from Doug.
Which means it's coming directly from the vice president.
I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.
Do you know what he and the congresswoman were discussing?
No, they were private meetings.
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.
Most of the time pretty late at night.
Did the money originate in China?
The money came from tribal revenue.
As our FEC reports clearly stated.
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue come from
Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?
We have visitors from all over the world.
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.
I have no idea who that is.
I'm looking at FAA flight records that show
a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City.
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo,
which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.
Ms. Said  
Sayyad.
Ms. Sayyad, the only reason I returned your call
was because you work for The Telegraph.
It's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.
But I don't know what you're trying to get at here,
so if you'll excuse  
What about Raymond Tusk?
What about him?
Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the president.
You have ties to Feng.
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political  
What you're insinuating is not only wrong,
it's libelous.
Not if it's true.
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.
Tusk made the same threat.
If a man worth   billion doesn't intimidate me,
you certainly don't, Mr. Lan  
Hello?
He hung up.
I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.
You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?
Desperate men are capable of anything.
I want it to go away just like you do.
Then pull her back.
I have no control over the press, Raymond.
You'll destroy yourself, Frank, not me.
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.
Work with Doyle,
make sure we have no weak spots.
I'll call him now.
What did Nancy say?
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.
These links are supported by fact.
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.
I'm not saying the headline should read:
Money Laundering Scheme Exposed! Exclamation point.
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
We're first and foremost a financial paper.
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.
So we just protect him?
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.
If there's any basis for litigation,
you can be sure his team will be aggressive.
They've bankrupted papers before.
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When, and if, you have a story  
Mr. Maxfield,
Raymond Tusk is on the line.
Did you put in a call to him?
Yesterday.
He's specifically asking for you, sir.
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than  minutes ago.
That means that Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the White House?
They're not talking to anyone until after the president
does his press briefing tomorrow.
All right.
Walk me through all of this again, point by point.
Meechum.
We can talk tomorrow, sir.
No. What is it?
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full-time.
At least until the death threats quiet down.
That's very thoughtful.
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.
Have you spoken to Claire?
When she came home. She likes the idea.
Then I think we should do it.
I'll let Agent Rockland know.
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.
You didn't interrupt anything.
Good night, sir.
Good night, Meechum.
You'll never believe what just happened.
What?
Meechum came into the office
and found me watching something...
...other than the news.
Oh, no.
He was very professional about it.
  Were you...?   No, no, no. I was just watching.
That's really funny.
What about you? What are you watching?
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.
I forgot about that.
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Let me see.
...been there, like I have.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in them...
  My God, look how young we are.   I know.
Everyone here has been so kind, and so welcoming.
We'll have her rooting for Clemson before too long.
That's where I have to draw the line.
Do you miss being with Adam?
Where did that come from?
Miss it? No.
Well, you must, sometimes.
He meant a lot to me for a while.
But that's done now.
What about you?
What about me?
Are you unsatisfied?
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.
We don't have the freedom we once did.
Maybe it's better this way.
No room for distractions.
I don't mind the sacrifice.
We chose this instead.
I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.
See, he's just trying to get under my skin.
No, it's not even debatable...
How was California?
Exhausting.
Is this the Golden Gate?
Yes.
I had an etching right there of the Capitol before it was finished.
Took  years to complete it.
How long did it take to complete the bridge.
Uh, about four years.
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
That was a man who got things done.
Strong beliefs. and he stuck to them.
But compromised when he had to.
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen cosponsors on either side of the aisle.
  It's a serious bill.   I don't disagree.
Except with the language.
I can explain my thinking,
but I doubt I'll convince you anymore  
Putting aside the military's honor,
chain of command, all the things that you hold dear...
...let's consider one simple fact.
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.
I'm not trying to pull strings,
but you could show a little gratitude.
If it were anything else,
Mr. Vice President...
but not this.
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.
It's not inevitable. Claire doesn't have the votes yet.
You really want to fight us on this.
I don't want to fight you at all,
which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down  
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!
Cosponsor the bill,
whip the damn votes,
I'm no longer asking.
Then I'm no longer listening.
You don't have just this office to thank me for.
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.
What do you mean?
Why don't you ask Remy Danton.
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.
You keep up the good work, Nancy.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
I miss having you around,
but you're my eyes and ears now,
otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me that you say that.
Doug?
I'm busy.
The story just broke.
They timed it with the president's press conference.
Connect me with the vice president.
So the th Fleet is currently positioned near Guam,
where it will remain
if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.
I've been in frequent touch with prime minister Oshiro,
and have made personal overtures to President Qian.
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled
without any further escalations.
So, with that, I'll take some questions.
Henry, you first.
Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article  
I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet. Yeah, Jane?
Mr. President,
would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?
I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations. Mark?
The article mentions Xander Feng,
a wealthy and influential Chinese businessman   
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made...
It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties to the standing committee
and we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.
  Economically   Thank you all very much.
It's not beginning the story that I fear,
it's not knowing how it will end.
Everyone is fair game now,
including me.
This is par for the course,
for what we've come to expect from President Walker.
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car,
he can't say enough about it.
The engine breaks down,
the transmission gives out,
he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
I'm gonna tell you something,
our warranty is the constitution of the United States,
and there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print
and start answering our questions.
If any of this is true,
we're talking Congress, the White House,
both parties...
Now, I'm saying "If,"
but when it looks like dirty money,
and it smells like dirty money,
somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.
Look, there's no real proof this money laundering is even  
The connections are troubling,
especially Underwood.
He was the House whip the entire time Adohi were
contributing to the Democrats,
and he's working side by side with the president now.
The president. So this goes all the way to the White House?
  It might.   It's hypothetical.
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.
I'm not making a case.
PAC Money Raises Questions.
And it has.
I haven't answered those questions,
but I think the American people deserve answers. Don't you?
You can bet your bottom dollar
the attorney general is gonna investigate.
With the firestorm this is causing in the media  
What's our course of action?
As your counsel, I would encourage you
not to speak to the press until we have more information.
As your average citizen,
the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.
If there's been any irregularity,
I had nothing to do with it.
Your friendship with Tusk
implies guilt by association.
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?
I'm a lawyer,
I presume nothing.
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.
Give us a few moments.
I have to advise you not to have any conversation
about this matter without me present.
Your advisement has been noted.
I'll be right outside.
Is this what you were keeping from me?
We should follow your counsel's advice, and not   
Tell me if it's true, about the money.
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to all sort of  
Damn it, Frank! I've been in the dark too long on this.
That ends now.
I don't know any details.
Feng told me if the Bridge project got approved,
the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it, the money stopped.
Jesus Christ, that connects the White House directly to the money.
No, sir.
You knew nothing, you still know nothing.
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money  
That's Raymond Tusk's head,
not yours. You've done nothing wrong.
Guilt by association, Frank. You heard the man.
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.
Well, bruises you can survive.
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.
We could always have the attorney general appoint a special prosecutor
That's a terrible idea.
Maybe so.
And given where we are, Frank,
I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.
Well, I wasn't suggesting it as something you should do.
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I   I don't think you should.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.
Let the public fatigue on it.
And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?
It'll lose steam.
What if it doesn't.
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes
in the South China Sea.
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.
Maybe you're right then. A special prosecutor is the way to go.
I didn't say that, you did.
Oh, no. I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.
It wouldn't be on my plate if you kept me better informed.
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I just went through?
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.
I will take the fall if it comes to that,
but it won't.
However you decide to deal with this,
I think your instincts are right.
We probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.
Send Bill back in.
You knew about this.
Tusk is a client,
  doesn't mean I know everything     Bullshit.
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill
is because you know the things nobody else does.
What do you want me to say?
Is it true?
We don't talk about work.
We're not in bed,
we're in my fucking office.
And in here,
you work for Frank.
I work for no one but myself.
Keep telling yourself that.
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods
for whoever can pay the highest retainer.
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs,
I'm fully aware and willing,
but you're worse.
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.
That's not true.
Case in fucking point.
Don't turn this. You knew about the money and you didn't tell me.
Even though it's thrown my seat into contention.
Let's say there was money,
and let's say I did know,
what good would it have done?
It means you were willing to watch me lose!
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.
  No changes, no special treatment.   This is different!
So now we're making exceptions?
When it's this important, yes!
You can't have it both ways.
Were you...?
Was I what?
...fucking me to get info on Frank?
Is that what you think?
I don't know what to think.
I care about you more than I should,
but I'm getting tired of having to say it.
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment.
then a high-security detention center until the official sentencing.
Well, that's good to hear.
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.
My bill is about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.
Your death threats continue to rise.
We can't take the risk.
Am I even allowed to leave the house?
Of course. But we want you to avoid large crowds.
Our ability to protect  
Mr. Vice President.
Anything wrong?
We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on her new security protocol.
Can we actually finish this later?
Of course.
How did it go?
He's skeptical.
Should I call Tricia?
No. It could look like I was trying to go behind his back.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.
Hopefully, he'll disagree with it.
But this could've been the wrong move.
Well, don't doubt yourself.
Seth has gotten over , e-mails in the last six hours.
The phones are overloaded.
So you ignore all that?
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.
What can I do?
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.
You don't have to stand by that door.
Take a load off.
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.
Well, I won't tell if you won't.
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this,
or anything,
they can talk to me.
Beautiful night.
Yes, sir.
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.
You want me to switch back to your detail?
No, no. I'm glad you're with Claire.
I just didn't realize how much
I got used to your company until you were gone.
Protecting her is the same as protecting you in my mind.
Oh, come on.
Why do you do this?
Do what, sir?
I've always been awestruck.
People who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.
It's how I serve my country.
Well, there's a lotta ways to serve your country.
And this is my way.
Oh, I haven't finished with this one yet.
It's not for you.
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.
It's not for you either.
Well, come on over and join the party.
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?
Never, ma'am.
To Meechum,
for his loyalty and service.
To Edward.
I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.
And I say "us," Remy,
because your skin is in this game now, too.
Are you gonna deny?
Of course I'm gonna deny.
Every step of this was legal.
They can't prove the links between them.
What about Lanagin?
He'll cooperate. It's Feng we need to worry about.
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.
We do have one major advantage.
The public can hate me,
but as long as Clayton West remains profitable,
my stockholders won't care.
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.
I can work with the Republicans on that.
Well, we'll be under the magnifying glass too.
This will be a witch hunt.
I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.
What you need to do is go after the leadership.
Make them hurt.
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.
Birch, Womack, Sharp.
Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.
Remy?
I heard you.
I got my marching orders.
I'm counting on you.
I'll deliver.
Let's talk in the morning.
The two names I like the most
are Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.
Gaines has better credentials.
But he's close to the administration.
I would've made him a federal judge
if the GOP hadn't blocked it.
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit. She's more than qualified.
And there's no baggage there.
But she's more unpredictable.
Well, I doubt the attorney general would have put her on his list
if he thought she was a wild card.
Sir, I have to say,
I think this step is premature.
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.
I don't want to do it, Bill
But my fear is this.
If we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling,
we seem reactionary, not proactive.
But proactive could also seem defensive.
Like the suspect that screams "I didn't do it"
before anyone asks.
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.
Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
That defeats the purpose.
Then a few days.
I'd like to go with Dunbar.
  Sir     I've made my decision.
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the attorney general.
Ultimately, the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring him.
Of course not.
Thank you, sir.
The only thing more satisfying than
convincing someone to do what I want,
is failing to persuade them on purpose.
It's like a "Do Not Enter" Sign,
it just begs you to walk through the door.
Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.
Every donor,
every political event.
Everything that Dunbar might be looking into.
Good. Seth?
We avoid any official statement,
follow the president's cue.
In the meantime, I'd like to make some off the record calls.
You welcome the investigation,
it's the right step, et cetera.
Give folks the personal touch.
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.
I'd like to see a list of who you'd be calling.
Some of this is gonna be on the fly,
it'd be great if I had a little leeway.
Let Seth do his thing, you'll have your hands full with Doyle.
I'll let you know who I've called.
All right, let's get to work.
Sir?
Yes, what is it?
I understand that you need to delegate,
but when you contradict me in front of Seth,
it compromises my authority over him.
You can't micromanage, we have too much to do.
Seth is still new to the team.
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.
Well, I think he is.
I am your failsafe, sir.
But I can't be that if you won't let me.
Are you, Doug? My failsafe?
Do you doubt that?
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane,
and you're talking office politics
instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.
You're right, sir. I shouldn't have brought it up.
Is she still there?
Yeah. I told her I was going for a walk.
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone,
but you have to understand that all I'm asking is   
She can stay.
What?
She doesn't have to leave. She can stay.
I trust you to be smart.
Will you read to me?
My bible is inside.
Doesn't have to be the bible.
Just pull up something on your phone.
Like what?
Tale of Two Cities. My mom used to read it to me.
It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
the winter of despair,
we had everything before us,
we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven,
we were all going direct the other way."
Hello?
Doug, is that you?
Hello?
Hello?
Doug?
Yes, Doug, it is you.House.of.Cards.SE
The Vice President just entered the Department of Justice.
We're here with Ayla Sayyad,
whose Wall Street Telegraph article
catalyzed the investigation. Ayla.
The issue at stake is whether the White House was in any way involved.
Was foreign money traded for political favors?
Did it influence diplomatic relations?
Just the act of laundering Chinese contributions is illegal.
If it had a significant impact on White House policy,
that's a far more serious crime.
You've met with Daniel Lanagin on multiple occasions.
We were in the same room, yes, on  occasions since .
But we only spoke on three of those occasions.
Those instances are highlighted.
What did you discuss?
Well, these were fundraisers.
I speak to dozens of people,
usually about nothing at all.
I'm southern, Ms. Dunbar.
My mother taught me that
conversation during mealtime is not only polite,
it aids the digestive process.
So you didn't speak to him
about the Adohi tribe's contributions to any of these super PACs?
Absolutely not.
I never discuss super PACs with any supporters.
We both know the law.
During one of these polite conversations,
do you recall Mr. Lanagin ever mentioning Xander Feng?
I do not.
Does that name mean anything to you?
Other than being plastered all over the news?
In that regard it means as much as Kim Kardashian.
Then let me be more specific.
What knowledge do you have of Mr. Feng's political activities?
Is this coming from your husband, or is it...?
From me.
And it's not that I don't support the bill anymore.
It's just the article.
We've promised Matt an interview.
Maybe in a few weeks,
once the investigation has died down.
The New York Times isn't going to wait for us.
They've already scheduled the cover for October.
Based on our timing   
Then I can't be a part of it.
It's the Galloway nonsense, isn't it?
Claire, come on.
It's okay.
You can say so. We're friends.
It doesn't help.
You don't actually believe I   
No.
But enough of the country still does.
And Garrett needs every bit of support he can get right now.
So there's no convincing you?
I'll help as much as I can.
Quietly.
There are rumors that you and Mr. Feng
served as back channels to the trade summit last May.
Exactly. Rumors.
We have Feng in the U.S. during the summit.
Well, if he was back-channeling,
and even if I were aware,
any form of diplomatic communication is usually classified.
Have you ever discussed Feng with the President?
Any major player in Beijing is worthy of discussion.
So that's a yes.
It's a general comment.
Did you discuss him during the energy crisis?
I assuming you're alluding to the refinery co-venture with   
Yes. With Raymond Tusk.
The refinery was never part of our conversation.
We needed an immediate solution.
A refinery would have solved nothing in the short term.
And it's my understanding that deal fell through.
Correct. But Tusk did receive a subsidy.
As did every other nuclear energy provider.
But his connection with Feng,
then a subsidy on samarium   
Nobody made any profits off these subsidies.
At best they were breaking even.
In fact, Raymond fought us on the issue.
Then let's back up to the Port Jefferson Bridge.
I don't blame her. It's a valid concern.
Tell him I won't engage on Galloway,
so there's no point in asking.
This is Matt Bai.
We can't dictate what he'll ask. And he will ask.
Well, then I'll just say I won't answer tabloid questions.
It's a legitimate question.
How the scandal could affect the vote.
Look, I say you pull out, too.
We scrap the whole piece.
Jackie is fighting us.
The leadership is noncommittal.
We need this article to refocus attention.
But it'll hurt you.
Both your personal image and the bill.
But if we cut the cord,
we schedule two interviews,
then we cancel, won't Matt be furious?
The story will be about pulling out.
We're talking about the lesser of two evils.
I don't want you to become the target,
  to undo all the work   Then what if it's not me at all?
But you said the first lady wasn't going   
Not her. Someone else.
Was the bridge a trade-off to prevent additional GOP funding?
As far as I know,
the bridge was a delivery on a promise
the president had made to the voters.
Are we finished here?
Almost.
How many members of Congress have you interviewed, Ms. Dunbar?
About ?
Well, I want to be of help,
but I doubt I can offer any more than the  that preceded me.
I have gotten some useful testimony.
  From who?   A high-ranking House member.
In the leadership?
I'm not at liberty to say.
Bob Birch? Jackie Sharp?
This individual says he attended a meeting
July th in the Oval Office.
She said "He," so it must have been Birch.
I'm sure Raymond had no trouble buying him off.
You attended that meeting also.
It appears so.
Do you recall the subject of that meeting?
A wave of conservative attack ads.
We were being outspent.
It must have been quite a shock
when Lanagin's tribe shifted contributions to the other party,
when they hadn't given a single dime to the Republicans before that.
Well, it would have been a shock,
but we didn't know where the money was coming from at the time.
According to my source...
Bob Birch.
My source says the estimate was  million.
You said, and I quote,
"With this kind of influx,
you can be sure somebody isn't playing by the rules."
Sounds like something I might say.
Bob has a better memory than me.
The money stopped just after
the Port Jefferson Bridge was approved.
Is there a theory here,
or are you just grasping at straws?
The bridge leads to Feng.
Feng gives me Lanagin and Tusk.
Tusk and the president   
Ms. Dunbar, you want to play six degrees of separation,
you could throw in Jimmy Hoffa and the pope.,
Then how about one degree of separation?
Douglas Stamper, your chief of staff.
This is him at Lanagin's casino July th.
I used these to get a warrant for flight records.
The next day, Mr. Stamper was on a flight to Beijing.
Why was he at the casino?
And why was he in Beijing?
I would like to speak to my client.
Please.
I work hard.
I keep things simple. I know what my priorities are.
But there's this    this person.
She's not even in my life, except on the edges,
making things blurrier.
It doesn't tempt me to drink.
It's more like she   
it's more like she feels what it was like when I was drinking.
When I couldn't get enough.
No matter how many drinks I had,
I wanted another.
I    I don't want to be with her.
I mean, I    I    I do.
But
it's more like she's my daughter.
Or my mother.
I don't know. This is fucked up.
Take your time.
I should cut her off.
The way I did with booze.
That's all. I'm done.
Thanks for sharing.
We'll need some time before responding to your questions.
I could wait as long as necessary.
It could take a while.
There are national security matters at stake.
The vice president needs to consult with his advisors.
National security?
Are you really gonna play that card, Oliver?
His answers could entail classified material.
When can we expect a response?
I'll let you know.
May we hold onto the screen cap?
Be my guest.
We'll be in touch soon, Ms. Dunbar.
Mr. Vice President?
If you think you're insulated, don't.
Our investigation is much bigger than Douglas Stamper.
That's enough, Ms. Dunbar.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Vice President.
Happy to cooperate.
From the lion's den to a pack of wolves.
When you're fresh meat, kill,
and throw them something fresher.
Hey, I'm Fitz.
Doug.
Yeah, you know, uh, you can isolate,
white-knuckle this shit if you want.
Or you can ask for help.
Got a sponsor?
No. It's been  years. I'm good.
Number's on the back, if you change your mind.
Thought you had a driver.
I do.
I didn't want him overhearing anything.
You shouldn't even be near this state.
I'm not really here.
Long layover on my way to California.
I've got auditors,
federal agents in my office,
going through every file, every document.
They're going through my god damn trash.
Just stick to the Fifth if she subpoenas you.
Well, how do they know to look for Stamper?
To search the tapes on that exact day?
Don't jump to conclusions.
You're throwing me under the bus.
Underwood's the roadkill. Not you.
They're going to fuck me.
They'll find a way.
  And you know that.   And if that's the case,
you and your family will be taken care of.
They're already offering me a plea.
You haven't even been charged yet.
If I cooperate.
You'll do less time,
but your family will have nothing.
They'll still have nothing when you get out.
You testify against Raymond,
and he'll still walk because all they'll have is your word.
And that doesn't count for much right now.
You wouldn't be here if he wasn't afraid.
I'm not here because he's afraid.
I'm here because you are.
And I want to make sure you don't do anything stupid.
After repeated conversations with Beijing
they remain intractable in their position.
This morning I gave orders for a carrier group
to reposition near Okinawa.
This won't put our ships in direct confrontation
with the Chinese vessels,
but it will put them within reach of airstrikes.
I'll be informing the Chinese ambassador later today.
We'll release a statement in coordination with the Pentagon.
Sir, our stockpiles of samarium
will only last another two months at most.
If we go this route   
Yeah, I've    I've heard everyone's concerns.
And this is the decision I've made.
Any questions?
Okay. Thank you.
Frank.
How'd it go?
We have a few follow-up questions that we have to address.
Like what?
Oh, nothing major.
Just odds and ends. A few details.
I was under the impression this would be short and sweet.
So was I, but she's very deliberate.
We need this over, Frank.
At least as far as the White House is concerned.
We can't be distracted.
Not with warships on the move.
I'm confident we're in the home stretch.
Well, you seem more concerned than you're letting on.
Oh, no, not at all.
You're fidgeting.
It's my class ring.
I forget I   
I buried it.
You what?
I    it's a long story.
I've never seen you this stressed before, Frank.
Well, I've never seen you this tired before, sir.
You've got rings of your own.
Dark ones.
Yeah, they're getting worse, aren't they?
You should take more naps on those sofas in the Oval.
Oh, naps don't cut it these days, Frank.
Not even a dent.
Lie after lie.
First to a prosecutor, then to a president.
I feel exposed.
Like the skin where my ring used to be.
Even Achilles was only as strong as his heel.
Where's Doug? He's not answering his phone.
He went to a meeting, sir.
In the middle of the day?
I think he's on his way back now.
I want him back now as soon as possible.
Sir, this arrived for you.
The watch you gave Remy when he left for Glendon Hill.
I recognized it from the quote on the back.
Was there a message?
No. Just the watch.
Let's find Doug.
Right away, sir.
Forgive the plastic.
Luc Tuymans. He's the real thing.
Well, I'll take your word.
It's not mine. None of it.
California, you want to sell your house,
your realtor decorates it.
Well, one room at least.
Where you moving?
Oh, I have a little ranch in Sonoma.
My wife's gone.
My kids won't talk to me.
But at least I'll have my painting.
You paint?
No. And there's no ranch.
But the rest of it    the rest of it's true.
Cheers.
I'm here about Jacqueline Sharp.
We're thinking of hiring her.
A lobbyist?
She could lose her re-elect.
Not a great time to be an incumbent.
I know you two are close.
So, you're looking for what?
A recommendation?
We have the lowest turnover of any shop on K Street.,
There's a reason.
What are you looking for at Glendon Hill?
A killer instinct.
Well, she certainly has that.
Forgive me if I'm prying,
but did she have anything to do with your, uh...
Departure?
Jackie did what she had to do.
I'll never forgive her.
But I understand why she did it.
Did what exactly?
I paid cash for my ticket.
I was careful.
Clearly not enough.
Sir, the casino had cameras everywhere.
There was no way to avoid them.
But there had to have been thousands of hours of footage.
Now how they found that   
I have to ask you a question, Doug.
And I'm sorry, but I need you to be honest.
Are you drinking again?
God no.
Truly?
It's not an option.
Because it would explain a lot.
You have every right to be upset.
  This was my fault.   I'm more concerned than I'm upset.
I need you now, Doug.
More than ever.
I know.
We're not young men.
If we fail, we'll die in a cage.
I haven't been myself lately.
That's what you said to me  years ago.
When I gave you a second chance, it paid off.
You got clean, Doug.
Nothing means more to me than this job, sir. Nothing.
Whatever's going on,
I need to know that it can be managed.
And if you need my help,
I'm here to help you.
I'm good, sir.
I can handle myself. Things'll be different.
I've never given someone a third chance.
Until this very moment.
And I'm grateful.
You won't regret it.
Please believe that, sir.
It was Remy who alerted them to the footage.
His going-away gift.
Read the back.
What do you think he's trying to say?
I don't know, but track him down and set up a meeting.
What about Dunbar?
We can't run from the facts.
I'll say whatever you want me to say.
I'll take responsibility for all of it.
She could indict you.
That's what having a staff is for.
I have a better solution.
  We'll both take responsibility.   How?
Set up an interview with Dunbar. Day after tomorrow.
  You and I need time to do our homework.   Yes, sir.
When did this happen?
Meechum helped me fix it.
If they're not gonna let me run, I have to work out some way.
You carried it all the way up here?
For privacy. I had help.
  Meechum.   That's right.
Well, he's a jack of all trades.
  Handyman. Furniture mover.   Human shield.
How bad is it?
Bad.
They have evidence of Doug being where he shouldn't have been.
What are you gonna do?
Tell the truth.
  You're not actually gonna      Selectively.
Don't worry.
It's a stumble, not a fall.
You aren't like this when it's just a stumble.
  Like how?   You're scared. I can tell.
Shoot for that.
How have you been?
Okay.
  The meds are helping.   Oh, that's good to hear.
Let's have a seat.
Those people at the end of the street...
it's intense.
They're there  . Twice as many on the weekends.
We're so used to it by now.
Can I take off my shoes?
I thought I should dress up, but I am not good with heels.
Yes. Of course.
My mom said they went with the dress.
Much better.
Look, Megan,
I know the last six months have been difficult,
but I need your help.
We just don't have the support that we expected in the leadership.
Yeah, I figured this wasn't just about checking up on me.
You changed your mind before, and I understand why.
But now it seems as though things are more stable with you.
Are you willing?
It's hard to say no when I'm in your house.
Well, you hear those people out there.
They're loud, but I think we need to be louder.
And it can't be my voice,
because I'm the baby killer, the cheater.
It needs to be your voice.
A clear voice.
I'm already testifying at the court martial.
But that's closed to the media.
It's not enough.
There are so many people this has happened to.
Why does it have to be me?
Because you're the one who called.
Are you gonna try to put it out before McGinnis gets sentenced?
Seth? You have a minute?
Matt, I have to call you back.
Close the door.
When the vice president brought you on board,
I advised against it.
But I can't deny you've done a good job.
I appreciate you saying that.
I'm very protective of the vice president.
I find it hard to share that duty with anyone else,
which leaves me open to error.
It's one of my faults.
As I told the vice president,
I understand that trust is something that I need to earn.
And given how I got the job   
If the vice president trusts you, then I trust you.
We're a team now.
And the truth is I can't do this alone.
Anything and everything you ask of me.
It might have nothing to do with the media.
Press Secretary is just a title.
Good.
We have two tasks.
First, find me Remy Danton.
But be discreet.
I'll track him down.
Second, I need you to go through the Vice President's travel logs.
Everything in the past  years.
What are we looking for?
Anything that could hurt us.
I'll work forward.
You work backward.
I'm on it. And Doug?
Thanks.
Nancy, I need you to order me a new phone.
You said "Odds and ends." The "Home stretch."
I was presented with this information just hours ago.
We're talking about impeachable offenses, Frank.
Not at all, sir.
Your Chief of Staff was   
I had a gut feeling that the casino was involved.
I sent Doug down there to get to the bottom of it.
You should have taken this to the DOJ the first inkling you had   
That's exactly what I didn't want.
To create some ruckus if nothing was going on?
You can't go on conducting your own investigations, Frank.
Fact-finding, due diligence, whatever you want to call it.
If any laws were being broken, I wanted to know.
And that's what you want to tell Dunbar.
That I didn't want to disclose our diplomatic protocols.
That I was concerned about the midterms.
And that I wanted to protect the President of the United States.
Now, maybe what I did was wrong,
but I didn't do anything illegal.
You certain of that?
I've discussed this at length with my lawyers.
Dunbar does not strike me as the sort of person
who will put on the brakes, even if we admit all of this.
In fact, it might encourage her to dig deeper.
You're right.
Which is why I want to hand over all of my travel logs.
And I think you should, too.
Volunteer them?
Yeah. As a gesture of cooperation.
Haven't we made enough gestures?
That'll take the wind outta her sails.
No. I don't, uh, want her,
uh, poring over every one of my comings and goings.
He's worried about his marriage counseling,
as he should be.
If you're worried about your marriage counseling,
you shouldn't be.
Imagine the fallout if the public were to find out that   
A needle in a haystack,
and not a needle that Dunbar is looking for.
She's interviewed half of Congress.
That woman's after blood.
But not for gossip.
And even if she does raise an eyebrow,
you were visiting a sick friend, weren't you?
Yeah, ostensibly.
Well, she couldn't possibly find any fault with that.
I'd like Galich in here.
I'll let you two talk privately.
When are you seeing Dunbar?
Tomorrow, so you have some time.
Well, I'll speak to Bill and get back to you.
He'll advise you against it, which is his job.
But I would just encourage you to think politics and not legalese.
Thank you, sir.
Congresswoman?
Why should I vote for you?
It's    it's okay, Mark.
Goodnight.
You look tired.
Long day on the campaign trail?
What are you doing here?
You never told me about Havemeyer's daughter.
Everyone knows that.
The whole world knows.
But not that you visited her.
That you leaked it.
You came all the way to California to ask me about that?
I came to California to find out about that.
I offered to buy Havemeyer's house,
but he told me for nothing.
You were right.
It has been a long day on the trail.
It's still a close race.
But not if the voters know how you became whip.
Are you honestly threatening me?
Set up a meeting with Frank.
I don't care what you talk about,
long as you're alone and the meeting is on the books.
Then you're gonna sit down with Dunbar.
I've already done my interview.
Tell her Frank grilled you on your testimony.
Perjure myself?
Save your seat.
You know what? Tell everyone.
Think how that'd play out.
I don't care.
You'd really toss yourself off a cliff for Frank?
I have zero allegiance for Frank Underwood.
I won't be manipulated by him.
And I sure as fuck won't be manipulated by you.
I'm not bluffing.
Then I was right.
About what?
How little I meant.
That has nothing to do with this.
It has everything to do with this.
I should feel disgusted, but I don't.
Just supremely disappointed.
We got the call  minutes ago.
Direct from the White House counsel.
The President's turning over everything?
From the day he took office.
And we're sure this includes the visits to his friend?
It has to. It was full security detail.
Phenomenal.
We have something we can work with.
Now, as for my logs...
They're clean.
You'd bet your life on that?
I would.
Me, too, sir.
We've been through 'em twice, backward and forward.
My statement?
In your inbox.
I looked it over. Seth did a nice job.
We need to go wide with this the moment the interview's over,
so that we beat Dunbar to the punch
in case she decides to release something.
I'll be at my computer,
ready to press "Send" the moment I hear from Doug.
Have either of you slept?
We're awake. Fully operational.
You take a shower and put on a fresh suit.
Yes, sir. I'll see you over there.
You have at least three hours.
Take a nap. You can use my office.
General McGinnis was in the courtroom when you testified.
Yes.
Had you seen him in person   
I mean, since he assaulted you?
No.
So what was that like?
Not fun.
Not fun how?
It was hard. Really hard.
Look, Megan,
I    I agreed to change the focus of my piece to focus on you,
and, you know, I know this has gotta be hard.
I need you to help me out a little bit.
I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at this. I'm nervous.
You seemed fine when you called into Mrs. Underwood's interview.
She was there with me on the phone.
Your nerves.
I know that's been an issue since the assault.
The defense brought up
what they called emotional and mental instability.
That's what always happens.
The person who was attacked gets attacked all over again.
How did that make you feel?
It made me angry.
The lawyer kept coming after me about my panic attacks,
my antidepressants.
But I just kept staring at McGinnis.
I wanted him to see I could take it.
That I was strong.
I wanted to make him look away first.
And did he?
Yes. When I said he did more than violate my body.
He betrayed his country.
He robbed it of a good Marine.
Let's talk about the Sexual Assault Bill
that's in front of Congress right now.
You know it's taken some significant opposition,
most notably from another veteran,
Jacqueline Sharp.
If you ask me, she's betraying her country, too.
Ms. Dunbar.
Mr. Vice President.
Thank you for giving us a few extra days.
I have no problem being patient,
as long as it leads to forthright answers.
Well, I won't make you wait a moment longer.
Shall we?
Oh, you found it.
Have a seat.
We're just finishing up here.
What do you think, Mr. Tusk?
Keep growing it or have it shaved?
Ah, I guess I'll keep growing it.
Ah, no problem.
Let me just clean up the back here.
No, Mack, if you'd give me a couple of minutes.
Appreciate it.
I had this place built down here about  years ago.
I got tired of driving all the way across town every two weeks.
Now it's just an elevator ride.
Convenient.
You know what isn't convenient?
Cramming eight attorneys into my office.
It was not designed for the entire partnership of my law firm.
They're worried about Lanagin.
He's a little shaky, but he'll hold up.
Underwood?
Birch delivered.
And did Dunbar bring up Stamper?
The sessions are closed-door,
but I can't imagine she didn't.
And what about poor Havemeyer?
Was he any help to us on Jackie Sharp?
I do not take your hesitation as a promising sign.
I never like disappointing you.
He had nothing.
No.
Now, do you think that's because there's nothing here,
or because he's protecting her.
There's nothing there.
I can go to another congressman   
No, no, no.
It has to be somebody high-profile,
someone in the leadership who will make waves.
Let me get back to Birch.
Too obvious,
now that he's shown no sympathy for Frank.
This can't look orchestrated.
Multiple fronts, Remy.
Has to be Jackie Sharp.
Mack?
Let's finish up here.
I gotta get back to work.
You got it, boss.
You need to get back to work, too.
And what we discussed?
Make it happen.
You denied being a back channel.
I did not deny.
I chose not to confirm because it was classified.
But your office has consistently denied   
I instructed Doug to do so,
along with my communications department.
When a back channel becomes public,
it defeats its purpose.
An orchestrated deception   
If we had refused to comment,
it would have suggested that it was true,
which would have endangered the process.
I really had no choice.
Mr. Feng is currently in Dubai.
I know.
He's fleeing corruption charges.
Not the first time he's been accused.
And your question?
I know he laundered the money, Mr. Vice President.
It's just a matter of time
before I have the proof to substantiate that.
So my question, which I am asking again,
is whether you knew.
And I will repeat my answer.
I did not.
I did sense that something was awry,
and Doug was aware of my concerns.
And I took it upon myself to find out.
The vice president didn't know.
You had no knowledge he was going to the casino?
None. But that doesn't mean
I don't take full responsibility for my staff's behavior.
The buck stops with me.
And what did you find?
Nothing. No illegal activity.
I don't have the same resources that you do.
If you suspected,
why didn't you go immediately to the NIGC,
the BIA, the Department   
You have to understand.
We're facing very difficult midterms.
I didn't want to bring attention
to a series of allegations that may have no basis in fact.
Now, that may have been misguided logic,
but that's how I chose to act.
The mistake is mine and mine alone.
Not Doug's.
And certainly not the president's.
It shouldn't surprise you
if I say it feels like I am not getting the full picture.
Which is why I'm prepared to give you the full picture.
Oliver?
The White House believes in transparency.
All of the vice president's personal travel logs.
And the last  years since I became whip.
As well as the president's since inauguration.
There should be no doubt as to whom we met with and when.
I am skeptical about what this contains.
Which is what we anticipated
and why Oliver will walk you through anything
you might need to know.
It's all there.
But if you have any questions or requests,
we'll be happy to facilitate.
I mean, at first I was really nervous.
But then as soon as I started getting into it,
starting speaking from my heart,
all these things poured out.
Everything I wanted to say.
That I've been wanting to say.
Seth told me that Matt was very impressed.
I want to do more.
More interviews?
Articles. TV.
Whatever it takes.
I want to help.
That's great, Megan.
Thank you for making me do this.
It was a big step for me.
You have a plane to catch.
I can stay longer, if you need me to do another.
Why don't you head back to Chicago,
and as soon as we put a plan together
we can give you a buzz?
Can I get a glass of water?
Tap is fine, or you want bottled   
I can get it.
We've got Ms. Hennessey's car ready, ma'am.
Edward?
Did she seem all right
when you picked her up from the airport?
How do you mean?
I don't know. Normal.
Yes. I'd say so.
She's very up and down.
Very skittish and manic.
I guess she did seem nervous.
We didn't talk much.
I'll get her.
I'll be outside.
Megan?
I've got it.
Really.
I'm okay.
The car is ready whenever you are.
Thank you for everything.
Have a safe flight. I'll be in touch.
I just had a very productive interview with Ms. Dunbar.
Send out the press release.
Thank you very much.
You okay, ma'am?
Oh, I'm fine. I just dropped...
Please, let me.
Oh, uh, it's fine. I'm fine.
No, I've got it. You're barefoot.
Edward, you don't have to. Really.
Oh, no. What happened?
Damn it.
Let me get some bandages.
You don't have to.
No, I want to. Stay here.
The coverage has been mostly positive so far.
Dunbar's office?
All they've said is they look forward to reviewing the logs.
Any heat on Doug?
Some.
I'm getting a lot of requests for comments.
I acted on my own.
And I will fully cooperate with the Justice Department.
We can put that out?
Sir?
It might generate more interest.
On me. Not the vice president.
I can handle whatever comes my way.
Put it out.
I'll print you out the most recent clips, too, sir.
Should I find a way to tip off Dunbar?
Let nature take its course.
We got a hold of Remy.
He just got back to town.
Where is he?
I've arranged everything with your detail.
You've done good work, Doug.
Thank you, sir.
There. That's much better.
Thanks, ma'am.
I'm gonna get going.
I'm sorry I'm a little drunk.
It's your house. You do whatever you want.
You should have a glass of wine.
I appreciate that, ma'am, but   
You're off your shift, right?
I am. That's true.
Then I won't take no for an answer.
Uh, you shouldn't waste any of your good stuff on me.
I don't really know anything about wine.
Then how about bourbon?
I bet you like a little of that.
I definitely don't mind a bourbon from time to time.
Then bourbon it is.
You're a tough man to track down these days.
You got the watch.
"To improve is to change."
"To perfect is to change often."
What sort of change are you looking for?
Whichever leaves me options.
Trouble at Glendon Hill?
Paid leave till the investigation is over.
Well, at least you're being paid.
First step in terminating my partnership.
You know how things go.
No matter what happens,
there's a stain I can't wash out.
So you're looking for career opportunities.
I'm not offering myself to you wholesale.
I keep fighting you, but I can fight you less.
And by "less" you mean...
Enough to hurt, but not finish you.
And in return I have a future beyond Glendon Hill,
whatever that might look like.
So you offer neutrality,
but you'll go with the victor.
I figure let the best man win.
And if you go down,
it won't be because of me.
That's worth something.
Where is this coming from?
Insurance. That's all.
Does it have anything to do with Jackie?
That's over.
I know you've got Birch in your pocket.
Womack's not an option. We're too close.
But Jacqueline...
This is about my future, pure and simple.
She's not a part of it.
Keep the watch, as a token of good faith.
He might deny it, but he's protecting her.
What he doesn't realize is
I have even less regard for Jackie than Raymond does.
Poor Remy.
The heart can choke the mind
when all its blood flows back unto itself.
He said, "I don't like brunettes."
Looks like I almost missed the party.
I'm off the clock, sir.
Oh, relax. Francis, I broke a glass,
and Edward cut his hand on a piece of it.
Jesus.
I have to change that.
Take that off, and I'll get fresh...
I hope you don't mind, sir.
I was off-duty   
Is she, uh...
Drunk? A little.
How many of these have you had?
A few.
More than a few.
May I?
Please.
Let me see.
Oh, it's not too bad.
There's a lot of blood.
Looks worse than it is.
Is it painful?
The bourbon helps.
Now you let me know if this hurts.
Not one bit, sir.
How's your head?
Fine.
Took a few aspirin before I went to sleep.
You?
I slept like a baby.
Good. You needed that.
What is it?
Something weird.
This one address keeps popping up.
Underwood?
The president.
Morning, Meechum.
Morning, Mr. Vice President.
It's a beautiful day.House.of.Cards.SE
You're parsing the law.
And I'm talking about a spiritual code.
Confidentiality is a covenant.
Not only between myself and those I counsel,
but also between myself and the Lord.
Dr. Larkin, my chief focus here is the money laundering.
If the President brought up Xander Feng,
Raymond Tusk, the Adohi Casino  
It doesn't matter what the focus is.
I can't share anything we discussed privately.
Religious guidance is protected.
But you were also conducting professional therapy.
I never claimed that.
Mr. And Mrs. Keith confirmed as much.
We were at their house.
But they didn't participate in any of our conversations.
So how would they know?
So you're saying you only gave religious counsel?
That's how I choose to interpret it.
The President and his wife have never once attended your church.
They're not even the same denomination.
Irrelevant.
Not legally speaking.
I'm certain I can convince a judge to issue a subpoena
on the grounds that you weren't their legitimate spiritual advisor.
Which is your prerogative.
But I can appeal. And I would.
You'd lose.
The only circumstance by which I would talk
is if someone personally waived their privilege.
Otherwise I'd rather face contempt of court.
It's a matter of ethics.
Mr. President. Ah, you brought it back in.
Floyd Mayweather visited the White House this morning.
I thought he'd get a kick out of it.
Did he have a go at it?
He threw a combination I thought would bust the stitching loose.
Well, that must have been a treat to watch.
He was telling me it's not just about the power.
Plenty of boxers are more powerful than he is.
No, it's his tactics, his precision, his speed.
Most important? His counter punch.
He dances and dodges and then picks the perfect moment to strike.
Does that sound familiar?
How do you mean, sir?
You gave this to me as a gesture of friendship.
When I look at this now, I don't see friendship.
I see calculation.
You set me up, Frank.
What?
Your back channeling. The special prosecutor.
When I think about Raymond, about Linda, about Jim Matthews...
You are wrong, sir.
Questions from Dunbar about the marriage counseling.
"It's a needle in the haystack she's not trying to find."
That's what you said. Well, she found the needle.
I am shocked, sir. I    I never   
Like hell you are. You want to deminish me.
Diminish you?
Laying the groundwork for a challenge in .
I am sorry to have to say this, sir, but you are being ludicrous.
Do you really think I'm so blind?
A vice president has never challenged a sitting president.
You've climbed the ladder doing things other men would never do.
Always in service to you and the party.
It was you idea to hand over those logs.
You connected the White House to China, the casino   
Raymond Tusk entangled us with China and the casino.
And if I hadn't intervened   
You can't dodge and duck like Floyd. I've learned your moves now.
This office breeds paranoia. Don't give into it, sir.
I'd ask for your resignation if it wouldn't make things worse.
But from this moment forward, I don't want to hear your voice,
I don't want to see your face.
And if I do, I will put you on your god damn back.
Exile. I've managed to isolate the president from everyone.
Including myself.
"Congresswoman Sharp is a perfect example
of how the military brainwashes us
into never questioning the party line.
Her opposition to the bill is disgraceful.
It will cost thousands of men and women
 the justice they deserve,
and some of them their lives."
Those are Megan Hennessey's words. They're biased.
They're Claire's words. Hennessey's just the mouthpiece.
Why does it say here that I declined to comment?
You said you didn't want to kick up dust if we could avoid it.
It's the New York fucking Times. You should've let me know.
That was my call. I'll take the blame.
Find out when Hennessey's next appearance is.
I'm gonna beat this bitch down.
I know she went after you, but going after her is   
Not her. Claire Underwood.
I understand how Garrett might misconstrue things,
given the pressure he's under.
But you can't honestly believe it yourself.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Francis is devastated. All he wants to do is help,
but he feels like he's being unfairly accused.
I don't want to believe it, Claire, but Garrett is convinced.
Will you talk to him?
I have to concentrate on keeping my family together right now.
Not getting into arguments over   
If Francis were really up to something,
don't you think he would have told Dunbar about the therapy?
He basically did by forcing us to hand over the logs.
Your husband chose to hand them over.
If he'd said no, Francis wouldn't have pressed the issue.
I don't want to debate this with you, Claire.
All I'm asking is that you really think this through, Tricia.
Is he with you right now?
Who?
Frank.
No. It's just you and me.
I want to get off the phone.
Will you please talk to Garrett?
Goodbye, Claire.
What do you think?
I don't think she's going to side with me instead of her husband.
Did Tricia tell anyone else about the Xanax besides you?,
I doubt she would. She's very sensitive about it.
If she'd only told someone else, then we could just leak it.
But it'll be too obvious.
The doctor.
He's protecting them. He won't say anything.
Unless they waive the privilege.
They have absolutely nothing to gain by that.
But we do.
You have to meet with Tusk.
Why would he talk to me after I back-stabbed him?
That's precisely why he'll talk to you.
Well, I can't go to St. Louis. You know   
Tusk will come east. Your job is to get in the same room with him.
  What's the play?   Remy Danton.
Go. Get me Durant, in person.
I'll set it up.
And Doug? Let's make sure we're airtight on everything else.
No Achilles heel.
Yes, sir.
"Cry, 'Havoc,'" Said he who fought chaos with chaos,
"And let slip the dogs of war."
Missed appointments. No contact in weeks. You know the rules.
I'd like to speak to Agent Green, please.
What are you up to?
Put Green on the fucking line, please.
Anything you have to say, you can discuss it with me.
What I have to say is way above your pay grade.
Where do I turn off this shit?
Look at the other screen, to the left.
What is this?
That is the access grid to all eight of AT T's data centers.
So what do you say you un-cuff me
and tell Agent Green I'll be waiting for his call?
I'm trying to repair relations with China.
Giving Feng asylum would be a slap in the face.
Garrett's in trouble. He needs to appear resolute.
We're only as strong as the president we serve.
We have to rescue him.
How can you be sure his testimony won't implicate the White House?
He knows where his bread is buttered.
This isn't about you saving the president.
  Of course it is.   We've been down this road before, Frank.
Michael Kern, Adam Galloway.
I wanted to become secretary of state
in order to engage in productive diplomacy,
not full-time damage control.
Which is why we have to put Garrett back on his feet.
You want him on his ass, Frank.
Is this what the president told you?
He's paranoid, Cathy.
He's trying to turn people against me.
You're turning them against yourself.
You're asking me to undermine the president.
All right.
Let's say that what the President has accused me of is true.
Would that be so bad?
If taken to its conclusion?
Wouldn't you stand to benefit?
Wouldn't the country?
I don't want anything to do with this.
Just one more time, Cathy.
Let's unshackle ourselves.
This is a one-time offer, Mr. Feng.
I would need it in writing. Open-ended, no restrictions.
The same goes for legal immunity.
First I need to know whether or not
you funneled money through Lanagin's casino.
No, no. I will speak freely once I've arrived safely
in the United States.
Unless you provide valuable evidence now,
the attorney general will not grant immunity on any level.
I've denied these allegations in China.
My enemies want me dead.
You're asking me to give them confirmation.
And we're giving you safe haven in return.
I already have safe haven in Dubai.
Your asylum there is only temporary.
We're offering you permanent status.
I'm confident that they will grant me permanent status.
Did you hear that directly from the Minister of Foreign Affairs?
Because I just spoke to him.
Right now you are a man without a passport.
Whatever assets Beijing hasn't seized
are frozen in every country with close ties to the United Sates or China,
which is just about every country in the world.
You want your freedom and fortune. We want information.
Mr. Feng?
What do you need to know?
Confirm for me the existence of a money-laundering scheme.
Yes. We used the casino to mask foreign contributions.
All right.
One of you want to tell me what this is all about?
You have to comply.
You mean I have to show up.
Unless we appeal.
We'd lose.
She wouldn't have issued the subpoena
unless she had something substantial.
I agree.
Which is why I think you should go
and plead the Fifth.
What do you think she has?
I don't want to speculate.
God damn it, I pay the six of you more in one day
than it costs to put a kid through college.
And I pay you to know more than I do.
Her line of questioning will tell us a lot.
We can use that to prepare our defense in case there's an indictment.
When do I have to go?
Your interview is the day after next.
Having trouble starting it?
Yeah. I think the battery might be dead.
I have some cables if you want to try and jump it.
You sure you don't mind?
Not at all.
All right. It's really nice of you.
Pop your hood. I'll bring my car around.
Sure.
This is Peter. He's the guy who drove me back.
Where do you want these?
I'll take 'em. Thanks.
Rachel, right?
Yeah.
Lisa said you two were roommates.
Can I get you something? A glass of water?
No, thanks. I should really get going.
All right. I can't thank you enough.
My pleasure. Good luck with the car.
Thanks.
I hope it's only a dead battery. Have a good night.
We should give him some money.
Peter.
She needs to be gone.
Y   you told me she could stay.
I changed my mind.
But you said you didn't care if she was here   
I don't need to explain myself.
You can't stand it, can you?
The idea that I might actually love somebody.
That I might have somebody in my life who isn't you.
If you care about her, make it happen, Rachel.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. You need to tell your friend that I won't take any money.
I was happy to do it.
We all need a good Samaritan every now and again.
Did you feel justice was served
when General McGinnis got sentenced to  years?
Yes, as far as his crimes go.
But not for thousands of servicemen and   
I'm    I'm sor   I'm sorry to interrupt.
m   my producer is telling me that,
Jacqueline Sharp has called in,
the house majority whip. C   congresswoman, are you there?
Yes, I'm here, Chris. And thank you for taking my call.
Thank you.
Hello, Megan.
Congresswoman.
First of all, as a veteran like yourself,
I want to thank you for your service to our country.
Duty doesn't require thanks.
I'm glad you brought up duty,
because you recently equated it with brainwashing.
That's not what I meant.
You said "Toeing the party line."
What I meant was that the culture and the system is one that   
I didn't call to argue with you, Megan. The opposite.
We can't fix this problem until we find some common ground.
Wouldn't you agree?
There is no middle ground as far as I'm concerned.
The military needs to change   
Can't we agree that you and I served
so that we could protect open debate,
which is the very bedrock of democracy?
Yes, in theory, but that's not what I'm talking about.
Not in theory. In reality.
Brave men and women die fighting for that freedom.
The meaning of bravery is fighting for the freedom
of those with whom you disagree.
Sure, but let's get back to the issue here.
What I don't think is brave is Claire Underwood
dodging this debate and having you fight this battle for her instead.
That's not true.
Then why am I talking to you instead of her? It's her bill.
It's not just hers. It's all of ours.
Except one of you is brave enough to say it,
and the other is a coward.
Mrs. Underwood was brave enough
to go on national television and admit that she   
Yeah, and where has she been since then?
Deflecting scandal and hiding from the press.
You called me disgraceful in The New York Times, Megan,
and you have every right.
But I also have the right to say that Mrs. Underwood is disgraceful,
because there is nothing
more disgraceful than running from a battle.
  Megan?   That is    we're not even...
We'll be right back.
Where are you going?
To the Capitol.
Did Feng mention either me or the president?
Dunbar wouldn't say.
But the fact that Feng confirmed the money laundering
increases focus on the White House.
Well, as long as we're innocent, which we are.
Raymond Tusk has been subpoenaed.
Why did you ask for this meeting, Bill?
Just keeping us in the loop?
Did you encourage Secretary Durant to offer Feng asylum?
Bill, for god sakes.
The president could have asked me that question himself.
As the White House counsel, it is my responsibility   
No, I did not.
So you're saying Durant acted of her own accord.
I have no idea what her motivations were.
I'm just as shocked as the president
that she would have gone through with this without his direct approval.
There's another matter I'd like to discuss.
Privately, if we could.
Just give us a few moments.
  The therapy.  Yes.
To be specific, the confidentiality waiver.
Feng's testimony puts us in a very awkward position.
We're under a great deal of pressure to waive the privilege.
If we don't, it implies that the president
may have confessed to things he didn't.
Dunbar is just grasping. Don't give in.
I don't want to.
But Larkin's argument for spiritual confidentiality is shaky at best.
We want to control how this thing plays out.
How can I help?
We need to know if anyone else might pop out of the woodwork.
Well, I haven't mentioned it to anyone, and neither has Claire.
I would never betray the president's trust like that.
Thank you for your time.
Tell the president it saddens me that
we now have to communicate through lawyers.
I will make myself available if he wants
to discuss any of this in person.
Yes, sir.
What Megan said was offensive.
She shouldn't have questioned your character.
Those were talking points. Carefully crafted, and not by her.
I'm not here to pick a fight, Jackie. I'm here to end one.
Well, it'll end soon enough when the bill goes to the floor.
It won't go to the floor.
I've spoken to Elaine Brooks and I'm withdrawing the bill.
What you said had some truth.
And early on you offered
to sit down with me and find a middle ground.
I decided to draw a line in the sand.
And the braver thing would've been for me
to swallow my pride and sit down with you.
If you're still open to that, I'd love to start over.
Are you and Frank up to something?
A passable bill.
He had Nancy spy on me. He brought my personal life into   
Francis is used to getting his way.
And he'll do anything to make sure he does,
especially if it's something important to me.
I don't know, Claire. I'm skeptical.
We're deeply sorry for the way we've treated you
and we want to rebuild the trust we've lost.
Do you think that's possible?
I'm sorry to ambush you. I tried calling.
You can't do this to me, Claire.
I was very clear that I have to respect Garrett's wishes   
Not that. The sexual assault bill.
It's not going to a vote.
Did the speaker remove it from the docket?
No. I did. I just spoke to Jackie.
This is because of what she said about you?
My main concern is that she doesn't come after you next.
Not while you and Garrett are going through the investigation.
I thought you should be aware
because I know how much this bill meant to you.
All the work you've put in.
That we've put in.
But we'll pass Jackie's version,
take this baby step, and build on it.
I'm disappointed about the bill,
but I have to say, I'm relieved.
How are you holding up?
Did you hear what Catherine did? Giving Feng asylum?
Inexcusable.
Garrett's beside himself. He feels cornered,
like we have no choice but to waive the privileges now.
But what about the medication?
I know.
I shouldn't be sharing this.
We don't have to talk about it. You should go.
I know you have a packed schedule.
Thank you for doing this.
All I had to do was get her alone in a hallway.
I meant with Jackie.
We have our priorities.
Well, I know it isn't easy to let go of something like that.
Promise me something.
Anything.
I can't live in this house alone.
I'm not going anywhere.
You say that, but this could all backfire.
Raymond will plead the Fifth.
If he names me, it's an admission of his own wrongdoing.
I'm more worried about Garrett.
You've made a powerful enemy.
We're stronger than they are.
And he's still the president.
I promise you, of all of the sacrifices that you've had to make,
divorcing a convict will not be one of them.
We can't waive the privileges, Garrett.
Well, we don't have a choice anymore. Feng confirmed the money.
Over the phone. Not in a formal interview.
Rescind the asylum. Send him back   
Obstruction of justice.
Is that what Galich said?
Definitely how it would be perceived.
And anything we do that looks like a failure to cooperate
amplifies that perception.
I just don't want our marriage put on display.
Look, Dunbar'll ask if I brought up China. I didn't.
So Larkin can only help to exonerate me.
And if the marriage counseling ends up in the report, so be it.
We can survive that.
But he prescribed us medication.
Technically not us.
You took mine, Garrett.
Larkin wrote the prescription to me knowing you would.
Wait, wait, have you mentioned it? The medication?
Claire?
I'm sorry. But she's the only person I can talk to
who really understands what it's like   
Oh, all the more reason we have to waive the privilege.
If they leak this, we can't control the information.
Claire wouldn't do that.
Don't underestimate her.
If they were going to, don't you think they would have done it by now?
She dropped the sexual assault bill to reduce pressure on us.
That may have been what she told you.
They're not going to say anything.
I'm begging you, Garrett.
Don't waive the privilege.
The things we talked about were so intimate.
Imagine if the kids   
I know. But Tricia   
When we ran,
I knew every aspect of our lives would be under scrutiny.
But I thought we could protect at least this.
What happens in here.
I'll protect us. Whatever I have to do.
You have to believe that.
We checked the USB dongle.
The code you're claiming infected the data center isn't there.
I programmed the code to self-erase as soon as it hit the server.
It was gone before Lucas was in cuffs.
You don't believe me?
This is one of the most sophisticated firewalls in the world.
Even if your code did get in there, you couldn't break it down.
Your wife uses AT T.
So does her lover.
What?
She's over there right now. Jonathan Kemp.
It's her chiropractor, right?
Want to see their texts to each other?
No.
Oh, I see you already know.
I don't blame you for not making a fuss,
what with the kids still at home.
But you walked my code right through that door.
Into  million people's phones.
And that's on you.
And it's on the FBI. And it is a shit-storm
that will bring the Bureau right in front of Congress.
How much is making that disappear worth?
You have a hundred years hanging over your head.
Extorting the FBI won't help you.
Did Douglas Stamper tell you to set up Lucas Goodwin?
Counter-Terrorism Director.
That's a big step up from White House Liaison.
  I think you had a helping hand.   Not true.
Keep lying. Meanwhile, here's what I want.
One, I'm no longer your bitch.
Two, all of my charges are dropped.
Three, all of Barrett Brown's charges are dropped.
That's up to the U.S. Attorney.
Figure it out.
If I'm hearing you correctly,
you'd like to keep Larkin's testimony focused on the money laundering.
Which I never brought up, because I knew nothing about it.
But your concern is other matters. Private matters.
Which are irrelevant to the investigation.
I can't prevent Dunbar from asking what she's gonna ask.
Of course not.
The most I can do is ask Dr. Larkin
how he would respond to certain questions.
But he's a smart man. He'll understand what I'm getting at.
And this approach keeps us within the law?
We're not tampering with testimony?
It's a fine line. But I'll stay on the right side of it.
He shut me out, Frank. Just like he did with you.
My undersecretary has been assigned full diplomatic authority.
A temporary setback, Cathy. Where I go, you go.
At this very moment, the President is in the Situation Room.
China responded to Feng's asylum exactly the way I predicted.
They're doubling their naval presence off the coast of Yonaguni.
And you know who isn't in the Situation Room? You and I, Frank.
You're thinking about where we are
instead of where we're headed.
Now that isn't the Catherine Durant
that I waltzed with at the Jefferson Ball.
She understood potential.
She had her eyes toward the future.
I told that Catherine Durant
that we needed her in the State Department.
We still need her. I wish I knew where she was,
because she is not the Catherine Durant
sitting in front of me right now.
But I'll tell you something,
If she doesn't show up soon, well,
I'm just gonna have to keep waltzing alone.
Because I am done trying to convince this woman in front of me
to take my arm.
Oh, don't let me keep you.
I'm here. I'm not going anywhere, Frank.
You still have access to the presidential briefing?
Yes, I have it right here.
Walk me through everything that's going on with China.
Feng is in play now. We might be able to use him.
How?
I don't know yet.
But he's clearly valuable to Beijing,
which makes him valuable to us.
Nothing about Xander Feng?
Never.
Daniel Lanagin? Raymond Tusk?
We only discussed their marriage.
Nothing about the business of the White House.
Any oblique reference to work-related pressures he was feeling?
He said he wasn't getting as much sleep as he'd like.
Did you ever prescribe him any medication?
As I've always stated, I provided religious counsel.
I understand. But I'm asking about medication.
How is this relevant?
I'm trying to assess whether his judgment may have been impaired.
In my opinion, he and his wife were
dealing with standard marital issues.
That's not what I asked, Dr. Larkin.
So I will ask for a third time.
And let me be more specific.
Was any medication prescribed or taken as a result of your
counseling session by the President of the United States?
His faculties were operating at a hundred percent,
if that's what you're asking.
Has anyone from the administration spoken to you?
How do you mean?
About this deposition. Has anyone approached you, coached you?
If you tell me now, I will qualify that as a timely declaration.
  I'd like to leave.   The President waived his privilege.
But I'm here voluntarily.
Dr. Larkin, at first you wouldn't talk to me
because it violated your ethical code.
I respect that.
But let me ask you, as a man of faith
is deliberately lying to me an exception to that code?
Because that is what you're doing by refusing to share the truth.
I don't understand.
It wasn't going to pass.
But you said we almost had the votes.
We needed to be a hundred percent solid, and we weren't.
If the bill failed, that would set us back.
We need to accept incremental reform.
You sound just like Jackie Sharp.
I'm actually working with her now.
She's a powerful ally for us to have.
After what she did to me?
After what she said about you?
If I let the things people say about me get under my skin,
I wouldn't be able to leave my own home.
You know how this will go.
Everyone will say, "Great, we did something,"
Which is really nothing.
They'll pat themselves on the back and they'll forget about it.
We helped put this on the radar.
I thought we were doing something real.
Changing people's lives. How naive, right?
But at least I didn't want to give up.
Maybe Jackie Sharp is right.
You are a fucking coward.
I'm the one that pulled you out from under the covers.
You were hiding. You and your pills.
So you tell yourself whatever you need to.
I'm sorry.
There were political realities we couldn't ignore.
Do you ever wonder why so many people hate Washington?
It's because of people like you using phrases like that.
Raymond?
I'd turn the lights on, but when you're paying for the room
with the best view you might as well make the most of it.
I've never been in the penthouse here. Have you?
What's going on?
Do you know why I'm in D.C.?
Oh, it's okay, Remy.
There's nothing you can say that I don't already know.
Feng is on his way to testify.
Whatever Seth has told you, don't believe a word of it.
What might he have told me that I shouldn't believe?
You met with the Vice President.
In a church. Don't pretend you didn't.
Playing both sides?
Raymond, look   
I want to hear you say it. That you met with Frank.
I'll talk to you, Raymond, but not with him here.
Leave us.
Should I hold the elevator for you?
Go fuck yourself.
Okay. You can take the stairs.
They're toying with you, Raymond.
No doubt. But so are you, Remy.
I wanted to lead Frank on, give him a false sense of security.
If you're gonna lie, lie better than that.
They want to tear us apart.
I don't blame you for wanting to keep your options open.
But clearly you have bought the wrong insurance policy.
Don't shoot yourself in the foot like this.
Your foot. And you're holding the gun.
Now go someplace else to bleed.
You want to talk about blood?
How much have you spilt in this war with Frank?
All I've tried to do is keep the peace.
You could've let him have the upper hand.
What would that have really cost you, other than your pride?
Such a shame.
You have just made  billion enemies, Remy.
And some change.
Your market cap is shrinking.
White House Counsel Bill Galich was called into questioning this morning
by Special Prosecutor Heather Dunbar.
According to Dunbar's office,
there are suspicions that
Galich may have tampered with witness testimony.
The witness in question is Dr. Thomas Larkin,
a reverend and therapist
who allegedly conducted secret marriage counseling sessions
for the president and first lady.
The White House counsel wouldn't be manipulating testimony
without explicit direction from the Oval Office.
And just as disconcerting is the fact that
our president is seeking psychological treatment
and chose to hide this from the American people.
If we can't trust him about that,
then how do we know he wasn't involved in a money-laundering scheme?
How do we know he's mentally fit to lead?
And most important,
how can he enforce the law when he's breaking it?
I believe our colleagues in the House
certainly have enough to consider Articles of Impeachment.
Both trust and laws have been broken.
Whatever the House decides to do,
we must hold this president accountable.
Fully support the president
and will stand by him no matter what comes his way.
Put that in, put it out. Then get me Ayla Sayyad.
And as for Remy, let's let him wither on the vine a little longer.
In the meantime, have his better half come by the house tomorrow.
Raymond?
No. Jackie.
Mr. Tusk.
Well, Ms. Dunbar, in  years on this planet
I have never once been issued a subpoena.
I can now cross that off my bucket list.
This interview is being recorded and sealed.
As the subpoena mentioned, Mr. Tusk, I spoke with Xander Feng.
He verified that you were his partner
in laundering Chinese money to political Super PACs since .
How would you respond to his allegations?
My client exercises his right to plead the Fifth Amendment.
Did you ever use these contributions to bargain for political favors?
My client exercises his right to plead the Fifth Amendment.
What was your relationship with Daniel Lanagin?
My client exercises his right to plead the Fifth Amendment.
I don't even remember why I came over here.
You mean when you first showed up?
No. To the kitchen.
I'm sorry. Please don't think that I don't love you   
Then why? I don't get it.
Everything's been so fast.
And...
I don't know. It's hard to explain, but I'm not ready for this.
  That's bullshit.   No, it's not.
I'm still trying to figure out this new life.
And this is too confusing.
This is the only thing that's clear, and you know it.
You're afraid, but it's good to be afraid when you're  
I need you to leave, okay? For your own good.
I am just gonna hurt you.
I have thicker skin than you can even imagine.
Please don't make this harder than it has to be.
Everything was fine yesterday. It's so sudden.
It's like it's coming out of nowhere.
Well, it's not. I've been thinking about it for a while.
No, you haven't. I would have sensed it.
Would you please, please, please just go?
Just tell me what's going on.
I don't expect you to understand.
Well, maybe if you try   
I don't want you here. Okay?
I don't love you the way that you love me.
I was using you because it felt good to have you around,
but it was selfish.
I said the words because I knew you wanted to hear 'em,
but I didn't mean 'em.
And I don't want to keep saying 'em.
I'm gonna go for a walk while you pack your stuff.
No. I don't want anything that's been here.
Lisa...?
"There was a steaming mist in all the hollows,
and it roamed in its forlornness up the hill,
like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none.
A clammy, and intensely cold mist,
it made it its slow way through the air in ripples
that visibly followed and overspread one another,
as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do.
It was dense enough to shut out everything
from the light of the coach lamps."
I'm surprised you wanted to speak to me.
I haven't been the biggest friend of the administration.
Isn't that the very best reason to speak with you?
I'd like to begin recording.
By all means.
A number of political analysts predict
that the House Judiciary Committee
will commence with hearings on Articles of Impeachment.
Let's just stop right there.
So these analysts you speak of,
they're making predictions prior to Dunbar's report even being released.
That could take months.
There's no way the Judiciary will sit on this for that long.
And isn't that the fundamental flaw with these hearings?
The committee feels compelled to act because of hypotheses
advanced by those in the media, such as yourself.
I can't speak for all of my colleagues, but I'm just reporting facts.
Well, you may call them facts, but if we're being honest,
  aren't they just      In every article and interview,
I report alleged activities.
And if you repeat allegations enough,
again and over and over and over,
people start to believe that they're true. That's human nature.
I've done my research.
Xander Feng admitted to the money laundering.
But you're no longer writing about Xander Feng. Are you?
You're writing about the administration.
The truth is, these hearings have been initiated by the press.
And my fear is that the president will be tried by the press.
Do you believe he's innocent?
Absolutely.
I said so in my written statement and I say so again now.
The White House counsel has denied coaching Dr. Larkin,
  but according to Ms.      Whatever comes to light,
it will only prove the president's innocence.
And I'll tell you why. I have never known anyone more honest,
ethical, and patriotic than Garrett Walker.
His reverence for the Constitution and the laws of this country
are surpassed by none.
Tricia and I have been blessed with a strong and loving marriage.
But even strong marriages face challenges.
Like millions of Americans,
we sought counseling from a spiritual advisor,
one who happened also to be a professional therapist.
Over the years we have often
turned to our faith in times of adversity.
Many have criticized us.
But would you rather have a president that doesn't ask for help?
I ask for help from my wife every day.
We've relied on one another for  years.
We've raised two beautiful children together.
Endured the campaign trails together.
From the state capital in Denver
to the nation's capital,
we've always been at each other's side.
I married this man for the
same reason that so many of you voted for him.
Because he's a man of God. Because he believes in family.
Because he is compassionate and loving.
Now, none of us are perfect.
I'm not. Tricia's not.
Although she certainly comes close.
Good morning, Mr. Feng.
I won't ignore what makes me human.
That's a form of blindness.
Good leadership means tackling my imperfections head on.
Not bad for a man on the run.
You mean a man with immunity.
Wherever you're most comfortable.
We have a lot to discuss.
I do so with open eyes.
Just as I love, with open eyes,
my wife, my maker,
and my country.
Come in.
Thank you, Meechum.
Jackie, in these circumstances normally I would come to you,
but we need to keep a public distance for the time being.
I thought I was here to discuss the sexual assault bill.
  You are.   Among other things.
I see.
There's a price.
Well, we don't think of it that way.
I'm going to support your bill, no matter what you say today.
Regarding?
Impeachment.
Well, if it goes to the Judiciary   
It most definitely will.
I'm not sure about that.
Did you see the president's address?
We did.
I think it will help. Stop the bleeding.
Impeachment can be defeated.
But that's we need to avoid.
You want impeachment...
Why fight a losing battle?
We have a majority in the House.
We do now.
But if this party fails to distance itself from a toxic president...
We're thinking ahead here.
It's why I came to you about the bill.
Because it wasn't worth burning a bridge over.
In the long run we have a lot more to gain by working together.
I don't understand.
You said in the Telegraph article that you would sta  
I had to.
My office is three doors down from the president's.
I can't publicly deride him.
You want me to do it?
whip the votes.
I can't abandon the president.
If the party rescues him,
we'll lose  seats in the House in the midterms.
You will lose your position in the leadership.
And it will take us a decade
to regain the trust of the electorate.
All we're asking is that you have an open mind.
Claire kept an open mind,
and you'll pass sexual assault reform as a result.
You can't possibly compare impeachment to   
It's an illustration, Jackie.
Of what the future looks like.
What we offer is progress.
With a promise of more to come.
It's only the beginning, Jackie.
Ruthless pragmatism, remember?
That's why I wanted you to be the whip.
The three of us, we're cut from the same cloth.
Mr. Vice President,
what you're asking is just shy of treason.
Just shy. Which is politics.
Be careful. It's delicate.
What is it?
Something I've been working on for a very long time.
And it's nearly finished.
Jackie?
Help us finish it.House.of.Cards.SE
We have a president who not only took mind-altering medication   
a man who has his finger on the button
while U.S. Ships are squaring off with China   
but then instructed his White House counsel to coach a   
Allegedly, sir. Not proven.
To coach a witness. Which is behavior either resulting
from the use of those drugs, or worse,
a deliberate attempt to obstruct the law.
Now wouldn't you call either scenario impeachable?
That's for the United States Congress to decide, sir. Not me.
Were you aware that the president was taking any form of medication?
No, I was not.
Did you notice him acting in a bizarre fashion?
  Unstable, incoherent?   No, sir.
  Any odd behavior?   No, sir.
Not even firing his chief of staff in the midst of a trade war?
He didn't fire me. I resigned.
Would you tell us why?
I resigned because I felt I could no longer
serve the president to the best of my ability.
And what changed? How did you come to that conclusion?
I had some fundamental differences of opinion
with certain people in the White House.
Like who? The president?
No, sir.
Well, what certain people then?
One person, actually.
The vice president, Frank Underwood.
He wanted you gone?
I can't speak as to what the vice president did or didn't want.
Was he trying to hide anything?
Was he afraid you might expose something?
You'd have to ask him, sir.
What's happening in the Judiciary Committee is a farce.
The Republicans are exploiting the situ  
Excuse me, Mr. Vice President,
but it's not just Republicans.
A number of Democrats have come out saying
they would support impeachment.
Including the Majority Whip, Jackie Sharp.
Which is egregious,
since the committee hasn't stopped hearing testimony,
and nor has the special prosecutor completed her investigation.
You vigorously defend the president,
but there are reports that you've had a falling out.
That you haven't spoken in weeks.
That is simply not true.
I've spoken to senior staff at the White House
who say the president is worried you want to run against him in .
And just today Linda Vasquez intimated that you   
Look, I fully expect that the president will run in ,
and I hope he's generous enough to invite me
to be his running mate.
Impeachment, conviction. Let's say it happens.
It won't. He's completely innocent.
Let's say it does happen. You become president.
That is not a scenario I'm going to entertain.
But the thought must have crossed your mind.
And one could make the argument that the president
wouldn't be in this predicament if it weren't for you.
It's your staff's involvement with Feng and Lanagin
that expanded Dunbar's investigation,
  which resulted in the travel logs   Look, these impeachment hearings
are the result of political maneuvering,
  not the fact that     Your maneuverings, or the Republicans?
Morley, I've always liked you. You ask the tough questions.
And you can certainly question my judgment.
But do not question my patriotism.
I serve this nation and my president, not myself.
He's lying through his teeth.
What we're doing is working.
We keep the whisper campaign alive.
We spin him as power-hungry, as duplicitous.
Focus attention on him. Not you.
What's the latest?  ?
Zogby has you at . Your speech made a difference.
The approval numbers are moving in the right direction.
We need to do more than play the spin game.
We need to destroy Frank. Offer his head instead of mine.
  We use Raymond Tusk.   How?
At his hearing. When he goes to the Judiciary.
Sir, you're already being accused of coaching one witness.
If you take steps to coach anoth  
Not coaching. The truth.
Raymond admits to the money laundering,
puts Frank at the center of this, and says I knew nothing.
And then we'll reward him for his honesty.
You mean a pardon.
I want you to talk to him.
And put myself at risk?
Well, you're not part of this administration anymore.
There's no law that says you can't pay Raymond Tusk a visit.
And in return, resignations don't have to last forever, Linda.
If I do this, you have to be a million miles away.
Tricia and I'll go to Camp David.
It's not a million miles away, but it'll do the job.
I can go after Linda. Dig into her past   
Neutralizing her won't neutralize the bigger problem.
It's the president that's after blood.
Then what's his move?
He can't ask me to resign. He'd have to force me out.
And to do that, if I were him,
I would return to the hand that first fed me.
  Raymond Tusk?   Exactly.
No, he'd have to implicate himself to implicate you.
Not if he gets a pardon.
It's the one thing that only a president can offer.
Tusk is a hand grenade. If he pardons him   
You're right. Tusk is a hand grenade,
and we need to pull the pin and throw him at Walker
before Walker pulls the pin and throws him at us.
I want to meet with Raymond, one on one.
Let me speak on your behalf.
  That way if anyone finds     I know Raymond.
He won't respond to anyone but me.
When's his hearing scheduled?
Uh, day after tomorrow. Two p.m.
  That gives us  hours to make it happen.   Yes, sir.
I think it's mine.
Seth, it's four in the morning.
When?
I want you to go with her.
  I'll get it cleared with Rockland right now.  Thank you.
Meechum says the plane will be ready in  minutes.
Okay, good.
You think it was just a panic attack
  or was she really trying     I don't know.
It was bad enough they felt they had to keep her overnight.
I'm gonna call the White House physician's office,
  see if they can recommend anyone.   Okay.
  Oh, wait. My phone.   It's in your hand.
I'll be back sometime tonight.
Impeachment is our only chance.
Here are the seats that are still in contention in the midterms.
These  we're gonna lose no matter what we do.
But even if we win all the rest,
that only leaves us with a five-seat majority.
We either save the party or we save the president.
Anyone who votes against impeachment
is gonna get pommeled by attack ads between now and election day.
How many do you have already?
We need . I have six.
So,  more to go.
Look, Donald, I know this is a big ask
and you prefer to focus on policy and not   
Jackie, you can stop. I'm on board.
  Really?    .
I have to say I'm a little surprised.
When you rolled those dollies into the cloakroom you said,
"Work with me. I'm not Frank Underwood."
And then you helped get my stimulus package through,
just like you promised.
And what do you expect this time?
That you never become Frank Underwood.
You must realize if we're successful, he will replace Walker.
I don't like Frank. but I hate being in the minority even more.
We can't let the Republicans control both houses of Congress.
You've changed since I joined the leadership.
Just getting better at playing the game.
I guess you can teach an old liberal new tricks.
I guess so.
So, tell me who you still need.
My lawyers are saying   that I survive a trial.
Now, I'm not a big fan of those odds,
but I'm willing to take 'em.
If your lawyers are putting it at a coin toss,
then you're paying them too much to be overly optimistic.
And how can I trust Garrett?
He turned his back on  years of friendship.
He could accuse you of the same.
Well, nobody on this planet
wants to see Frank Underwood go to jail more than I do.
I just don't want to be sharing a cell with him.
That won't happen.
All you've given me to go on is Garrett's word.
He's asking you to tell the truth.
Good things happen to those who do the right thing.
And you just expect Frank to lie down,
throw in the towel, hmm?
We don't even give him the chance.
Your testimony knocks him out cold.
Excuse me.
Yes? Oh, thank you.
Hold on.
There you go.
Care package from my wife.
Now, you were saying.
I just want to warn you, she's not herself right now.
They had to put her on some heavy doses.
Of what?
Lithium, mostly.
It was either that or commit her for  days.
Now she just took some, so she might be a little...
Megan?
Stop.
Your mom told me they found you in the lake.
What do you care?
I care very much.
No, you don't.
You don't use somebody you care about.
Whore.
Slut.
Bitch.
Traitor.
That's what they call me.
In my mail. Online.
I wish I'd never called.
I wish I'd never met you.
I feel so stupid believing what you told me.
Thinking that you did care.
I was getting better.
You did this to me.
Every time I take one of these I think of him.
And the next face I think of?
It's yours.
I'm sorry that you felt used.
You weren't.
I just, um...
like I told you, the political landscape shifted and   
and we found...
Megan?
Hello?
I got your text.
I know I shouldn't be reaching out to you, but I thought...
No, that doesn't matter. I'm glad you did.
How is she?
In bad shape.
I'm surprised they even let her out of the hospital, to be honest.
Is there anything I can do?
Should I contact her family or go out there myself?
We should probably leave her alone.
Are you okay?
I'm fine. How about you?
Uh, holding up.
Spent the whole day talking to lawyers.
It's hard on the kids.
They're embarrassed and frightened.
But we'll get through it.
I thought the speech you and Garrett gave was very moving.
Well, it seems to have helped some.
I was inspired by you, actually.
When you admitted to the abortion on TV.
The truth is a powerful thing.
Tricia, I want to apologize.
What for?
I feel partly responsible for everything
your family's going through.
It was my suggestion that you get counseling.
And had I known then, I never would have said a word.
Claire, please. Counseling was a godsend.
Garrett and I needed help,
and it's made things better.
I should be thanking you.
And thank you for letting me know about Megan.
It was kind of you to make that trip.
You're a good person, Claire.
Be well.
I take it this is about my hearing.
Did Walker get to you first?
Barely.
But sometimes barely is enough.
I'm sure he offered you a pardon.
Always better to offer something your competitor can't.
Oh, but I can.
The last time I read the Constitution,
the most a vice president could offer was, um,
smile and a wink.
I think I've proven that I'm not your typical vice president.
Typical or not, you've lost, Frank.
I have an out. You don't.
Garrett will not survive impeachment.
If there's one skill you can't deny,
it's my ability to whip votes.
In the House. Not in the Senate.
Which the Constitution makes me the President of.
And you saw what I did with entitlement.
Hubris is giving you delusions of grandeur, Frank.
Let's say Walker squeaks by.
Yes, you get your pardon.
But you've bound yourself at the hip
to a man who has zero political capital.
And if he gets convicted, we all go to jail.
There's no pardon for anyone.
I'll roll the dice.
Raymond, think like a businessman.
Haven't you built a fortune by minimizing risk?
Isn't that why you stacked Congress all these years,
why you guided Garrett to the Oval,
and why you kept me on as Whip?
Walker is a junk bond quickly depreciating,
whereas I can end the conflict with China
and keep you in the black.
You can't promise better relations with China.
I wrecked them. I can repair them.
Now let's work together, as we always intended to do.
When they put you in that box barely bigger than a coffin,
remember how beautiful the music was tonight.
It might give you some small degree of comfort.
Puccini's a downer. I prefer something much more optimistic.
They won't touch Brown. The trial date is set.
They can reduce the charges.
Dallas won't give. If I keep pressing,
it'll start to look suspect.
What I can do is make sure you don't get prosecuted.
And I stop working for you.
Not quite. I told the U.S. Attorney
that we wanted to bring you on with us.
Cyber terrorism division. You'd get a clean slate, as   
No fucking way.
They're not gonna let your case go
unless we give them a compelling reason.
  There's no o   I've spent half my life fighting the Bureau.
It's the only way I could sell it.
Take this opportunity, Gavin,
before they change their minds.
I want to meet with Douglas Stamper.
No. The deal was I find you a way out.
No, the deal was you help out Brown and you give me my freedom.
You haven't done shit for Brown,
and you still want to keep me under your thumb.
So I meet Stamper, or any kinda deal is off.
Raymond said no.
He said neither yes nor no.
I'll keep the pressure on.
So he could still name you.
He could. Anything's possible.
Well, you have to stop him.
I'm trying.
Well, trying's not enough, Francis.
Well, I can't sit next to him in the hearing room
with a gun to his head.
Now that sounds like an excuse.
It's a reality.
You promised me I wasn't going to have to prepare for the worst.
And I intend to keep that promise.
Well, I want to be sure. I want both of us to be sure.
The only surefire way is for Walker to call him off personally.
Then make that happen.
I cannot force a man who thinks I'm his enemy
to suddenly call me his friend.
I've done what I had to do.
Now you do what you have to do.
Seduce him. Give him your heart.
Cut it out and put it in his fucking hands.
Dear Mr. President,
I'm writing on an Underwood portable
my father gave me when I left for the Sentinel.
It was the words my father said when he gave it to me
that have resonated even more than this  year-old machine.
"This Underwood built an empire," He said.
"Now you go and build one of your own."
Those words have been a large part of what has motivated my life.
I've only written one other letter with these keys.
It did not fail me then. I hope it will not fail me now.
You said I wanted to diminish you.
The truth is, I don't.
You said I wanted to challenge you in .
The truth is, I don't.
You said I wanted the presidency for myself.
The truth is,
I do.
What politician hasn't dreamed about what it would be like
to take the oath of the highest office of our land?
I've stared at your desk in the Oval and coveted it.
The power, the prestige.
Those things have a strong pull on someone like me,
who came from a small South Carolina town with nothing.
But since you assumed office,
my only aim has been to fight for you
and alongside you,
whether that be in Congress or as now,
the battle over impeachment.
Maybe one day I'll have my chance to serve as president,
but not while you are the nation's leader.
And in you, sir, I see a brave man.
A just man. A president whom I would follow anywhere,
no matter how strong the wind blows against us.

When I was  I walked in on my father in the barn.
There was a shotgun in his mouth.
He waved me over. "Come here, Francis," He said.
"Pull the trigger for me."
Because he didn't have the courage to do it himself.
I said, "No, Papa," And walked out,
knowing he would never find that courage.
The next seven years were hell for my father,
but even more hell for my mother and me.
He made all of us miserable.
Drinking, despair, violence.
My only regret in life is that I didn't pull that trigger.
He would have been better off in the grave,
and we would have been better off without him.
I'm not going to put you in the same position
as my father put me in.
You will find enclosed on a separate sheet
a confession to the crimes you have been accused of.
They're false words, but my signature will make them true.
Use them if you must.
If you truly believe that I have only served myself,
then I have forever lost your trust.
All I can do now is give you my freedom to save your own.
I said I would take the fall for you,
and now I give you the means to make that happen.
I am pulling the trigger myself.
We all must make sacrifices to achieve our dream,
but sometimes we must sacrifice ourselves for the greater good.
It is my honor to make such a sacrifice now.
Your loyal friend, still in my heart,
if not in yours, Francis.
The Constitution sets forth the general principles   
Sir? The president's on the phone.
Mr. President.
I got your letter. I had Tricia read it, too.
I'm torn, Frank. Half of me wants to think you're genuine.
The other half doesn't trust a word of it.
Does Tricia feel the same way?
She believes in Claire, which inclines her to believe in you.
I meant every syllable.
I wanted you to know beyond a shadow of a doubt
that I am willing to do whatever is necessary.
Well, then why can't I shake the shadow?
Because I'm a liar, sir.
Because I lack scruples and some would even say compassion.
But that's just the image that I present to the world
because it elicits fear and respect.
But it is not who I am.
My hope was that my letter would prove that to you.
Well, even if you are being genuine,
that doesn't do much for me.
I won't survive impeachment
because I got along with my vice president.
No, I agree you need more than my good intentions.
Proof. That's what I want to see, Frank.
And not just falling on the sword. Show me results.
And then I'll reconsider whether you're worth any of my trust at all.
You're talking votes.
Yeah. Whipping votes was your strong suit.
That's the side of you I want to see.
I've already begun, sir.
Yeah? You have a count?
An approximation. The sands keep shifting.
Well, can we survive the House or not?
Possibly, but Jackie Sharp is making it very difficult.
Give me numbers.
Over half of the  that she needs,
which is why I'd like to start focusing on the Senate.
Don't you think that's premature?
We should be prepared.
The key battle is making sure that you avoid conviction.
Well, you keep whipping, you keep getting me information,
I'll answer your calls.
But don't take that as a sign of reconciliation, Frank.
I'll sing for my supper, sir.
I don't expect it for free.
Let's talk again tomorrow.
Thank you, Mr. President.
You said you wanted options.
Frank didn't leave me options. He fucked me.
You fucked him first when you sided with Tusk.
But who cares what happened each inning?
It's the final score that counts.
Eight years I spent busting my ass in this office.
I can't seem to escape it.
You gonna help us or not?
I need to know what I gain.
  You'll be taking care of.   Specifically.
We'll see what makes sense when all the chips have fallen.
So you just want me to leap off a cliff
and hope for a soft landing beneath?
No one will touch you now. Nobody except us.
We're as soft as you're gonna get.
A job at the White House?
No promises.
Other than something commensurate
with your loyalty and experience.
I could just walk away from it all. Start a new life.
No, you can't. You know you can't.
You'd wither away anywhere but the Hill.
It's never been about the money,
no matter what you tell yourself.
When I left, Frank begged me to stay.
"Power versus money," He said.
Don't reduce myself to a tax bracket.
He was right. And I doubt he begged.
He was half right.
Power is better than money for as long as it lasts.
But it never lasts.
What's your answer?
You've gotten colder since you've taken over this job.
It makes things easier.
On the outside.
And the inside.
I miss you, Jackie.
Tell me if you'll cooperate.
How's your brother enjoying working with the congressman?
Oh, excuse me one second.
Mr. President.
I want you to call Tusk. Tell him the deal is off.
  What?   You were right.
I don't want to take the risk.
But I already spoke to him.
Well, so speak to him again. And tell him there's no pardon.
Sir, I    I    I was skeptical of this strategy at first,
but now that we've gone down this road, we should stick to it.
Linda, do you still want your job back?
Of course, sir.
Then make the call.
I'd rather see what happens in the House
before I get involved in any way.
But if you came out vigorously in defense of the President,
it might convince the Judiciary Committee   
To be honest, I'm not particularly inclined
to be doing Walker any favors.
Now, Michael, I know he revoked your nomination.
He didn't fight for me at all.
Well, he'd just been elected. He wasn't in a position to   
Wrong. He had a clear mandate.
He was in a strong position to defend me.
You're right.
If I had been President I wouldn't have given in so easily.
I would've stuck by you after that article came to light.
In fact, if you'd been our secretary of state instead of Durant,
I don't think we'd be in the mess we are with China.
But the truth is, I wouldn't have
nominated you for secretary of state in the first place.
I would have nominated you for secretary of treasury.
Because your expertise in economics is
even better than your grasp on foreign affairs.
No, if I were president, you'd be secretary of treasury.
If you were president.
That's right.
You can't do this.
What happened?
Was it Frank?
Linda, listen to me   
I understand.
Thanks.
The deal is off.
Did she say why?
No. Other than he changed his mind.
But it must be Frank.
Then we go back to the original plan.
That's right. You plead the Fifth just like you did before.
This is political theater.
  We get past it and focus on the   Jesus Christ.
What is it?
Remy Danton is volunteering to testify to Dunbar, right now.
He volunteered? He wasn't subpoenaed?
Looks that way.
He's gonna sell me out.
That would open him up to prosecution.
Unless he's being protected.
Where's Danton?
I'll call his assistant.
Did you or did you not facilitate foreign money
being funneled into political action committees?
On the advice of my counsel,
I reserve my right to invoke the Fifth Amendment.
Xander Feng claims you not only facilitated,
you orchestrated the scheme.
Now what is your response to that testimony?
On the advice of my counsel, I reserve my right to   
You can reserve your right all day long, Mr. Tusk.
But when you appear in front of a grand jury,
as I'm sure the Justice Department intends,
your silence will be your downfall.
Does the congressman have a question?
You can hide from us all you want, sir.
You cannot hide from a jury of your peers.
  Mr. Chairman.   That's it. I'm done.
I relinquish the remainder of my time.
The chair recognizes the congresswoman from Tennessee.
You have  minutes, ma'am.
Mr. Tusk, our nation is currently embroiled in a trade war with China.
It has gutted our economy.
It has placed our navy in harm's way.
  The president who put us there has    He knew.
Excuse me?
My client reserves the   
He knew. Isn't that what you're all wondering?
Quiet, please.
Knew what, exactly?
There was a mechanism by which a great many contributions
were made over the last  years.
The legality of this mechanism is something
that I continue to believe is within the boundaries of the law.
But as for the mechanism itself, Mr. Feng is correct.
I orchestrated it. I facilitated it.
And the president knew about it.
Danton just canceled.
Screw Danton. We've got Tusk.
Get me the attorney general.
That won't be necessary, Mr. Tusk.
If you'll come with us.
That's a shame.
Handcuffs were another item on my bucket list.
Right this way, sir. You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you.
We'll want a bond. For his cooperation in the hearing.
I'll talk bonds if you'll talk a plea.
Response to the testimony has been swift and vocal.
Protesters have been gathering in front of
the White House since yesterday,
demanding President Walker's resignation.
And an online petition has already accumulated
over , signatures in the past  hours.
The list of lawmakers publicly condemning the president
has grown on both sides of the aisle.
And this afternoon the Chinese ambassador
also condemned the Walker administration,
saying China would not negotiate with a president
who dealt with corrupt businessmen behind Beijing's back.
This at a time when warships from both countries   
Meanwhile the president and first lady
remain bunkered at Camp David and have offered no public response
to the most recent developments in Washington.
I'm here with Ayla Sayyad of the Wall Street Telegraph.
And Ayla, I have to begin by saying that sources
on the Hill are telling me
that the Judiciary Committee may bypass debate all together.
Uh, no one on the committee has gone on record about that.
But do you think these rumors would be circulating
if there weren't some sort of strong preference
to recommend the Articles of Impeachment to the House?
I think it's safe to assume there is strong support.
Every poll I've seen shows
an overwhelming majority of Americans want this to move forward.
I don't think politicians are going to ignore that.
I've talked to a number of my colleagues already.
There's support on my side of the aisle.
  Well, how many do you have?   Five at this point, including me.
That would put us at . We'd still need seven more.
You've seen the overnight polls.
He's dipped down into the single digits.
Are you willing to make a public statement with us?
I think the country could use
a little bipartisanship right now, don't you?
Do you think they're bluffing?
That it's some sort of stunt to sway the undecideds in the Senate?
Michael Kern is bitter and small-minded, sir,
but he wouldn't appear publicly with Mendoza
if they didn't have the numbers.
Well, I imagine we're worse off in the House than we were before.
In fact, I had a very productive conversation with Jackie Sharp.
She agreed to stop the attack
if we give her our support for majority leader after the midterms.
But once Raymond gave his testimony,
she called to say the deal was off.
Raymond really has set us back.
I can't fathom why he lied.
Well, it's retribution.
  For what? The energy crisis?   No.
Did you offer him something?
Well, Raymond's testimony hurts,
but it can't finish us off.
It's impossible to prove a lie.
Impeachment is inevitable.
Public opinion is the adversary now. Facts no longer matter.
You should give Kern a call. The personal touch.
If he came back to us,
it might make the other Democrats get cold feet.
Well, China isn't helping.
President Qian won't return my calls.
Beijing must smell death.
They're just exploiting the situation for leverage.
Let's not worry about China for the moment.
One battle at a time, sir.
Maybe I'm finished, Frank.
Maybe I need to start accepting that we won't pull out of this.
Mr. President, I know you're tired.
I know this has been hell for you.
And, yes, impeachment would be an awful blow.
We'd have to fight tooth and nail in the Senate.
And, yes, we'll have to beg and compromise
to regain our political capital.
But we have it in us, sir.
No matter how many scars it leaves us with.
It's not just us, Frank.
It's Tricia. It's my children.
I stay awake at night, thinking how much it would crush them,
seeing their father hauled off.
Sir, that won't happen because I won't let it.
If we're confronted by the worst,
I'll make sure you never step foot behind bars.
You have my word on that.
He's in the darkness now.
And I'm the only beacon of light.
Now we gently guide him toward the rocks.
Mr. President, you also still have my letter.
It's not too late, if you want to use that option.
No, you're more useful to me on the Hill than in handcuffs.
I'll call Kern.
  Goodnight, sir.   Night.
How much did Green tell you?
Enough that I showed up.
He probably didn't mention Rachel Posner, huh?
Don't worry. He doesn't know.
I do.
You have her in an apartment in Joppa.
I have your movements.
I have your text messages before you destroyed your phone.
But that's more than enough.
I'll bet a lot of people would like to know what she knows.
Now you listen to me very carefully.
Whatever you think you've got,
whatever you intend to do with it,
I don't respond to extortion the same way that Green does.
What Green promised you,
that can be undone in a heartbeat.
And that's why you're here. Make sure it isn't.
You want my protection.
I don't trust Green or anyone at the Bureau.
Who else knows about this?
No one.
Why should I trust you?
'Cause we both have too much to lose, man.
Get dressed.
What    what are you doing here?
Put some clothes on.
Why    why?
Now. Let's go.
Did anyone contact you?
Where are you taking me?
Answer my question.
No. Nobody.
There's someone who knows about us.
Who knows where you are.
And when we've met.
Are you gonna hurt me?
Nothing's going to happen if you tell the truth.
I am. I    I haven't been contacted by anybody.
Stop lying, Rachel.
I will do whatever you want.
Please, just don't hurt me.
What I want is for you to answer my questions,
so I can help you.
All you have ever done is fuck up my life.
You fucked up the fellowship.
You fucked up what I had with Lisa.
Even when I did what you asked.
And your sick fucking visits,
and reading to you like a fucking child.
What is wrong with you?
Why can't you just leave me be?
  Why do you have to be such a fucking      stop!
Rachel? Don't be stupid.
Rachel?
Everything's gonna be fine.
All I've ever done is try to protect you.
That's what I'm trying to do now.
You have to believe that.
I didn't have to.
Been a lot easier if I didn't.
But I did. I did it because I   
What are you doing?
Yesterday we completed hearings with regard to Articles
of Impeachment for the president of the United States.
The chair will now entertain motions from the committee.
Mr. Chairman.
The chair recognizes the congressman from Alabama.
I move that we put our recommendation directly to a vote
so that debate on this important matter may take place
on the House floor, open to all  members.
Are there any objections to bypassing debate in this committee?
We will now vote on recommendation of the Articles
of Impeachment to the full House.
Those in favor of recommendation say, "Aye."
Aye.
Those opposed?
Nay.
The ayes have it.
This committee officially recommends Articles
of Impeachment proceed to the House floor.
He's here.
The vice president is just arriving now here at Camp David.
We except President Walker to speak within the hour,
announcing his official resignation
as president of the United States.
  How are you?   I'm fine.
Mr. President.
I have coffee in the kitchen.
  Would you like some?   I'm fine.
Well, you're about to become
the most powerful man in the free world.
You don't have to do this, sir.
I spoke to Kern last night.
He's not gonna back down.
So we'll beat him down.
No, Frank.
My approvals are at eight percent.
Even if I avoid conviction, I have no mandate to lead.
So better I step aside with some dignity
so the nation can start to heal.
I can never fill your shoes, sir.
You don't have a choice now.
Your letter.
Well,
shall we go introduce the th president of the United States?
Effective immediately,
I am resigning the presidency of the United States.
Tricia and I believe that this is the best course of action,
not only for us and our children,
but for the country.
It's a sad day for us. I can't deny that.

Frank Underwood will bring virtue, experience,
and courage to the Oval Office.
I have been blessed to have him as my vice president.
But I'm even more blessed to call him my friend.
It has been...
the greatest honor of my life
to serve this country as president.
I thank my family, my staff,
and all of those who have supported me.
Despite the last few months,
my faith in this country has never been stronger.
God bless all of you.
And god bless the United States of America.
Thank you, Mr. President, for those words.
Good luck to you, sir.
Sir, please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
I, Francis J. Underwood...
I, Francis J. Underwood...
Do solemnly swear...
Do solemnly swear...
Mr. President.
Mr. President.
Madam Secretary.
The rest of the Cabinet is awaiting you at the White House.
We'd like to give you a national security briefing right away, sir.
I'm aware of the particulars.
Can you please get Beijing on the phone?
Qian hasn't returned the President's calls for two days.
Well, there's a new president now.
Please get him on the line.
Two hours ago, President Underwood,
in his first act as commander in chief,
gave orders to the seventh fleet to vacate Japanese waters.
This was a result of a productive conversation
with President Qian,
who gave similar orders
to Chinese naval vessels in the same region.
He moves quick.
Do you mean with the Chinese or with Walker?
  Mr. Feng?   What is it?
U.S. Justice Department. We need you to come with us.
  Where?   You're going back to China.
I have asylum.
No, sir, you don't. Your asylum has been rescinded.
I have it in writing. Unconditional and permanent.
Sir, I'm telling you, your asylum has been rescinded.
Now, please, gather your things and come with us.
Revoking his asylum will have consequences.
But we're solid from a legal perspective?
Legally yes. His initial paperwork hasn't been processed,
and we can claim he poses a threat to our national interests.
But it diminishes the integrity of our State Department.
What's more important, Cathy? Integrity or peace?
You know they'll execute him.
The Chinese are right about one thing.
Sometimes you have to sacrifice the one for the many.
Let's get back to Washington.
Okay. Please let me know. Thanks very much.
  Anything?   Not yet.
See if you can track down anyone from his regular AA meetings.
I spoke to the moderator.
He said he hasn't seen Doug in several weeks.
I checked all the hospitals, his landlord...
Sir, everyone's here.
All right, when this is all over
I want you to work with Nancy on finding Doug.
I've already alerted the D.C. Metro.
They put out an APB on his car.
We'll find him, sir.
Claire?
Just outside.
Let's go, Nancy.
Ladies and gentleman,
the President and the first lady.
Francis,
I know your birthday isn't for a couple weeks,
but I got you something.
  What's this?   Open it.
I had a new one made.
I love you.
I love you, too.
You go ahead.
Come on.
We earned this together.
Take a few moments for yourself first.
I'll be out here.House.of.Cards.SE
Hey, Pop.
Been a while, hasn't it?
Did you see that motorcade roll up?
It's the first time that the President of the United States
has visited Gaffney.
Can you believe it?
Oh, I wouldn't be here if I had a choice.
But I have to do these sort of things now.
Makes me seem more human.
And you have to be a little human when you're the president.
He couldn't even afford to pay for his own gravestone.
I paid for it out of my own scholarship money from The Sentinel.
Nobody showed up for his funeral except me.
Not even my mother.
But I'll tell you this, though, Pop:
when they bury me, it won't be in my backyard.
And when they come to pay their respects,
they'll have to wait in line.
You should let us take a photo at the grave.
He wants privacy. The man's honoring his father, for God's sakes.
Here's the info you were looking for.
And we have that scheduled for next Tuesday at  a.m.
That's still good for you, right?
Excellent. I'll confirm it.
Excuse me.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.
The president is ready to see you now.
Jesus.
I'm devastated.
I love this man as if he were my son.
Now, he's a fighter, and I'm sure that he'll pull through.
Our prayers are with him.
"...said President Underwood during a press conference yesterday.
The Maryland State Police
and Federal authorities have yet to locate
Mr. Stamper's car or name any suspects."
You want more of this, brother?
Or maybe the sports page?
"Game Six of the World Series
went scoreless for  innings
before a rain delay
that turned an already epic evening
into one for the history books."
We need a doctor in room three-one.
Douglas?
Can you hear me?
I want you to blink if you can hear me.
Again.
My name is Dr. Lanjwani.
The president's office asked me to look after you personally.
You're getting the very best of care, okay?
Douglas, I want you to blink if you can feel this.
Good. Good.
How about this?
Okay. Excellent.
And this?
How about here?
Relax.
Relax. Perfectly normal at this early stage.
Relax.
That's good.
Okay. Get some rest.
Are you gonna hurt me?
I will do whatever you want, please just don't hurt me.
  Does that hurt?   A little.
All right, let's go ahead. Try and make a fist for me.
  Remy.   What's that?
Remy Danton. Was he here?
He was. Just checking on your progress.
Go ahead, make that fist for me.
Lion.
Rhinoceros.
  Camel.   Good.
What color is Rudolph's nose?
  Rudolph?   Reindeer.
Red.
It's red.
The President of the United States?
Douglas?
Who is the President of the United States?
Frank Underwood.
  What year are we in?   .
What month is it?
It's December.
I have to get back to work.
Douglas. Listen to me.
You suffered a compound fracture  
I know what I fucking suffered!
I need you to hear me this time.
There was damage to your left frontal cortex.
Your motor skills will be a struggle.
Your emotions will be unpredictable.
There's a long road ahead, and we can't rush it.
  Let's do the test later.   No.
We'll finish it now.
What was your mother's name?
She was young and beautiful.
Jacob fell in love with her while she was watering a lamb, and...
she became his wife after he worked seven years
to earn her hand in marriage.
Push back. Heel into my hand.
Breathe.
Back up. Deep breath. Ready?
Push. Push.
Doug.
Focus.
The report I submit to Congress today
includes evidence that
would normally warrant criminal prosecution,
but the Justice Department won't pursue charges
in accordance with the presidential pardons.
I'm grateful for the hard work Ms. Dunbar and her team
have dedicated to their investigation.
In response, I'll be forming a bipartisan commission
to examine campaign finance reform so history does not repeat itself,
and so that our nation can heal from these wounds.
I got bacon-cheese and regular. Which one you want?
Just a minute.
Remember when you'd never eat a burger
if it didn't have bacon on it?
Dad would get so pissed
because he hated the smell of bacon grease on the grill.
I'm trying to listen, Gary.
The president's hands are tied. Might as well let him burn.
They're getting their marshmallows ready.
Look at Underwood's approval rating.
It's worse than Walker's before he resigned.
That's a deep, deep hole to climb out of.
The Republicans are gonna have their fun for a while.
Plenty to hammer him on in the general.
And they're out for blood.
They lost big on education and entitlement reform.
And if the rumors
about America Works are true...
For the left, that's just too far to the right
and for the right, it's too far to the left.
They need me back.
Where? The White House?
We got to turn the corner, start ramping up for .
He might turn this around.
You don't really think he's gonna win, do you?
The guy's experienced. Underwood has a lot...
He'll recover.
He's a behind-the-scenes guy.
He's not comfortable in the spotlight.
How about you recover first?
...glad-handing and kissing babies.
This is gonna be a long  months if this proves any indication.
It can be a lot of chest-thumping
but nothing really getting done.
The Xybenetrin will help with depression.
The buspirone is for anxiety. Here you go.
I'd like to prescribe you something for the pain, but with your...
Well, any patient with a history of addictive behavior  
I know. It's fine.
I can handle the pain.
He looks a lot better.
No, he's still asleep.
I have to go.
Okay.
Is this a bad time?
No. It's fine.
No, it's just no one told me you were coming.
Francis sends his love.
He would visit himself, but with the media...
No, I understand.
He did come before, when...
  Both of us.   I know.
I saw the flowers. Thank you.
  You look well.   I'm getting there.
I just want to get better so I can get back to work.
We're looking forward to that.
We can use all the help we can get, actually.
Yeah. Been watching the news.
Francis, he's at his wit's end. The Republicans...
won't send him a single bill he can sign.
  And the Democrats aren't much better.   Bob Birch?
Blind leading the stupid.
How's Remy working out?
Well, we'd much rather have you there, but he's doing a fine job.
Doug, do you... recall anything?
  About what happened?   Why?
Did the police find something?
Not that we're aware of.
And we've asked them to hold off questioning you
until you're feeling more like yourself.
Rachel, she...
I don't remember.
Yes, you do.
A carjacking.
  A man.   What sort of man?
That part's fuzzy.
It could be anyone, then. Any man.
Yeah. Any man.
And he got frightened?
I chased him and that's all.
Any idea where she is?
No.
Because it's important that we find her.
I really don't know.
That's the truth.
I want you to tell all of this to the police,
exactly what you told me,
about the carjacking and the man. Nothing about her.
I got it.
If you need anything, or remember anything...
  It's good to see you.   You, too.
That's good. One more time. Up and forward. That's good.
Excellent. Breathe.
Good.
Good. Good.
Okay.
Let's try this one. You're doing a great job.
Keep breathing. Good.
Good job, Doug.
Okay. Moving forward. You got it.
Great. Great job.
Keep going.
Good. Breathe.
Excellent. Good.
One more.
Great job.
One more time. It's almost done. Ready?
Keep breathing.
Just his voice. He said, "Get out of the car."
Anything you can say about the voice?
Was it, uh... Accent? Lisp? High? Low?
Deep.
That's all I remember.
Then I laid on the horn. I...
I remember him running.
Like a blur, I got out.
I chased him.
I'm not sure. I must have...
What were you doing in that part of Maryland?
Mr. Stamper?
Sir. What were you doing in that part of Maryland?
I drive sometimes to think.
There was a lot on my mind with work.
I drive to clear my head.
Have you found the car?
We don't have anything other than what you just told us.
How's your mood been? Any episodes?
No. The meds are working.
You just telling me what I want to hear?
No. I feel good.
Okay.
I'm gonna sign your release today.
But it's important you take it easy at first.
Everything's gonna be much harder in general.
I know.
Do you have someone who can look after you?
Yeah. My brother Gary's in from Ohio.
Good. How long is he here for?
  A while, I guess.   Okay, great.
It's important you go to your meetings.
Stay on top of your sobriety.
Take this. It's for the steroids I prescribed you.
It's one shot into the right thigh, once a week.
The nurse, she...
  She showed me how.   Okay.
You do this?
No, it wasn't me.
I talked to my boss.
I can stick around for another couple of weeks
while you transition back.
You should get back to your family.
Nah... Sarah's fine with it.
The kids are, too.
Gary, we've hardly spoken in ten years.
You've already gone above and beyond.
All right. You want me to go?
I'm fine.
Thanks for everything.
Okay.
I mean, I'm just a phone call and a plane ticket away.
Safe travels.
Take care.
Hey, Gary, I...
Send me some pictures of the kids.
Yeah, I will.
But one of the things I admire about you
is that in Washington, DC,
which is so gridlocked, you get things done.
And I understand you've got, um, a new piece of legislation,
a major new initiative you're rolling out. What is it?
That is correct.
It's a new jobs program that we're calling America Works.
So it's a fantasy novel.
This is a fundamentally different look
at how to solve the problem of unemployment.
It has the size and the scope of the New Deal.
So it's a socialist redistribution of wealth
wherein the baby boomers will latch onto the millennials like a lamprey,
and just keep sucking until they're as dry as a crouton?
This is about putting people to work
and avoiding the entitlements entirely.
Well, I like the sound of that.
So what, we're gonna privatize Social Security
and then raise revenue by hunting the elderly for sport?
  Good plan. Use that.   No, as I said,
this is a fundamentally different approach entirely.
And you think that the Republicans
in Congress will cooperate with you?
Oh, I think that it has been proved
that both parties want the same thing.
A new president in ?
No. No, I think actually, I think unemployment, eradicating it,
and I think a strong economy is something both parties want.
Okay, speaking of everyone,
there's a recent poll by Reuters.
I wanna get this right. It says that eight out of ten Americans
agree that you lack, quote, "Effectiveness and leadership."
Uh, look, I don't let polls like that bother me.
I think that once the nation sees AmWorks in action,
they will change their attitudes.
I'm sorry, "AmWorks?"
I'm sorry   I didn't realize it was called AmWorks.
Is that like Amway? Is it a pyramid scheme?
Is that what you're selling the American people?
No, it's actually just an abbreviation to make it easier to say.
Well, if you make it small enough,
uh, maybe it'll be easier to swallow.
You know, even though you're a Democrat, I respect you.
But let's just take a look at the facts here for a second.
You've been president for six months,
and again, I wanna get this right,
unemployment has gone up,
our trade deficit with China has increased,
the number of vetoes has skyrocketed.
I'm not entirely sure that I'm confident
that you'll be able to eradicate unemployment the same way
you've been able to eradicate your approval polls.
What, you know, what do you  
How are you going to get it across to the American people?
Doug?
Seth?
Yeah, it's me.
Mrs. Underwood, she gave me this phone, but  
I know. Is something wrong?
No. I want to speak to the president.
Is it urgent?
I want to talk to him about the America Works program.
So nothing urgent.
It's not an emergency, no.
'Cause that's what this phone is for.
Will you pass on my message?
You're late.
I switched cabs three times.
  Were you being followed?   Didn't want to take chances.
You know why I asked you here.
I don't know where she is.
Then you need to find out.
I ran her social, her name,
police records, taxes, everything.
She could be tossed in a ditch by a john for all I know.
  You work at the FBI.   What do I get in return?
My protection, like you asked.
I thought you had something to offer. Something real.
Like money?
Like getting me out of the Bureau.
You make that happen, maybe I can help you.
That was a condition, for your charges being dropped.
See, you don't still know people.
I shouldn't have even come here.
I am your only safety net.
You think I would have turned over all the AT T records
without leaving a backup with somebody?
I'm not gonna blow my get-out-of-jail card on a wild goose chase.
Does anyone suspect anything?
At the Bureau?
Nobody has a clue about her.
If that gives you any peace of mind.
Doug?
Tell him it's urgent.
We're aiming for sometime in May.
As soon as we agree on a date with the Russian delegation,
you will be the first to know. Uh, Greg.
The Summit with Petrov here in Washington,
what'll be the focus of the talks?
A bilateral approach to the Middle East.
As you know, the Palestinians have refused to negotiate
until Israeli troops leave the Jordan Valley.
We hope to address this with President Petrov
so that we can move on to a whole host of other issues.
Sara.
So this bilateral approach doesn't include Israel and Palestine.
The State Department is briefing all interested parties.
The summit's really just a first step. Ayla.
I'd like to change course to the America Works program.
Please.
I've spoken to a number of the president's policy advisors,
who say there's been a lot of disagreement on the economic team
as to exactly what form this jobs package should take.
  Which advisors?   Nice try.
To be clear, this is far more than just a jobs package.
It is a comprehensive plan,
which aims at full employment within two years.
So as such, there are a lot of details to be worked out.
So your sources are inaccurate.
It's not so much a disagreement
as it is debating the finer points of the plan. Jess.
Just to follow up. What are some of the finer points?
Or the broad strokes, even.
No one from the White House has said anything.
When we have a plan to present, we will present it.
Jess?
Is America Works a reaction
to the president's low approval ratings?
An effort to offer some sign of progress ramping up to the elections?
We've been working on this plan since day one.
It has nothing to do with the approval ratings.
But as for the election... uh, whose turn is it to ask today?
  Mark?   Is the president running in ?
Today, the priority is good government, but...
Ask me again tomorrow.
Thank you, everyone.
We've got a window at ten.
I'll call him now.
Please, sit down.
John. Samantha.
You spoke to a journalist about disagreements in this room?
If that happens again, you're off the team.
And speaking of the disagreements in this room,
we now have an even bigger one,
because Remy has shown me your work so far and...
it's toothless.
I stood in this room three months ago
and gave you all very clear direction.
Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,
every entitlement program that is sucking us dry,
I want it all on the table.
And this doesn't go nearly far enough.
So we obviously have to get back to some basics.
Remind ourselves of some of the facts that are before us  
  Sir, if I may     No, no, no, no.
I will speak first, and then you will speak, Paul.
This is what the average senior citizen gets,
one year from entitlements,
whether they were a janitor or they ran a hedge fund.
That   This money is a job
we could be giving to a single mother
or a student just out of school.
Now, at the moment,
By , it'll be over half,  cents.
Entitlements are bankrupting us.
Now, I had Remy conduct a little poll.
"Doing what's best for my country
means doing some things that I don't like."
Seventy-four percent agreed with this statement.
Seventy-four percent. Now, what does that tell us?
We have to do the things that people won't like.
And even when we do,
three out of four of them will go along with us.
And why? Because we're promising jobs.
And again, where are the three areas
that we're gonna be creating these jobs from?
Infrastructure at the state and federal level.
Increasing the size of the military,
and working with our friends in the private sector to start  
I'm sorry, sir, but I have to interrupt.
The programs that you want to scale back or dismantle
are the bedrock of the American dream.
You work hard, you pay your taxes  
No, I'm sorry, they were the bedrock of the American dream.
But they're not anymore.
Certainly not for the ten million people who are out of work.
But practically speaking, a thousand special interests,
organized labor, opposition in both parties.
Now, we can do a version of what you're proposing  
I don't want a version.
I want a vision.
As head of this team, and I think I speak for everyone,
  we have done     Speaking as the president,
who chose this team and for whom it works,
I want five hundred billion dollars
to put ten million people to work.
I don't care how much it hurts.
I don't care how controversial it is.
Your job is to find a way.
It's my job to convince Congress and the American people.
Your job is not to sell me on your version of my program.
Now, are we all clear on what our jobs are?
Good, because I want to present this proposal
to leadership in  days.
  Let's make it happen.   Paul?
  Your services are no longer needed.   Excuse me?
Let's keep it quiet, let's keep it cordial.
  Thanks for all your work.   I'll get my things.
I'll have them sent down to you in the lobby.
Hello?
Yeah. I'm on my way.
God!
God!
It'll be a few minutes. Please, have a seat.
  How long have you known?   Two months.
It hasn't impaired my judgment on the bench.
And it's early on.
We don't expect any real symptoms for quite some time.
I won't be wandering around the Supreme Court
in my boxer shorts anytime soon.
But I'd like to retire now, long before we get there.
Well, Justice, I want to thank you for having the courage
to come and share this news with me.
Are you sure the diagnosis is correct?
My doctor's the same that treated the Vice President's wife.
He's the foremost Alzheimer's specialist in America.
Yes, I made Donald my vice president.
I'd rather him be a pain in my ass here than over in Congress.
And even the Republicans
couldn't refuse a man who just buried his wife.
Terrible how quickly Marjory went.
I'm telling you this now
so you have time to think about candidates
before I announce my retirement.
  How much time can you give me?   How much do you need?
I'm about to introduce America Works to Congress.
It's sure to be an uphill battle.
And I'd prefer not to add a Supreme Court nomination to the mix.
The Republicans will just use it as leverage.
I've heard rumblings. Entitlements on the chopping block?
All the more reason to keep you on the bench.
It's sure to be challenged in the Judiciary.
Mr. President, I want to spend as much time
with my wife as possible
in the good years that I have left.
When Marjory was ill, she wanted the same thing.
She left the Smithsonian, and you know what?
She hated every second of being at home, of not being productive,
of not doing what she loved.
It made her time with us much harder, and...
it made her deeply unhappy.
Work is the best distraction. I wish she hadn't retired.
And, uh... before she lost her lucid thought,
she said she regretted it, too.
Can you give me six months? A year at the most? That's all.
Just enough time to get this program up and running
before I have to face a Supreme Court fight.
  I need to think it over.   Oh, of course.
  Speak to your wife.   I'll walk you out.
  I better get that research center.   Yes, a deal is a deal.
Now, good God, Donald, let's get something done.
Now you see why Donald said yes.
He may hate my guts,
but there's nothing like a death in the family
to separate the wheat from the bullshit.
Send him in.
Yes, sir.
The president is ready to see you now.
Doug.
Mr. President.
The doctor told me your recovery is going very well.
Yeah. Well, there's this.
But everything else is as good as new.
It's great to see you.
Claire and I have been worried sick about you.
Thank you for the gifts.
For looking out for me.
I don't have that many close friends. I count you among them.
I appreciate your saying that, sir.
Oh, drop the "Sir." We're old pals.
Well...
I'm the one who should apologize.
You gave me another chance. You trusted me.
And what happened, I take responsibility for that.
No, for putting you in that position.
Stop. It's not necessary.
  I endangered you just as     Yeah, but all I care about
is that you are alive and getting better.
Let the rest of it go.
  You know how devoted I am.   You don't have to say it.
You proved it time and time again.
Now, come on, come on, sit down.
Right here.
I should've taken care of her when I had the chance.
I haven't found her yet.
But when I do, I'll make sure that no one else does.
You can count on that, sir.
How is it, uh...?
Probably better if we don't talk about it.
Right, of course.
Well, they told me you needed to see me.
Well, sir, I... I know that it's a lot to ask,
and that I probably don't deserve it,
considering the mess I put us in.
And I'm sure you have your doubts.
I realize it couldn't be anything too visible, but...
I've been following everything with America Works.
Well, that's a ways off.
But I was thinking that I could help.
There should be a targeted plan for lobbying committee leadership.
And I can work with the political team,
coordinate with House leg directors, chiefs of staff  
I was in Gaffney yesterday, visiting my father's grave.
He never took care of himself.
He ignored his heart problems and... he paid the price.
You have to respect your own mortality, Doug.
I don't want to be standing over your grave.
Now, look...
There is a place for you here, I promise.
But we have to go about this slowly.
I'll work from home. Only direct contact with you or Remy.
You know the way that you can help me the best
is to do exactly what you're doing right now,
focusing on your recovery.
I would never forgive myself
if I put too much on your plate too soon.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
But look, I meant what I said.
When you are truly ready.
Yes, sir.
Stay as long as you like.
Three hours ago, we pinpointed him here,
in the Shabwa region of Yemen.
Cooperation?
I spoke to the foreign minister a few minutes ago.
  Civilians?   Two dozen, non-IDs.
That's too many.
Our concern is that he could be on the move at any moment.
Sir, with Petrov coming to Washington  
It's taken us two years to track Abdullah down.
We can't ignore every opportunity between now and the summit.
Do you have eyes on the village?
Yes, sir.
He's in this building here.
Kill zone is anyone within  meters.
If we take him out with no civilian casualties,
I'll authorize the strike.
Sir, if I may, I really think  
President Petrov is coming to Washington in less than two months.
Our entire Middle East policy hinges on that meeting.
We don't want to give the Muslim community any viable reasons
to obstruct things if we can avoid it.
So find a way to do this without killing civilians.
Thank you all very much.
May I have a moment? It's about Claire.
If your husband nominates you, I can't pull any punches.
Lack of experience. Nepotism.
That's right.
And you think I'm a dilettante.
No. But plenty of people will.
I've been preparing since Francis took office.
What I lack in experience I'll make up for in work ethic.
Why Ambassador to the UN?
You wield far more influence as the First Lady.
That's not the same as contributing in a concrete way.
If we vote down your confirmation,
are you comfortable with that sort of public embarrassment?
I know that's a risk.
  You're running in , right?   No comment.
Francis and I are impressed
by how the Republicans are consolidating around you.
You'll make a good candidate.
Not by linking arms with the president's wife.
If I'm a disaster, it makes for a good campaign ad.
If I do a good job, nobody can fault you.
Either way, it doesn't hurt your chances in .
Well, I appreciate you coming by before going public.
It is classy, and thoughtful.
I won't actively block you.
The rest is on your shoulders.
Thank you, Senator.
Tell the president I'm doing this out of respect to you.
Frank's still on my shit list till I beat him in the general.
I will.
Why didn't you come right away?
I had a meeting I couldn't miss.
Fucking Washington.
  This is gonna hurt.   I know.
Here's some Percocet. It'll help with the pain.
I'll write you a  day prescription.
I can't.
  I'm not supposed to     What was that?
Nothing.
All right. You're good to go.
  How did it go with Mendoza?   Well, I think.
He'll support you?
He won't openly fight it.
Well, that is a big step forward.
  How did it go with Doug?   No real news.
Hey, are you in here again tonight?
I'm still getting over this cold. I don't want to get you sick.
Well, don't stay up with all that too late.
Francis?
When do we announce the nomination?
Listen, I wasn't gonna bring this up tonight,
but you should know that there are some serious doubts
from people at the State Department.
You mean Cathy.
And some on her staff.
Like what?
Well, in over your head, wearing two hats, the obvious things.
And are you saying this because you don't want to move forward?
Not at all. I'm sharing with you so you fully understand
what you're getting into.
And I do.
Maybe we shouldn't rush this.
  You're having doubts now, too.   I didn't say that.
Only you should put more thought into whether
this is the right move for you. That's all.
Good night, Francis.
Feel better.
Francis.
I want you to announce the nomination this week.
I don't want to wait. The timing will never be good.
And I don't want to waste time
when I can be getting real experience under my belt.
So set a date, hold a press conference, and let's do it.
Claire!
I was not trying to suggest that you not be the ambassador
when I brought up Cathy. I was just  
We made a deal,
and now you're trying to back away from it.
  That is not true.   Then you would've told Cathy
it's happening to make her peace with that.
  It's not that simple.   Yes, it is.
  You're the president.   I can't control Congress.
I'm trying to get two major initiatives off the ground
and every move I make will have an effect.
We agreed to this before we ever stepped foot in this house.
  I know what we agreed to.   How am I supposed to run for office
at some point if I don't have a legitimate track record?
We have to survive the next  months,
accomplish something, and then look ahead.
Francis, let's be realistic.
There's no guarantee you'll get elected.
I need to be prepared if you don't.
You have that much faith in me, do you?
More faith than you have in me, it seems.
I believe in you more than anyone, Claire.
Then show it. Nominate me.
I shouldn't have to convince you.
It's not about convincing.
It's about being honest about the political climate
  that we find ourselves     I'm almost  years old.
I've been in the passenger seat for decades.
It's time for me to get behind the wheel.
That needs to start now. Before the election.
Because who knows what will happen?
What if you lose?
I will not be a placeholder president, Claire.
I will win. And I will leave a legacy.
You mean we will.
Excuse me, sir.
The Secretary of Defense is on the line. He says it's urgent.
Yes?
Okay.
I'm coming.
Not until I get there.
  I'll be right down.   Yes, sir.
Get dressed. I want you to see something.
Come in.
  Here.   Thank you.
Okay, great.
Get undressed.
How did this happen?
Doesn't matter.
Let me help you.
I'll... I'll do it.
I'll be gentle.
Don't be gentle.
Like that?
Yeah.
  What the fuck?   It's bourbon.
  I     That's all. It's just bourbon.
  Take it.   I really don't want to.
Nothing's going through the skin.
I just want you to squirt it...
into my mouth.
Okay? Please.
  Is that our target?   Yes, sir.
Mr. President, this is a highly classified operation  
I'm clearing the First Lady for this operation.
Yes, sir. Forgive me, sir.
We are armed and ready, sir.
Abdullah is in one of those vehicles.
We can't tell which one.
If they go in three different directions,
we wouldn't know where to strike,
and if he makes it back to the mountains,
we'll lose our satellite track on him.
Are those children?
I can't say definitely, sir, but they could be.
Do we have authorization, sir?
  Proceed.   Proceed with the launch.
And ten seconds.
Target is destroyed, sir.
Thank you, everyone.
I still want it.
All right.
All right.House.of.Cards.SE
I'm glad you brought up nepotism, Senator.
Um, if this were an outright appointment,
that would be one thing,
but in this case, the president can only nominate.
It's the Senate that deems me worthy.
I'm here to convince you that I am.
Although, I must admit,
my husband never remembers to put the toilet seat down,
so he could be trying to make it up to me.
My larger concern is your experience. You have very little.
Well, a decade ago, I founded a small nonprofit
and I built it into a major global player.
I shepherded a number of bills through Congress on its behalf.
And over the last year,
I've dedicated myself to sexual assault reform,
and have made meaningful strides.
Now, while this may not qualify as statecraft,
it does illustrate my effectiveness,
the same effectiveness I plan on bringing to the United Nations.
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood. I yield the remainder of my time.
Uh, Mrs. Wallace of North Dakota, you have eight minutes.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mrs. Underwood, allow me to get specific.
What is your take on UN Resolution ,
the imposition of sanctions on the Congo for the  
The illegal mining and smuggling of mineral resources.
Yes. The United States voted against this resolution.
The DRC is already wracked with economic hardship,
compounded by an unstable government.
It ranks  out of  in GDP per capita.
I think we need to encourage foreign investment
and develop new forms of economic growth
rather than make one of the world's poorest countries even poorer.
From a national security perspective,
the United States maintains
a strong interest in the success of the DRC.
  We want a stable nation...   They're here.
...that can help us in combating the spread
of Islamic radicalism throughout the continent.
And in order to achieve that, we need to work as its ally,
not its disciplinarian.
Good morning.
Mr. President.
Jackie.
Terry.
Shall we?
Now you all have the, uh... overview. But what we have here today
  is the comprehensive breakdown     Sir, before we begin  
Look, Bob, I know you have some serious doubts about this program.
But just let me flesh it out first,
and then I promise we can address any questions that you might have.
  Uh, Mr. President     Ten million jobs.
Can we all agree that that's a good thing for this country?
Universal employment.
It's the key for our keeping the White House in .
It's the only chance we have of winning back majorities in Congress.
Now, the election's only  months away.
We need to do something bold, something decisive.
We need to redefine our party.
Actually, that's what we wanted to discuss.
You're right, we do need to redefine the party.
We need to do it with a fresh face.
You weren't even elected to the office in the first place.
The pardons hurt you. Approvals are low.
We're not casting blame, sir.
We just believe that this is best for the party.
I suspected this was coming, but months from now.
I was hoping by then I'd have something to show for my efforts,
that I could preempt their doubts with progress.
They're nervous. They're being impulsive.
It's a bit early to be deciding something like this.
Shouldn't we revisit this when we're closer to the primaries?
What do you think, Terry?
Like you said, sir, we only have  months until the general.
Less than half of that to Iowa.
We would want to settle on a candidate soon.
Someone who the whole party can get behind
like the Republicans are getting behind Mendoza.
And who would that be?
We haven't had a discussion on that yet.
We came to you first, out of respect.
  Well, there must be a shortlist.   No, not yet.
It'll be a process to find the right person.
And we were hoping that you would be a part of that process.
Obviously, this is a request, Mr. President.
It's your decision.
But if you do run, sir, you won't have our support.
Jackie?
I stand by the rest of the leadership.
Well, this is certainly a lot to think about.
Let's table our discussion on America Works for another time,
but thank you all for being so forthright.
I'll get back to you on this issue a little later on.
Would you like us to stick around for a while?
We wouldn't want the press to think we came all the way here
  for a five-minute meeting.   That's a very good idea.
No raised eyebrows.
I'll have some refreshments sent for you into the Map Room.
Wonderful.
Thank you, Mr. President.
As a vocal proponent for the Sexual Assault Bill last session,
are you concerned about your relationship with the US military?
No, I'm not, Senator.
I worked closely with the Joint Chiefs on that bill.
What if there were a peacekeeping mission in, say, Burma,
to quell civil unrest,
and the United Nations asked us to contribute troops,
to put our servicemen and women's lives in peril.
If you're using Myanmar as a hypothetical,
I think we're a long way from that, but as Ambassador  
My question concerns the use of US military.
The US military is irrelevant. The current situation  
Excuse me, Mrs. Underwood. The US military is irrelevant?
Well, I   That's not what I said.
"The US military is irrelevant."
Well, in the, in the context of   I meant...
uh, that there are plenty  
I have the utmost respect and appreciation for our troops, sir.
Not with statements like that, you don't.
Senator, if I may, I can explain.
How do we explain to the men and women who serve,
who put their lives on the line,
that our ambassador thinks they're irrelevant?
I think that's an unfair characterization of what I intended  
I am not characterizing anything, Mrs. Underwood,
you said the words.
And now you're trying to backpedal your way out of it.
  You're trying to take my words     Don't interrupt me.
If you will stop interrupting me, I can explain  
No, you see, we ask the questions, you answer them.
You're not allowing me to answer the questions, Senator.
If you could maybe listen instead of grandstanding.
The position you're being considered for
requires calm, cool diplomacy.
What concerns me even more than the military comment
is your demeanor.
Is this what we're to expect from our ambassador?
A hothead?
Go ahead, Mrs. Underwood, I'm listening.
Maybe it's leverage for another play.
Scare the wits out of me and then come with the big ask.
You sure there is one?
America Works. They want to kill it.
Or soften me up to consider another VP candidate for the ticket.
They're no fans of Blythe.
Could be anything, any combination of things.
  What?   You saw it?
  Saw what?   The First Lady, sir.
Jesus.
I better call her.
She's still in the hearing, sir.
I need to see this whole thing. Let's get ahead of it if we can.
  The Solicitor General is here.   Cancel it.
  You've already postponed twice.   Postpone it again.
We can't put it off, sir.
It goes to the Supreme Court in less than a month.
We have bigger fish to fry.
An American citizen was injured by a drone strike.
That Walker authorized, not me.
But you're the sitting president.
If we lose this, it undermines your authority.
The media is all over it.
We need our rhetoric in line with the Solicitor General's.
All right. Christ! Send her in.
I'll put this clip on your computer, for when you're done.
Terry Womack. Today. Privately.
Ms. Dunbar.
Before we begin, I'd like to clear the air.
Your report. You did good work, necessary work,
and I admire you for it.
I appreciate you saying that, sir.
And you understand the position I was in with the pardons.
That's politics, sir. Not my expertise.
What's past is past?
My focus is the argument I'll present to the court.
She sees me as the bank robber who made it to the county line.
But she's smart enough to leave her badge at the door.
So, the case.
As you know, sir, we think the State secret defense is strong.
When I consulted with the CIA on the  
I'm wondering if State secrets is the best tactic.
Both of Mahmoud's legs were amputated.
He will be in the gallery, in his wheelchair.
That's a powerful image.
Even Supreme Court Justices have hearts.
We need to stay in their heads.
A procedural route is clearly    
Excuse me.
Yes?
Uh, tell her I need to watch something
and I'll call her back from my study in two minutes.
  It's my wife. I'm sorry.   Please.
  ...you answer them.   You're not allowing me
to answer questions, Senator.
Maybe you would benefit more
from listening than grandstanding.
I just watched. How can I help?
I'm calling Senators.
I think it would be heavy-handed if you did too.
Well, I don't blame you for getting upset.
  You didn't deserve that.   I'm a target now.
  That's the price of admission.   We both are.
The leadership, they don't want me to run.
  What?   Yeah, that's what they said
before I could even present the program.
  This soon?   Yeah, that's what surprised me.
  The entire leadership?   All of them, including Jackie.
  That woman has no sense of loyalty.   Well, we'll see.
I'm gonna meet with Womack. Turn him around.
They only have strength in numbers.
Continue, please.
As I was saying, we think our procedural defense is strong.
State secrets prohibit the introduction of evidence.
Assuming they won't dismiss outright,
the argument will focus on deference to the executive.
Separation between the courts and foreign policy.
They simply don't have the security intelligence
to second-guess covert operations
while we're facing threats on multiple fronts.
Sir?
  I can't do this now.   Excuse me, sir?
My office will be in touch. Apologies. Thank you very much.
Maybe you would benefit more from listening than grandstanding.
Joining me now from Capitol Hill,
CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent, Dana Bash.
Dana, what is the mood at the Capitol?
Right, I understand, but...
We already have several Senators publicly saying
that they're gonna vote against Mrs.Underwood
because of her comments.
A number of others I've spoken to
have gone from supporting her...
  Right.   ...nomination, to being on the fence.
But, Dana, she's correct, isn't she?
Mendoza was grandstanding.
Maybe. But even so, if you look at the numbers here,
this is doing real damage.
The vote was always going to be close...
Yes.
...things aren't looking good for the First Lady.
  No, I understand, but     Could her military remark be...
  It's Mendoza.   ...a slip of the tongue?
I appreciate your time, Senator. I hope you'll reconsider.
  He's on now?   Yes.
Turn that off?
Senator, hi. Thank you for returning my call.
Sorry it took so long. I had a ton of interview requests.
I just wanted to apologize
if I came across as disrespectful in any way.
That was wrong of me.
I know you didn't mean it, Claire.
It's just unfortunate how things are playing out.
I realize you can't vote for me yourself,
but I was hoping that maybe
you would say something to the effect to  
What, to the press?
  Or even privately, to your colleagues.   I can't do that.
Senator, the vote should center on my merits,
not a few moments where you and I took the gloves off.
Well, I think that was telling, don't you?
How you behaved under pressure?
Senator, you know you were taking out of context what I said.
Of course I was. I was trying to rile you up.
And I succeeded.
I wish I hadn't,
because it's gonna make things really tough for you.
But, if you can convince my
colleagues to change their minds despite that...
why, you'd make a great Ambassador.
  Thank you for your time, Senator.   Good luck, Claire.
He's a son of a bitch.
Let's try Peterson next.
Approvals go up and down.
We can't allow ourselves to be held hostage by public opinion.
We're being held hostage by the Republicans.
We can't beat them with you as the face of the party. Period.
Have you all really thought this through?
I'm a sitting president.
But not an elected one.
But still, to abandon the incumbent,
and all the advantages that that entails?
Which is the problem. We don't see any advantages.
And if you were to come on board with us,
if you were to announce that you're not running,
it wouldn't seem as if we're abandoning you.
The party looks unified.
Bob Birch has been trying to do me in
since I forced the Education Bill down his throat.
I think he's using shaky logic to get you all on board
so he can carry out some personal vendetta.
It was my idea.
Not Bob's.
I hope you work with us.
We meant it when we said it.
We would like for you to be a part of the conversation.
  Hello?   Hey, it's me.
  I can't hear you.   Hang on a second.
  Seth?   Yeah.
I was just calling to check in. See how things are going.
Good. Things are going really good.
Hey, hold on one quick second.
Listen, uh, I know
you're rolling out the AmWorks program soon.
I'm sure Remy has a plan in place,
but I've been putting together a list.
Some key representatives
and what they might want in exchange for support.
Skeletons in the closet, that kind of thing.
Yeah, that's on hold for the moment.
  You're not rolling it out?   It's just on hold.
  Is something up?   No, everything's fine.
We're focused on the summit next month with Russia.
But you're good? You getting stronger?
  Yeah.   In good spirits?
Never been better.
I'll email you my ideas. Let me know what he says.
  Will do.   Thanks.
Senator, when we met in your office last week,
we had a long, productive conversation.
I can't imagine ten seconds during the hearing would  
Senator, may I call you back in five minutes?
Thank you.
  Francis?   No luck. It was his idea.
What are you going to do?
Top  bundlers from last cycle.
I don't need the leadership if I can get the money.
  You?   Too early to tell.
Well, I'm here if you need me.
I've always said that power is more important than money.
But when it comes to elections, money gives power...
well, a run for its money.
It's Francis Underwood.
I thought you said he was handsome.
Sorry to interrupt.
Well, if she doesn't receive a text with the word "urgent,"
it's not an official date.
How are you? Alan Cooke.
  Remy Danton.   Nice to meet you.
I'm just gonna go, uh... take a few calls.
There's an espresso coming with your name on it, okay?
Nice meeting you.
So here we are.
I wasn't part of the decision. They told me ten minutes before.
Who are they talking to? About running?
No one yet, as far as I can tell.
There has to at least be a list. Even a mental one.
Some ideas.
We need you to find out.
You know, when Walker resigned,
Frank's president, you're Chief of Staff.
  But me?   You're still in the leadership.
  Assistant Whip.   It's a bullshit title.
I'm out of the inner circle.
What do you want?
I want to be on the ticket. His VP.
All we want is a little information.
What you're asking is... disproportionate.
It's repaying a debt.
A big one. I whipped the votes for impeachment.
I should get to cash in on that.
There's no way he'll go for this.
Then there's no reason for me to be your eyes and ears.
I'll get back to you.
During business hours.
No, Mark, we ran it in the White House screening room and I swear to God,
when those jets crashed into one of our Seawolf subs,
the Joint Chiefs screamed.
No, they didn't want you to use it and certainly not for free.
David, I'm not just asking you for money,
I'm asking you to be one of my campaign chairmen.
That buys you a lot more than a night in the Lincoln Bedroom.
Claire Underwood for Senator Hylbrook.
I agree. We can never rely solely upon Security Counsel support.
Scott, we're  months out.
Now, if you wanna be on the ground floor,
you got to shit or get off the pot.
The key is to provide leadership, to lead by example.
I was hoping we could hit Maidstone for a quick eighteen.
No, I'm a terrible golfer.
Exactly, you'd have the pleasure of beating a president.
Now wouldn't that be a good cocktail story?
I've spoken to almost every Republican in your committee, sir.
Yes, they're taking their cue from you.
Is there another number where I can reach him?
It's important that we speak this evening.
Yes, anytime, no matter how late.
A little faith, Tom. That's all I'm asking.
Oh, yes! I know, I don't like being called "Ma'am" Either.
If I made every decision based on what makes people feel good,
I'd be a talk show host, not the president.
Well, I know Admiral Jennings is a good friend of yours,
  I can call him personally.   Don't let fear drive you.
That's not how you run your business, is it?
I know you've been in my shoes,
and sound bites are not who we are.
Penny-wise and pound-foolish.
I'm so sorry, Senator, did I wake you?
Yes, no, I'll try back again tomorrow.
I can't fault you for being shortsighted.
I hope you won't fault me for having a long memory.
Good night!
I'm waking people up now. I'll start again in the morning.
  How's it looking?   I had to flip a coin? I don't know.
  You?   Not a single backer yet.
  Not one?   California's still awake.
Maybe I'll have better luck out west.
I'm going for a run. I need to do something.
  It's late.   Well, I'm too restless.
Well, I'll be here, singing for my supper.
It's humiliating to have to beg from some kid who was on Facebook
before his testicles descended, but that's  
Derrick, Francis Underwood. Do you have a few minutes?
I'll be running along the Mall tonight.
That requires a full detail.
How soon can you be ready?
We'd far prefer you ran on the track.
I'll be running along the Mall.
Yes, ma'am. We're going to need the First Lady's detail, ASAP.
  This is off the record.   Agreed.
You've called my office every day
for the last six months with one question.
I call everyone in the leadership.
I get the same non-answer from all of you:
"Frank Underwood is our president..."
He has our undivided support.
Birch slipped up once.
He said "unwavering" instead of "undivided."
I wanted to drug-test him.
There was a meeting this morning in the White House.
I was there on Pebble Beach when you came out.
It lasted four and a half minutes.
  You were in there for an hour.   We were inside for an hour.
Doesn't mean the meeting lasted that long.
What happened? Why so short?
You're the Pulitzer finalist.
America Works?
Is that why the president went to the Capitol this afternoon?
No one from the White House would say.
Have a good night.
You chose me. What's your play?
When you write about presidents, people pay attention.
It'll come down to the wire.
I'm confident, but I don't want to leave anything to chance.
Well, according to Erikson, I have  votes as of this morning.
Well, I know, Senator, but that's not enough.
I need yours.
I have every intention of running for president.
I need to know you two are with me.
If you have any doubts, now's the time to let me know.
Nancy, wipe the schedule clean.
Yes, everything.
We don't leave this office until we have a plan.
Ma'am? The Easter Egg Roll we were scheduled for?
  Right.   If this is a bad time...
No, that's fine. Please, come in.
Hello?
Yes... Claire Underwood. He's expecting my call.
Hi, Sheila. They're beautiful.
Would you mind setting them up, please?
I have a couple more calls to make.
Hello, Senator. Yes, I'm well. How are you?
The nomination of Claire Underwood, of Washington DC,
to be the Representative of
the United States of America to the United Nations.
Yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll.
  Mr. Abner.   Yea.
Mr. Braun.
Mr. Bray.
  This one's a little too pink.   Girls like pink.
This is more than pink. It's neon.
  Uh, I'm choosing four?   Yes, ma'am.
  Willa?   Up by two:  to .
  Ma'am, we can finish up later.   No.
  Uh, what's next?   The commemoratives.
These are really special.
A black egg?
  Yes, with patriotic tipping.   It's still a black egg.
Engraved with POTUS and FLOTUS signatures.
Ma'am? Final tally:  to .
Against.
  The press?   In the briefing room.
I'll just be a few minutes. Would you mind waiting?
Not at all, ma'am.
I just heard.
I'm so sorry.
The press is waiting.
Well, they can wait.
Do you want me to come with you?
No. I just want to get it over with.
Claire. You  
Good morning.
Naturally, I'm disappointed
that the Senate did not confirm my nomination today.
But I'm very grateful to have been afforded the opportunity.
I'd be remiss if I did not thank my husband
for all the faith and trust he placed in me.
He's always supported me in achieving my goals.
I look forward to continued service as First Lady.
Thank you.
Um, let's go with the... green, the blue, and the cream.
And for the rare one? The Golden Ticket, so to speak?
Red. That one's beautiful.
Thank you. Excuse me, please?
You ever try to do this?
Balance an egg?
We used to do this as kids.
You can't change the laws of physics, can you?
I was wrong. It's too hard.
Sir?
Fighting the leadership, raising money.
We can't get them to do what they're dead set against doing.
We'd need six months just to get them back to square one.
We have to reverse our thinking.
When the wind's blowing at gale force,
there's no point in sailing against it.
What do you have in mind?
The White House Counsel's office, please.
I don't care about their schedules.
If not today, tomorrow morning.
Should I invite Jackie, too?
Well, she qualifies as leadership.
  What about her ask?   Stall her for now.
Let's see how the meeting goes.
I want you to write the speech, every word.
  Yes, sir.   And no leaks.
You'll have a draft in three hours.
And, sir... Doug emailed me a lobbying strategy for AmWorks.
  Do you want to look at it?   Of his own accord?
  You didn't tell him?   No, I didn't say a word.
It must be what he gathered from watching the news.
  How is he?   Uh, Doug seems fine.
I've been calling him, like you asked.
  But he seems all right?   Well, he tells me things are good,
although I don't think he'd admit it if they weren't.
Why don't you stop by from time to time, since I can't.
  See him in person.   Yes, sir.
And send me his email.
Claire?
I'll be in my study if you need me.
What're you working on?
  Brought you a coffee.   My savior.
The leadership meeting yesterday morning.
It lasted four and a half minutes.
Where'd you hear that?
That's not long enough to reject a major domestic agenda.
I wasn't in the meeting. I don't know how long it lasted.
  Something went down.   If you say so.
Uh, I didn't hear anything about it.
Could've been the president was called away.
  That happens all the time.   Not this time.
How do you know?
Clearly, I have a source that knows more than you.
Most sources do. At least they pretend they do.
Thanks for the coffee.
Two sugars next time. I'll remember that.
You talked to Ayla Sayyad.
I can either be an asset or a liability.
You think this puts you on the ticket now?
Not if you tell him.
But the smart move would be to advocate on my behalf.
Don't strong-arm me, Jackie.
You're the man in the middle. Who else would I strong-arm?
I want to be on your team, Remy.
We do well when we're on the same team.
You have more calls?
No. I'm done.
  Who spoke to her?   I have no idea, sir.
  Well, it's your job to know.   Things are moving fast.
I'm just trying to stay ahead of them.
Well, we need to move faster. Has the meeting been set?
Eight AM tomorrow. I just heard back from Birch's office.
Good. Let's have the networks ready to go live by nine.
One more thing. Jackie.
I think you should decide sooner rather than later.
If we're gonna go this route,
we need every ally we can get.
After the meeting. We'll discuss then.
You've emerged.
I took a nap. Last night was... I didn't get much sleep.
Me, neither.
We're gonna find something for you.
Some other position, or something as First Lady, I promise.
I know.
  What are you doing up?   I've got to go over my speech.
It's happening tomorrow night.
What speech?
It's premature, isn't it?
Read on.
Yes?
Yes.
Thank you. Please.
I put a great deal of thought into what you've all asked of me.
I challenged myself to keep an open mind.
I will not run for president.
Look, they're thinking it's too good to be true, and it is.
I lied in the Oval Office before.
I didn't want to take the chance this time.
It's too big a deal to jinx myself.
At nine o'clock tonight,
I will announce to the nation my decision.
What's the catch?
I wanted us to meet here in this room for a reason.
For the past five months,
my team has sat at this very table, developing America Works.
You know how much the program means to me,
and I want it to mean as much to you.
  So there is a catch.   No, an opportunity.
Look, we all know the  
All right, let's just say for... argument's sake
that this table here
represents the next year and a half, all right?
So, this is us right now.
And down there at the end, that's the election.
Now, if I did run, I'd spend the next few months fundraising.
And then somewhere around here, I'd formally announce.
And then even if I did win the nomination,
say, somewhere around here,
I'd start to have to face off
with a Republican challenger, probably Mendoza.
And then things would get brutal.
Daily, daily events.
Fending off attacks.
Launching my own.
And... you're right.
In the end...
...I'd probably lose.
I would spend  months campaigning,
which would leave no time to govern.
But you have opened my eyes.
I feel liberated.

America Works. But I need your help to do it.
You're putting an awfully big price tag on this, Mr. President.
No, you've put an awfully big price tag on this.
You're asking me to be a placeholder for  months
and I intend to govern.
And if America Works succeeds,
then whoever you choose to run in 
not only has the backing of a united party,
but a formidable legacy.
But Social Security? Benefits. Entitlements.
We don't want to present a fresh face
only to shoot ourselves in the foot.
Then let's not pretend to unite the party,
let's unite the party behind this legislation.
We'll never get it past the Republicans.
We are not here to negotiate!
You want forward-thinking, Bob? Then think forward.
You want a fresh face for ? You wanna work together?
Then present my program to Congress.
And if it dies there, so be it.
But I want us to fucking try!
I am prepared to vacate this chair.
Meet me halfway.
Any moment now,
the president will be addressing the nation live from the East Room.
The White House has remained silent
on the subject of the president's speech,
but sources in Congress say it will focus on the jobs initiative
he's been planning to unveil for several months.
The program, dubbed America Works,
was developed in secret.
Any details are the by-product of speculation,
but sources suggest it will have elements
from both liberal and conservative agendas.
What remains to be seen
is whether a Republican-controlled Congress
will cooperate in pushing the program forward.
The White House has faced significant opposition from the GOP
since Congress began its current session,
and many speculate
that the president's liberal application of veto power
may leave congressional leaders disinclined
to support this new jobs program.
Additionally, many Democratic supporters of President Underwood,
from his days as House Majority Whip,
were voted out of office in November,
diminishing his personal influence over legislators.
Low approval ratings are a continuing concern
for the Underwood administration.
And congressional sources suggest
the choice to tackle unemployment
may be part of a campaign strategy for .
Recent polls indicate that
less than one third of all Americans say they would
consider voting for President Underwood...
...job growth has remained
a popular platform in national elections,
and if today's announcement is received well,
President Underwood's
campaign certainly has an opportunity to benefit.
Thank you.
Sir, we're ready for you in five seconds.
Good evening.
For too long, we in Washington have been lying to you.
We say we're here to serve you,
when in fact, we're serving ourselves.
And why? We are driven by our own desire to get reelected.
Our need to stay in power eclipses our duty to govern.
That ends tonight.
Tonight, I give you the truth.

The American dream has failed you.
Work hard? Play by the rules? You aren't guaranteed success.
Your children will not have a better life than you did.
Ten million of you can't even get a job,
even though you desperately want one.
We've been crippled by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,
by welfare, by entitlements.
entitlements.
Let me be clear. You are entitled to nothing.
You are entitled to nothing.
America was built on the spirit of industry.
You build your future. It isn't handed to you.
And the problem with Washington
is that we haven't given you the tools to build it.
The only way for us to serve you
is to give you the means to serve yourselves.
Well, that's exactly what I intend to do.
Not handouts. Jobs.
Real paying jobs.
In the next few weeks, the Democratic leadership
will introduce a program called "America Works."

to put the ten million Americans who are unemployed to work.
All of them. If you want a job, you get one.
The cost is five hundred billion dollars.
Now, that's a lot of money.
To pay for it, we'll need to rethink Social Security,
healthcare and benefits from the ground up.
We can't maintain the welfare state as we know it.
Now, that's not a popular thing to say.
Anyone running for office wouldn't dare utter those words.
Every advisor and consultant and staff member
would beg a presidential candidate not to say them.
But I can say them.
Because I will not be seeking
the Democratic nomination in .
Candidates are cautious.
They must equivocate. They dodge and tiptoe.
But I'd rather leave this office having accomplished something of value
than secure another four years having done nothing at all.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt ushered in an era of hope and progress
when he proposed the New Deal.
And at the time, his reforms were considered radical.
But he once said, "This country demands bold,
persistent experimentation.
It is common sense to take a method and try it.
And if it fails, admit it frankly and try another.
But above all, try something."
Roosevelt would have understood better than anyone
the necessity for trying something different.
The New Deal succeeded for many years,
but we must now try something newer before it fails us.
If America Works succeeds,
we will reinvent the American dream.
If we fail in our attempt,
we will admit it frankly and try another.
But above all, we must try something.
Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America.
It's two in the morning.
Yeah, I just left the White House.
The press conference, phone calls, emails,
the rest can wait until tomorrow.
  Were you asleep?   No.
This is a cool place.
How much is your rent?
I thought you said AmWorks was on hold.
Well, it was and then it wasn't.
The leadership didn't want him to run.
Who told you that?
Nobody. But I figure it's the only reason he'd make that speech.
  He's still gonna run though, isn't he?   He says he's not.
I know him better than you ever will, Seth.
There's no way he doesn't run.
Is that why you're here? Because he needs my help now?
No, I just   I wanted to check up with you in person this time.
  He asked you to.   Yes.
I did send him your email, though.
  What did he say?   I'm not sure if he's read it.
You should probably get some sleep, huh?
Big day for the press team tomorrow.
You can report back. Alive and well.
Is it okay if I stop by now and then?
Do I have a choice?
I don't, but I can't force you to open the door.
Whatever you want.
Thanks.
I'll see you soon.
Ms. Dunbar.
Mr. President.
I had a lot on my mind when we last spoke.
  The speech last night, it was     Yes, it was a big decision
and I apologize if I was distracted.
  Not at all, sir.   So, the drone strike case.
You've been pursuing the State secrets defense.
Yes, sir.
  Heather   May I call you Heather?   Please.
The American people are sick of secrets.
That's the point I was trying to make last night.
I promised the truth, and now we're going to deliver.
What truth is that, sir?
A man had his legs blown off. An American citizen.
We're going to own up to that.
We're going to admit that the CIA conducted the drone strike
  and explain the reasons why.   That information is classified.
Not anymore.
You have my permission to make the classified brief public.
Sir, that is not a sound legal approach.
But it's what the country needs.
We're not appealing to the country.
  We're appealing to nine justices.   Wrong.
We're appealing to both by taking responsibility.
Yes, a man was maimed, his family members were killed.
But hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives were saved as a result.
I understand the emotional logic,
  but we can't     You sat right there and told me
  even Supreme Court justices have hearts.   Yes, but  
Far be it from me to tell you how to do your job.
I've never practiced law a day in my life.
But I have written them.
And occupying this office, I know what the country needs.
It needs closure.
Let me work on a new argument.
  Thank you, Heather.   Thank you, Mr. President.
Where do you want these, ma'am?
Anywhere. Just not in here.
Okay.
  Scott?   Yes?
Here's a couple more.
 Let the towns drift slowly by
 Listen to the steel rails hummin' 
 That's a hobo's lullaby 
 Do not think about tomorrow 
 Let tomorrow come and go 
 Tonight you've got a nice warm boxcar 
You want a peanut butter and jelly?
No, thanks.
Is everything all right?
I want the UN job, Francis.
The Senate goes home in two weeks.
I want a recess appointment.
I prepared for it. I can do this.
And after it's all over,
if I've done the job I know I can do,
I'll be positioned for anything I want.
Claire  
Now, I checked with the White House Counsel.
There is precedent for a recess appointment
after a rejected nomination.
Only once, but you wouldn't be the first.
And I know you'll take a hit politically.
And I know people will think I don't deserve it.
They'll have doubts in me.
But what if... this is as far as we get?
What if it's all over in  months?
I don't want to wait, or settle for something else,
  when I've put all this work into     Okay.
I'll do it.
  You sure you don't want half?   I'm not hungry.
I'll be in my study.House.of.Cards.SE
This is what the freedom to assemble looks like!
Stop silencing the press!
Stop persecuting the opposition!
Stop imprisoning people simply because they're gay!
You're destroying Russia's future!
When Petrov's motorcade arrives,
have the band already playing as loud as they can.
I'll speak to the Colonel.
  What about the Pussy Riot girls?   I briefed them myself.
Here's a list of the issues they want you to discuss with Petrov.
  We're good to go.   Tell them I did.
Sure it's a good idea to have them at the dinner?
It's a smart idea. They're dissidents.
They've been nothing but a pain in Petrov's ass.
He wants to co-opt them with a photo? Fine.
If it's important to him, it's important to me.
  Bob.   Mr. President.
We have to get these amendments out of committee.
Get AmWorks on the floor.
We might be able to squeeze a couple through, but not all seven.
Then restructure the funding.
Shoot for one amendment in one committee.
Try Ways and Means.
The Republicans will never go for a lump sum.
We have to split it up into jurisdictional parts.
When I announced America Works,
I promised ten million jobs.
Maybe it's time to lower expectations.
  No, look     Pardon me, sir.
President Petrov's motorcade is  out.
  Thank you.   I'll let you go.
Bob, we have a few more minutes. Please sit down.
You have a lot on your plate today.
Why don't we pick it up tonight at the state dinner?
Looking forward to it, Mr. President.
What is the face of a coward?
The back of his head as he runs from the battle.
  Welcome, Mr. President.   Thank you, Mr. President.
This is your first visit to the White House?
Yes, yes. But my third president.
I have reviewed your proposal for the Jordan Valley.
Impressive.
So you liked the proposal?
The answer is no.
It's not a joke, Mr. President.
I have no interest whatsoever in pursuing your plan.
The Jordan Valley is the trees instead of the forest.
And this bilateral approach, it's... alienating.
I don't often see eye to eye with Ms. Caspi,
but it does feel like you're asking the state of Palestine
to support a plan without having a seat at the table.
Well, our goal is to soften Russia,
to bring them in as a partner first  
If we can get the Russians to agree to a joint force,
monitor the valley together, then they're invested.
They won't be a thorn in our side when we move forward  
How can we count on the Russians?
Does your husband truly believe he can trust Petrov?
The president is optimistic.
All we ask is that you remain open-minded.
I hope you'll convey our
dissatisfaction directly to your husband.
I'll be sure to share your concerns.
Ambassador Underwood will remain in contact with both of you.
I shouldn't have interrupted you earlier.
In the meeting. It was out of place,
and I should have let you do all the talking.
It's fine.
I know you have doubts about me.
The recess appointment. We haven't discussed it.
  And we should.   It really isn't necessary.
It is an unorthodox dynamic, yes.
You will always be the First Lady.
This is your plane, after all. But we can work around that.
Yes, I know, but I want you to know that  
Mrs. Underwood, the president is on the line.
How'd it go?
  Should we conference Cathy in?   No, just tell me.
A lot of pushback. They aren't happy.
Well, they'll get on board when the time comes.
  What about you?   He said no.
  First word out of his mouth.   No to everything?
Oh, he might just be playing mind games,
trying to throw me off balance,
but this is a guy who was brought up through the KGB, after all.
We're gonna have to have you and Cathy use the light touch.
We need to massage this.
Let's include her in this phone call.
No, just tell her. I have to go in soon.
It's important we don't bypass her.
If it looks like we're leaving her out of the loop, Francis...
All right, put her on.
I can't tell you how much it would mean to the team.
To have your qualifications, your expertise on board.
Even just having your name on the website.
I appreciate your saying that, Congressman.
Brad. Please. Congressman's what the interns call me.
All right. Brad it is.
Now as for your title, I was thinking Special Advisor?
  Title doesn't matter to me.   You pick what you want.
And you make your own hours. Come and go as you like.
Uh, compensation, would  a year work for you?
The cap is .
Well, the extra K would come out of my re-election fund.
I mean, you deserve more than the cap.
That's a very generous offer.
Well, I expect you to earn it.
I really want to make my mark this session.
  That's more than Underwood paid me.   I'm sorry?
When I was his chief of staff, I made the cap.
He never came anywhere near .
Well, like I said, I think you deserve  
It's too much money, Congressman.
Well, I disagree, but,
hey, I'm not gonna argue if you want to get paid less.
As I was saying, this transpo bill,
we really have an opportunity to make a difference.
Ladies and gentlemen, the session is over.
Please, right this way. Thank you for coming.
I hear you've recently taken up surfing.
We have a few spots on the Black Sea.
It's mostly so I can pose for the photos.
Yes, I've seen them.
It plays well with the young people.
It's important they see their president has some fun,
doesn't take himself too seriously.
I have a gift for you.
I'm sorry for the delay.
I hope we didn't keep you waiting too long.
Shall we?
This was handmade by Tomas Vu, a very talented American artist.
He laser-etches images on one side, and on the other side...
he puts Beatles lyrics.
Back in the USSR.
It's a museum piece, but you can still ride it.
You should come out to my dacha in Sochi sometime.
We'll surf together.
The water is cold as hell, but... the women are very warm.
Oh, I'm not sure what Claire would think about that.
Well, bring her along.
It's crawling with artists out there.
She might find something she likes.
Mr. President, I'm intrigued.
The first thing you say to me is "No" the second you arrive,
and the next moment you're inviting me to your dacha.
Who am I dealing with?
I believe I was clear when we first met. What confuses you?
Our delegations have been discussing these issues for months.
Yes, but discussions are not the same as commitment.
And, uh, I'm telling you now.
There will be no commitment.
You could've told me that on the phone.
I assumed you were undoing an insult by having me here.
What insult is that?
Two of your predecessors never invited me to Washington.
This summit is not just for show.
I want to make meaningful strides toward peace.
The Middle East is hopeless. History tells us that.
I'm offering you the chance to make history.
I'll be honest with you,
because you've been kind enough to invite me to your country.
Russia has nothing to gain from peace in the Middle East.
And more importantly, nothing to gain from working with America.
Israel has always distrusted us.
You expect that to change?
We expect to build trust over time.
How was your meeting with the ambassadors this morning?
Ambassador Aruri called me.
They have their doubts,
but we encouraged them to keep an open mind.
He described it as grave concerns.
They will acclimate as soon as we establish  
Has your husband made direct overtures to Israel and Palestine?
All formal communication
has been handled through the State Department.
But your husband can't possibly believe they'll comply.
Gentlemen, for the purposes of these talks,
I'd appreciate it if you refer to him as the president,
not as my husband.
Of course, Madam Ambassador.
And you really should be addressing Secretary Durant.
She speaks on his behalf more than I do.
Our apologies, Madam Secretary. Please, continue.
We'd like to finish reviewing the specifics, so page , please.
Mr. President, we're already working together on several fronts:
nonproliferation, the War on Terror, North Korea.
I don't see any reason that the Middle East should be any different.
  Because it's an American plan.   It's not an American plan.
  I'm promising equal terms.   Oh, promises.
Carter promised equal involvement,
then shut us out of Camp David.
Clinton did the same with Bosnia.
I'm the president now.
That won't happen this time.
Until  months from now, when you are replaced.
I'm jealous, Viktor.
You don't answer to anyone. You have no real opposition.
You know exactly how every election is gonna turn out.
Well, it's not like that in the United States.
I'm not running because I can
do things a candidate can't do, like this proposal.
Please, Mr. President, we both know you'll run.
Now, whether you win... Who knows?
Brass tacks. If you could have anything, what would it be?
I came with nothing to ask.
Men like you don't show up for dinner without an appetite.
It was a long flight, Mr. President.
How about we stop here for now.
I rest my eyes a bit and
put some thought into this with a fresh mind.
Maybe I'll... think of something I want.
We'll talk more later, at dinner.
Of course, if that's what you prefer.
He knows exactly what he wants, but he needs to be wooed.
Progress, nonetheless.
You can't turn a "No" to a "Yes" without a "maybe" in between.
Gentlemen...
Deputy Director coming through.
Orsay? Come with me, please.
We got Asher.
Two-thirty this morning. He was scared to death.
, he gave us six terabytes of compressed files.
All  million AT T users.
You hid your goodies with the wrong person.
  He wasn't the only one.   I think he was.
You can't arrest me for charges that have already been dropped.
Relax. No one's arresting you.
From the reports I've been getting,
you've been doing an excellent job for us.
If you stay straight, sky's the limit.
Bigger assignments. Manage your own team.
You know I wouldn't be here if I had a choice.
But you do have a choice.
You can make the most of this second chance if you want to,
but... you have to prove you want it.
  Names.   That's all I've ever wanted.
No.
Asher's going to give up names.
  He wouldn't do that.   He might.
Let's hope none of them tell us
about anything we didn't charge you for.
You have a future here, Gavin.
All right. Back to it.
Keep up the good work.
We have to wine and dine.
  Charm them senseless.   Them? Who's the other?
Birch. He's sitting on AmWorks like his ass is afraid of the sun.
Please don't make me talk to Bob.
You just focus on Petrov. I'll deal with Bob.
Excuse me, sir. We're all set.
President Petrov is in the Yellow Oval.
Thank you, Calista.
I think I may need to do some damage control with Cathy.
  Why?   I've been trying to be deferential,
but I think it's coming off as patronizing.
  Well, that was the risk.   I know.
Is she feeling threatened?
Threatened, no. Possibly overshadowed.
I think I'm getting too much attention
and it's tough to be effective
when I don't have Cathy on my team,
so I may need to win her over.
Well, let's not forget where the focus is tonight.
Since when can't I do two things at once?
  You're crooked.   What?
  Ready for battle.   Yes.
The Vice President of the United States, Donald Blythe.
  Mr. President. Welcome.   Mr. Vice President.
Thank you.
President Petrov, welcome.
It's a pleasure.
You look beautiful.
Oh, it's serviceable.
  You look fantastic, as always.   Thank you.
All eyes at the table will be on you, not them.
Senator Mendoza. Soon to be candidate Mendoza.
The rumor mill begins.
You started with Reagan, no?
Staffed on his ' campaign.
He has a portrait of the Gipper in his office wearing a cowboy hat.
When men were men.
Bob, I had a thought.
Dave Blanchek is on Armed Services and  
I don't want to hold up the line.
  Mr. President, a pleasure.   I want to move Birch.
Put Mendoza next to me instead.
Alan. You clean up well.
Class by association.
  Where's your date?   I don't have one.
I can walk you in too, if you'd like.
No. Wouldn't want to ruin the picture.
Ah, our special guests.
I'm so delighted you could be with us.
Thank you so much for coming. Mr. President.
Was anything on our list discussed?
  Why don't we take a photo first?   Good idea. Hm?
Viktor, tell me. Are you in love?
I don't know about... love, but...
I'm learning to enjoy being divorced.

"Howdy, and please don't steal the silverware."
Now that I have exhausted all of the Russian I know,
Claire and I would like to welcome all of you to the White House,
as we host President Petrov
in this historic state visit.
A century ago, a century and a half ago,
de Tocqueville wrote,
in regards to America and Russia, the following:
"Their point of departure and their paths diverse,
nevertheless, each seems called
by some secret desire of providence,
to one day hold in their hands the destinies of half the world."
Well, I'd like to amend that tonight and say,
not just half the world,
the entire world looks to us for leadership.
So, to President Petrov,
and all of the great things
that our great nations will do together.
  Mr. President.   Hear, hear!
Which is Russian for, "Never trust the French."
And thank you to the President
and First Lady for your grace and hospitality.
Now, a little more recently than de Tocqueville,
about, uh,  years ago,
Mikhail Gorbachev came to this very House
and talked of an end to our "Winter of discontent."
I think it's safe to say that that winter seems far gone now.
And here, on this beautiful May evening,
I welcome a "Spring of enchantment."
Now we all know which of you brings the enchantment to the table.
To you, Mrs. Underwood.
  And, of course, your lesser half.   Ah, thank you.
Now I'd like to toast three others in this room tonight.
Nadya Tolokonnikova, Masha Alyokhina,
and Pyotr Verzilov.
Now, I know we had our differences.

a deep love of our country.
To you. And to Russia.
Mr. President, Nadya and Masha would like to make a toast.
      !   To Viktor Petrov,
whose loyalty runs so deep he's given his friends
  half of the country.      
Who's so open to criticism,
that most of his critics are in prison.
You made your point.
Now, please, sit and let us all
drink and laugh, like true Russians do.
Well, Mr. President,
this is proof why you made the right decision
never to have children.
My staff prepped them.
  They assured us.   It's nothing.
  I admire your grace.   Please. Not another word.
I knew Pussy Riot was a bad idea.
You should go.
No. Best thing is not to comment.
It lowers us to their level.
Juice or soda?
Diet something, if you got it.
Who are they?
My brother's kids.
Adorable.
I got a job offer.
Yeah? Where?
Brad Petite. Special Advisor.
From Hawaii.
  Junior Congressman?   That's right.
I like him. He's a good guy. He's ambitious.
He offered me a lot of money.
  Yeah?   Two-twenty.
Jesus.
That's more than I would ever make at the White House.
  You arrange the job?   No.
Did the President?
  What are you talking about?   Don't bullshit me, Seth.
This is the first I'm hearing about it.
Who's the Senior Congressman from Hawaii?
Chair of Appropriations.
I know him, I'm just drawing a blank right now.
It's not him, it's a her.
Francine Tenaka. And if you don't know who Tenaka is,
there's no reason you should know who Brad Petite is,
or that he's ambitious or a good guy.
This job offer came from you or the President.
And I'm telling you that it didn't.
Well, I'm turning it down.
You tell the President that
I'm ready to come back whenever he needs me.
I don't need training wheels.
I need you to work on Birch while you're here.
See if you can get that list of possible candidates.
I don't think putting him down the far end of the table's
put him in a very chatty mood.
Refrigeration. Are you talking about refrigeration?
No. Re-bridge nations.
We need to re-bridgenate
ourselves so we'll more trust each other.
Da? Yes.
Let's get these amendments out of committee.
Not all of them, just some of them.
The Speaker would go ballistic if I started meddling in the House.
Not if it means he's going to battle with the presumptive nominee.
He knows where his bread is buttered.
You shove your wife's recess appointment down my throat,
now you want my help?
I had to fill the post.
And you have a city full of career diplomats.
Her appointment was a slap in the Senate's face.
Let's not get hung up on appointments, all right?
Hector, whatever you want me to sign, I'll sign.
I will not hold a veto over your head.
You can veto whatever you want. Just helps our case in .
Excuse me.
Which is more intoxicating, this wine or Claire Underwood?
How often do you use that line?
  Not as often as you use yours.   Which line is that?
"Viktor, are you in love?"
President Descoteaux told me
you asked him the same thing when he was here.
I believe my husband quoted
a Russian author the night he gave that toast.
  Don't say, uh... Tolstoy?   Pushkin.
"A deception that elevates us
is dearer than a host of low truths."
He didn't make that toast.
  No, he didn't.   No, no.
Tell me, do you actually know your Pushkin,
or did you just study up before I arrived?
Does it really matter?
So, this is what he does?
He leaves the seduction to you.
Isn't there a... a word for that in English?
  For what?   "Pimping," Yes?
He's pimping you out.
How charming you are.
Thank you.
And you make a much better First Lady than ambassador,
from what my people tell me.
Only teasing.
More wine... for the ambassador.
Please.
I'm gonna have to go in a couple minutes.
Mr. President, my gift for you.
Best vodka in the world.
Osobaya Sayanskaya.
Solid gold.
Each one of these bottles is ,.
Now, a toast.
To friendship, to good food,
and to Leo Tolstoy, who said,
"If you want to be happy, be."
Drink!
Now... you sniff your bread.
Say "".
Then whistle.
Sniff your sleeve.
And... eat your pickle.  
Now, why we do all this?
No one knows.
Again!
Oh, no. Now, Mr. President.
Now, you, Mr. Vice President.
A toast!
Uh, to, uh... further cooperation
between our two countries and, uh... continued... uh...
Oh, hell. Here's how!
Again!
Now, you... Mrs. Underwood.
To President Petrov and his...
little pickle.
Drink!
Again!
 They only had the rhythm so 
 They started swaying to and fro 
 They didn't know just what to use 
 This is how the blues 
 Really began 
Mr. President, Why don't you come up and join me?
Oh, no, no, no.
  Come on.   It's your show.
I know you can sing. I know you can sing.
Come on.
All right, well, I almost... I almost know this song.
I'm not so sure. Uh, how's it go now?
They heard the breeze.
 They heard the breeze 
 Through the trees 
 Singin' weird melodies 
 And they made that 
 The start of the blues 
 And then they nursed it 
 And they rehearsed it 
 And they they gave out the news 
 That the Southland 
 Gave birth to the blues 
 That the Southland 
 Gave birth to the blues 
That's all I have.
Beautiful. Beautiful, Mr. President.
Now... now, Mr. Cincotti,
uh, you might not know this one.
But, um... it's easy to follow.
You have a C for me?
You offered vetoes for sale to Mendoze?
Bob, shh... the president's singing.
Is that why you sat him next to you?
Bob, as you said, the Republicans control Congress.
Any luck with Birch?
No list yet. I'll keep working him.
Where's Dr. Cooke?
He got called away to surgery.
Save it for Svetla.
That's not her name.
She looks like a Svetla.
Well, I don't think we can end the evening on a higher note,
so I want to thank you all for coming,
for the singing and the dancing and the vodka.
But most especially to my friend, Peter Cincotti.
Thank you.
Coming all the way here to the White House.
Thank you. Thank you! Thank you for a wonderful evening.
Wonderful. And thank you to you, Mr. Cincotti.
Thank you. Thank you.
Your motorcade is ready, Mr. President.
I'll walk you out.
But first, I want to show you something. Come with me.
  We'll be right down, Calista.   Yes, sir.
What if I get you transferred? To some other agency.
It doesn't matter who I work for. He'll find a way.
How much do you care about staying here?
  What, DC?   In this country.
I'd have been long gone if
they didn't put a travel lock on my passport.
So let's unlock it.
Is that something you can do? If I get you what you want?
I need to know exactly where she is.
Not a state. Not a city. An address.
If I use the Bureau's software and get caught,
I'll give them your name.
I understand.
All right.
Tell me everything you know about her.
Good night.
  How about a night cap?   Oh, it's late.
And I haven't had that much vodka since college.
Tulane, right?
So they tell me. It's all a bit of a blur.
What did you drink in school? Hurricanes?
Oh, we weren't barbarians. Scotch, no ice.
Two Chivas, neat.
Cubans. Smuggled in.
I thought you might appreciate the irony.
I do.
And where does this lead?
Basement entrance.
The Nixon kids would bring their dates up this way.
Kennedy probably used it for similar reasons.
Well, you know, now that I'm divorced,
I don't have to sneak anyone in and out of the palace.
They can come through the front door. With some dignity.
Well, dignity's a bit overrated for a mistress, don't you think?
You know, a woman like your wife, for example,
would certainly make it worthwhile.
Do you kiss the wife of every president you meet?
Not every president's wife looks like yours.
I'd push him down the stairs and light his broken body on fire
just to watch it burn,
if it wouldn't start a world war.
  May I?   Of course.
Well, do you think they'll ever come around?
Oh, I don't know.
There'll be more summits, a hundred CoDels.
They'll ping-pong back and forth for months
before Petrov shows his hand.
  What?   Nothing.
Tell me.
I was just picturing Bugakov playing ping-pong.
Bugayev?
Imagine him playing beer pong.
Then these negotiations would be over.
You are looking at the Delta Phi beer pong champion.
  No.   Yes.
Both sophomore and junior years.
And what happened senior year?
Well, I had to start studying for law school.
Well, I wasn't... a champion.
  I wasn't too bad, though.   You?
  I think we should play.   What?
  Oh, you can't be serious.   Excuse me?
Can you ask housekeeping to bring us some ping-pong balls, please?
I have got to go home.
We'll be playing by Harvard rules.
You have to admire their fearlessness.
None of them understand, do they?
What it takes to govern.
They scream and yell and stomp their feet,
but if they had to spend just one day in our shoes,
the weight we carry on our shoulders...
Like, um... the Middle East?
Oh, I know why we're here, smoking our cigars.
  And?   You're not going to like it.
Yes!
Drink up.
Okay. For the Crimson.
Damn!
Yes! I still got it.
You don't have to drink that.
I accept your mercy.
And I am going to leave before you challenge me to a rematch.
You're not even gonna give me a shot at winning in my own house?
stop while you're ahead,
which is what I should've done,
after that third vodka of Petrov's.
What do you think of him?
Petrov? I don't know.
You were the one who talked to him all night.
Well, I didn't have much of a choice.
So, not a fan?
I think he's very intelligent. And he has a charm.
That kiss was... too much.
No, that's just pushing buttons.
The Russians love to do that.
Good night.
I don't think he's to be trusted, Cathy.
Especially after tonight. And it made me think...
Go on.
It made me wonder about Francis' plan.
I'm not sure that it's a good idea to be partnered with Petrov.
In the meantime, we alienate Israel and Palestine.
Well... between you and me, I agree.
Sit with me.
What would you do differently?
Well...
If the goal is to get troops into the Jordan Valley,
well, then there's more than one way to skin that cat.
A multinational force?
I would go through the UN.
Peacekeeping?
You wouldn't get past Russia's veto.
There might be a way, but...
you'd have a lot of responsibility on your shoulders.
Well, if you can give me guidance, I'm sure I can handle it.
There is precedent with the Uniting for Peace Resolution.
We used it to get around the Russians for the Korean War.
  The whole thing?   From Poland to the UK.
I want the entire missile defense system gone.
You know that's there to defend against North Korea, against Iran.
And far closer to my borders than theirs.
I'm asking for a few thousand troops in the Jordan Valley.
You're asking me to dismantle Europe's defense system.
What you're really asking for is American forces
just south of the Caucasus.
You must have a strategic play in mind.
This is about stability in the region.
You're trying to consolidate your foothold in the region.
The Black Sea, Kazakhstan, Chechnya, Crimea.
So, please... don't insult me with peace.
Whatever your strategic goals may be,
the missile defense system is mine.
Viktor, I invited you to Washington with pure intentions,
so that we could break bread and learn to trust one another.
Francis, I don't get softened up
by a nice dinner and dancing with a beautiful woman.
You asked me what I want.
Well... I told you.
I'll tell you what.
It's my turn to get some sleep.
Let's attack all this with a fresh mind.
We've barely smoked our cigars.
We're not men of excess, though, are we?
Aren't we?
No, no.
No, you're right.
Enough smoke for one evening.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Try to meet him halfway.
Cathy and I were talking.
Maybe the Israelis and the Palestinians are right.
We should consider starting with them.
Use the United Nations to put pressure on Russia.
  How?   Uniting for Peace.
General Assembly overrides
a Russian veto in the Security Council.
Well, that'll just antagonize them even if it works.
And it won't.
Well, it might work. Cathy seems to think it could.
I thought you believed in this plan.
We were just... brainstorming alternatives.
Well, I've worked too hard on it just to abandon it.
Okay, you know best.
Do you mind?
What?
The light.
Francis.
He's a thug.
Smart, but he's still a thug.
Don't cower to him.
Where I come from,
we drop a raw egg into some tomato juice and drink that.
Luckily, I don't come from there.
That's a perfect job for Doug.
I can't imagine why he'd turn it down.
He thinks we were behind it.
I told him we weren't, but I don't think he believes me.
Said he doesn't need training wheels.
Well, I want you to still stop in from time to time and see him.
Yes, sir.
Is the Secretary of Defense here? Send him in.
  Mr. President.   We don't have much time.
Petrov gets here in  minutes. We need to talk Europe.
The answer is yes.
To some, not all, of what you asked.
I see.
I'm prepared to scale back significantly.
Now, I have to speak to my team first and my allies in NATO,
but I'm confident that we can do something meaningful
in Poland and the Czech Republic.
Now, our people can work out the specifics.
And whatever it is we decide and agree on,
the public cannot know.
I woke up with the taste of those cigars in my mouth.
Thinking of Cuba and Kennedy.
I won't be humiliated the way
Khrushchev was with Turkey.
Well, you can't possibly compare
what I'm proposing to what happened then.
I can only consider a partial scale-back
if you announce it.
This press conference is about the Jordan Valley.
The most important thing about the missiles is the scale-back,
not the PR.
My people would know I walked away with something.
And, by announcing it, I can keep you to your word.
I am more than meeting you halfway, Viktor.
You know what the best part of the Fall of the Soviet Union was?
The cars.
Have you ever been in, um... a Lada?
Lada? No, I haven't.
No? Oh. It's the worst car ever built.
Tiny, little thing, you know.
Your head would hit the ceiling when you hit a pothole.
And the heat never worked.
And no air conditioning.
You know, your skin would stick to the seats in the summer.
It was a coffin on wheels.
But then, after the Fall, we got the Lexus.
Temperature control. Automatic windows.
And so much room.
First time I fucked my ex-wife, in a Lexus.
You could never do that in a Lada.
No space.
You see, Mr. President.
I want the Lexus.
And you're trying to sell me a Lada.
I'll have them bring your motorcade around.
But the... press conference.
Right!
I'd completely forgotten.
But I think we're gonna be okay without one today.
Have a safe journey home, Mr. President.
Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. President.
Give me the Secretary of State.
The President will be speaking alone.
No joint conference.
The President will be out shortly.
Last night, I had the pleasure of hosting
some very special guests here at the White House.
True Russian patriots
who exhibit the very best that their country has to offer.
Nadya Tolokonnikova,
Masha Alyokhina and Pyotr Verzilov.
As you're all aware,
they stood up to President Petrov,
and forced him to listen to the truths that he didn't want to hear.
And, well, that had a profound effect on me.
Because it made me realize
that I need to stand up to him as well.
As does our country.
When I invited the President here,
I set out hoping to find a partner.
But the demands that President Petrov made proves to me
that peace is not a priority for him.
Peace should not have to be bought.
Peace should be its own reward,
and we will achieve it,
with or without him.
Thank you very much.
You have thoughts on how to bypass Russia.
The idea is to negate Russia's veto in the Security Council.
I'll let the Ambassador tell you what we have in mind.House.of.Cards.SE
Deference to the executive cannot possibly justify
the injuries to Mr. Mahmoud or the death of his family members.
If you do not say that this is wrong,
that this is unconstitutional,
there is nothing to prevent this
sort of senseless tragedy from happening again.
We ask for nothing more than reform and oversight.
Your ruling is a crucial first step.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Katyal.
Ms. Dunbar.
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court,
the security of American citizens is the reason our drone program
and other covert operations exist.
But that security often comes with a cost.
At this very moment, the president is at Arlington Cemetery,
laying to rest three Navy SEALs
who perished on a mountainside in Afghanistan.
They gave their lives to save others.
And God said to Abraham, "Take your son,,
your only son, whom you love, Isaac,
and sacrifice him."
Abraham was willing.
But when he raised his knife above Isaac on the altar,
God stopped him.
For Abraham had proven his devotion to God.
Then God, to prove his devotion to us,
made his own sacrifice.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son."
Devotion. Sacrifice.
Love.
This is what the Lord teaches us.
And what these young men have exemplified.
We shall forever honor them.
And in heaven, they will have eternal life.
Amen.
Ready, pull.
As you are aware, we have invoked the State secrets privilege
during our request for dismissal.
But I have authority from the president
to share some of the classified brief
in order to reinforce the government's argument.
Are you certain you want to do that, Ms. Dunbar?
I am, Mr. Chief Justice. And so is the president.
So the government is publicly admitting responsibility for the strike?
It is, Your Honor.
The terrorist successfully targeted was Zuri Aziz.
He routinely used civilians as human shields.
Mr. Mahmoud's family did not know Aziz was in the same building.
The drone strike is responsible for their deaths.
Mr. Mahmoud has suffered a terrible injury and loss.
While the government's action is tragic, it wasn't unlawful.
It was legal, it was necessary, and it was right.
Heather Dunbar? She's never run for office.
You don't become Solicitor
General without being politically savvy.
It takes more than savvy to be elected president.
Don't forget,
she has a national profile after the Walker investigation.
Truth and justice personified.
If the leadership wants to redefine the party, she's  
No one with this little experience,
has ever been a real contender since Ross Perot,
and at least he had the money.
So does she. Her family owns Dunbar Armored Cars.
She could finance her entire campaign if she needed to.
But what prevents the abuse of power?
The executive can't legislate, can't receive appropriations,
can't sentence people to imprisonment.
All of these depend on the other branches,
which keeps executive power in check.
But we know for a fact that, in emergencies,
the executive will contemplate actions
that do not have clear legislative authority
and might be constitutionally dubious.
Including  
Are you asking about drone strikes, Your Honor?
Yes. Drone strikes.
The fear of an out-of-control executive is exaggerated.
The president has strong electoral and other political incentives
to act in the public interest.
You yourself have investigated the White House for abuse of power.
It forced a president to resign.
Now you maintain that, uh,
we should give our president a wide berth?
I am not here to defend any one person,
but rather the office of the presidency itself.
We must hold everyone in government accountable to the law.
But we must not manufacture our interpretation of the law
to erode constitutional authority.
We can prosecute presidents, but not the presidency.
We have to assume this is happening.
We need to end her campaign before it begins.
She's clean.
Walker vetted her for Solicitor General,
then again when he made her special prosecutor.
That's one of the things that makes her so attractive.
Thank you, Jackie.
Yes, sir.
Well, if we can't knock her out,
we have to figure out another way.
It's something, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Traditionally, the United States has not supported
military action in the Middle East.
But a neutral UN peacekeeping force in the Jordan Valley
is an essential first step to sustainable,
long-term peace.
The United States will vote "yes."
Thank you, Mr. President.
I give the floor to the representative of the Russian Federation.
Russia is also committed to stability in the region.
But inserting the UN into such a complicated situation
could irrevocably damage the hopes of real peace.
I strongly encourage my colleagues
to not support this resolution.
Thank you, Mr. President.
With no further requests to speak,
I put the draft resolution to a vote.
All those in favor?
Those against?
Those abstaining?
The vote is  in favor, one against,
one abstention.
The draft resolution does not pass
due to the "No" Vote by a permanent member of the Security Council.
Ileana, France is in.
I need to be certain Israel will stand firm.
Israel will never maintain its commitment.
Israel wants what the rest of the world wants,
sustainable security.
Trust me on this,
I've dealt with Jerusalem for many years at the UN.
The moment it gets difficult, they'll turn their back on you.
And it will get difficult.
You're right.
I can't predict how they will act down the road,
but I do know they will vote for this resolution.
We'll see.
Going around the Security Council is a radical move.
It's not radical, it's justified.
You dust off some  year-old precedent
and think you're justified?
The Uniting for Peace resolution was used to start a war.
To end North Korea's aggression.
Semantics.
Ninety-three nations on board already,
including Israel, that's not semantics.
Claire, I'm getting a lot of pressure from the Kremlin.
Petrov doesn't want this to go to the General Assembly.
Give me a little more time to work on him.
We've given you a month. We're moving forward.
Yes?
Ms. Dunbar is here.
Send her in.
Heather.
Mr. President.
I listened to the audio of your defense this morning.
It was outstanding.
You were right about making the emotional argument.
I think it will help the country heal. Please, have a seat.
I'm also going to meet later tonight with Mr. Mahmoud privately.
To personally apologize.
That's a compassionate thing to do.
When I listened to your argument, I also heard something else.
There was a moment when Justice Jacobs
was asking you about drone strikes.
Yeah, I remember.
And he paused... for quite a long time.
I think... he just lost his train of thought.
Well...
What I'm about to tell you has to remain between us.
Of course.
Justice Jacobs has Alzheimer's.
He came to me a few months ago to tell me.
Now, it's in the early stages,
so you wouldn't even notice unless you know what to look for.
He wants to remain on the court?
Well, that's what I want to discuss.
He wanted to retire.
I asked him to hold on just a little while longer,
until I could find a suitable replacement and now I have.
And I want that replacement... to be you.
What do you think?
I'm... humbled, sir.
And... honestly surprised that you'd consider me.
Why is that?
Given our history.
When I said that was water under the bridge, I meant it.
You have the finest legal mind in this country,
a deep understanding of the Constitution,
and the Republicans wouldn't dare block your nomination.
After all, you prosecuted a Democratic president.
You're too good to be Solicitor General.
Let's make sure you have a job for life.
I appreciate you saying that, sir.
I'm sorry.
This is a lot to process.
It's important we do this before the election.
We could end up with a Republican president.
And I don't want to suggest your name to Jacobs
unless you truly want the position.
So... I need to know now.
Yes. It would be a great honor.
Good. Congratulations.
You speak to your family. I'll speak to Jacobs.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Did you see this?
See what?
I just got an alert.
I don't know. I haven't, uh... seen Jim in a while.
That's weird.
I want to offer you my sincerest regret.
And I hope that you will accept my apology.
I'm sorry, but I can't.
I know it should have come sooner.
There needs to be more oversight.
Well, there is congressional oversight.
We have a rigorous system to prevent collateral damage.
Civilians are listed as "other militants."
But the government offers no evidence that's true.
It definitely wasn't in my case.
How rigorous can your process be?
The numbers of non-combatants who are being killed by drone strikes
is lower than it's ever been.
Those numbers are false.
One civilian killed in ? That has to be wrong.
Look, I don't think the Pentagon is being honest about  
Are you okay?
I'll get the doctor up here.
Don't do that. It'll pass.
Phantom pain.
You know what I dreamed of when I came here?
Choking you with my bare hands.
Mr. Mahmoud, you may hate me.
You may hate the office I hold.
But here's the reality:
I must make decisions every day that I hope are just.
I don't know right from wrong all the time.
I wish I did.
But what I can't be is indecisive.
It says in the Qur'an: "The taking of one innocent life
is like the taking of all mankind."
It also says that "The saving of one life
is like the saving of all mankind."
You didn't ask me here to apologize.
You asked me here to forgive you.
I didn't order the strike that  
I won't forgive you, Mr. President.
I don't want to make it any easier for you to sleep at night.
And knowing a few lines of the Qur'an does not absolve you.
I have a duty to this nation, Mr. Mahmoud.
I swore an oath.
There's a fine line between duty and murder.
Only you have the power to stop what happened to me.
The next time you wield it... I hope you'll think twice.
Yes, of course. Meechum!
Yes, sir?
You show Mr. Mahmoud out.
Two months of random sampling across the country.
Less than a tenth of a percent of all incoming data.
Why so little?
You have any idea how many cameras we monitor?
The CPU core quota of every mainframe in Washington
couldn't handle all that data.
I tried doubling the sample range and it set off alarms.
I came this fucking close to getting caught.
Okay, we just need to narrow the search, man.
It's too much ground to cover.
How?
I need more information on Rachel.
Favorite books, fuckin' movies. Anything.
I don't know.
Come on. Did she ever talk about going anywhere?
Traveling to some place?
No. Traveling wasn't an option.
I need more, man.
What about the other girl? Lisa.
I'm reading her e-mails.
I'm tracking her phone. There's nothing there.
We should get close to her, though. We should talk to her.
Extract something.
She might recognize me.
I'll do it.
That makes me nervous.
It's social engineering. I'll just hack her that way.
She won't suspect a thing.
If we don't try something new, we're not gonna find Rachel.
Help yourself to some boiled peanuts.
No, thank you. Too much salt.
First week I was here,
I asked one of the stewards if I could have some boiled peanuts.
I used to eat them all the time as a kid,
and I'll be damned if there hasn't been
a full bowl of peanuts here every day since.
They must have a pot boiling 'round the clock.
Ruth has me eating kale crisps now.
Says they're good for me. I can't stand the things.
I have them shucked in the kitchen,
so you don't even have to get your fingers dirty.
Feel free. Live a little.
Mr. Justice, since we last spoke,
I've done a lot of soul searching.
It was unfair of me to ask you to stay on the bench.
If you want to retire, you should.
I appreciate your consideration, Mr. President.
Well, I thought the first thing I should do
is to find a suitable successor.
Someone you would approve of to put your mind at ease,
and I think I've found one.
Who?
Heather Dunbar.
I think she'd be an excellent justice.
I'm glad you agree.
Just an unlikely choice, given how vociferous she  
With the Walker investigation, yes.
But that only increases my estimation of her.
She has a great sense of duty.
More than any Solicitor General I've ever worked with.
I wish I'd known the reason you invited me beforehand.
I could have saved you the trouble.
Why?
After I talked to you a couple of months ago,
Ruth said you'd given me a gift.
That I would be miserable if I weren't on the bench.
She talked to my sons and they all agreed.
As long as I'm well enough to serve the court,
that's where I want to be.
And we'll keep an eye on .
If it looks as though the Republicans will win, I'll step down.
If not, I'll stay. But, there's no rush.
Must I destroy this man?
Mr. President?
No. I won't.
Excuse me?
I won't stand by
and watch you make this mistake.
I've thought this through.
We're not friends, Robert.
We don't know each other that well.
But I care about you.
Because you served for more than  years on the bench.
You've established legal precedents that will outlive both of us.
And...
maybe you can explain away yesterday as a senior moment.
But what if another moment happens that you can't explain away?
What if somehow the news of your illness leaks?
Then every decision you've written will be called into question.
They'll be challenged.
And a life's work will be undone in a heartbeat.
Do you have some ulterior motive here?
Only your best interests.
But why the urgency?
I want to protect you.
Justice, I'm asking you, I'm pleading with you.
Don't let events get out of your control.
Will you reconsider?
I appreciate your concern, Mr. President.
Let me speak again to Ruth and I'll get back to you.
Thank you, Justice.
It's a moratorium.
We're not calling it that.
Call it whatever you want, nobody's talking.
We're trying to prevent misinformation.
I'm supposed to write about AmWorks.
How can I do that when no one
from the executive branch will speak to me?
This thing's shifting under our feet in Congress.
By the time I finish the morning brief, it's already outdated.
I'm not asking for a one-on-one with the president, but...
the Secretary of Labor, Treasury,
one of his economic advisors.
Give you special treatment?
I think you issued the moratorium because you're losing the battle.
It's  billion dollars.
This is the largest jobs program since the New Deal.
Of course it's a slugfest. That doesn't mean we're losing.
Then let me speak to someone who can confirm that.
Because all I'm hearing from the Republicans is that
AmWorks will never see the light of day.
I sympathize with you, Ayla.
I wish I could give you what you want.
The president needs us.
So we'll talk later.
Michael Corrigan, the activist who organized the protest
at the state dinner last month,
arrested by Russian police three hours ago in Moscow.
The video is going viral.
He's a high profile gay rights activist, nationally and abroad.
And he's been very vocal in Russia over the last six weeks.
Here's the bureau file on him, sir.
Have we been in touch with the Kremlin?
Secretary Durant is in Tangier right now.
I briefed her by phone and she reached out to Bugayev.
But they have not connected yet.
Ambassador Grimes is making calls in Moscow,
but nobody's engaging,
other than to say they plan on fully prosecuting him.
Ambassador, do you think this could be in retaliation
for what you're doing at the UN?
It could be.
The Russians are very upset about this resolution.
I'll see what I can find out from Moryakov.
Let's hold off on the press conference until tomorrow.
I'd like to deliver some good news instead of no news.
In the meantime,
put out a statement that we're in communication with Moscow.
And that we're doing everything we can
to get Mr. Corrigan back to the United States. Thank you all.
Personally, I hate the law.
It's medieval homophobic nonsense.
But it's the law.
I don't think it's coincidence
that Corrigan was arrested after our conversation.
Well, I wouldn't think it was a coincidence either.
So what do you hope to achieve?
Mr. Corrigan's release.
If I withdraw the resolution.
I think Moscow would certainly see it as a sign of goodwill.
Well, we don't barter goodwill
for the freedom of American citizens.
I actually advocated for his immediate deportation.
I agree that tossing him in jail is counterproductive,
but my superiors are adamant.
Save Petrov from himself.
It's not my place to question him.
Unlike you, I'm not married to my boss.
I'll relay the Kremlin's position to the president.
If we give in, the Jordan Valley plan is over
and we show the Russians we can be blackmailed.
So we're just supposed to let Corrigan rot away?
I think if we continue to drive hard at the UN,
we'll gain leverage.
What does Cathy think?
She agrees.
I'm gonna take flak every day that Corrigan remains in jail.
And you'll take more if you back down.
But it does mean I have to get in front of the press
with absolutely nothing of substance to say.
You spent  years in Congress. You're good at that.
It's good to hear you laugh.
Get some sleep. I'll call you tomorrow.
Good night.
Who specifically is communicating between Washington and Moscow?
All of our communication is between the State Department
and the Russian Foreign Ministry. Ayla.
In your statement, you persisted in calling this a free speech issue,
but isn't gay rights really at the center of this?
Well, Mr. Corrigan was arrested for speaking his mind.
No matter what his opinions...
Aren't you skirting that, Mr. President,
because your stance on gay rights is unclear?
What is clear is that Mr. Corrigan's detainment is unjust
and, as I said, we're doing everything we can
to make sure that he can come home. Yes, Zachary.
Following up.
Isn't dodging gay rights a calculated move
for a man not running for office?
You think I'm dodging?
Well, then let me be as clear as I possibly can be.
Gay people have rights.
And this administration has always believed
that Mr. Corrigan has the right to speak his mind
without fear of being arrested on any issue,
whether it's gay rights or something else.
And what is also quite clear
is that you must have failed etiquette class.
Yes, Zachary.
  Mr. Prisident     Why won't you speak to John Pasternak,
  Michael Corrigan's husband?   Ms. Sayyad,
there are other members of the press here today,
Mr. Pasternak has been trying to contact the White House
and no one will speak with him.
I do apologize, I have a meeting.
I wish I could've gotten to all your questions.
But if you have any further inquiries,
please direct them to Mr. Grayson. Thank you very much.
I apologize, sir.
You went too far.
I did my job.
There's protocol. There's basic decorum.
you lift the moratorium for me on AmWorks,
I disappear for five weeks. Focus on my long-lead piece.
I don't touch Corrigan or anything else.
You wanted me to chew you out.
If that's what it takes to get us talking.
Which is why I need your credential.
  What?   Your credential.
  You're kidding.   Do you see me laughing?
You don't control my credential.
The Correspondents' Association does.
And I just spoke to Joel Weinmann.
He wouldn't.
You succeeded, Ayla.
I'm lifting the moratorium
for every other member of the press corps.
The price was your credential.
He has no grounds.
You disrespected the president,
the office, and most importantly, your fellow colleagues.
It wasn't a tough sell.
Then this becomes my next story.
Punishing a member of the press. Collusion. Pay for play.
And I'll deny.
And do you think the head of the association
is gonna admit anything?
You don't have any friends, Ayla, on either side of the fence.
The president just made a statement about free speech.
Now you're gonna start kicking reporters out of the White House?
  No. Just you.   No, not just me!
You're fucking with the second largest daily in America.
You can get rid of me,
but you can't get rid of the institution I work for.
You done?
Don't let your  minutes of power go to your head, Seth.
You can keep the plastic if you want... as a souvenir.
That's all it's good for, now.
Hello?
Yeah.
Are you serious?
Okay.
Fuck.
I need to speak to the president.
Through our laws, we seek to create a more perfect union.
Government officials who abuse the law,
or, at the very least,
exploit the edges of it for their own personal gain,
tarnish our democracy and weaken the bonds of our great nation.
The Democratic Party must step out of the shadow of scandal
and redefine itself.
I want her here when she's done with this stunt.
Embracing a new era of transparency, honesty and justice,
this country deserves a president who has dedicated herself
to those ideals in this court and many others,
who has spent her entire life defending the law,
and who now wants to dedicate herself to enforcing it.
Let's restore integrity to the Oval Office.
Use its power to root out corruption and lead by example.
Today, before my family and friends,
my God, and the highest court in our land,
I announce my candidacy
for President of the United States of America.
There was no indication Ms. Dunbar
had plans to run for president.
This will make her the second Solicitor General
in history to run for president,
the only other being William Howard Taft in .
With President Underwood declaring he will not  
  Mr. President.   Ms. Dunbar.
Please, take a seat.
My letter of resignation.
I can't accept that.
You're too valuable to us.
I can't run for office as Solicitor General.
Then you should reconsider running for office.
It's too late for that, I think.
I don't understand, Heather.
I offered you a seat on the Supreme Court.
If Jacobs was stepping down, which he isn't.
You spoke to him.
As Solicitor General, I'm friendly with all the justices.
I keep those relationships private
so no one will suspect any bias toward me.
But Robert and I are very close.
He and Ruth have me over for dinner once a month.
So you already knew about the Alzheimer's?
He told me the day he was diagnosed.
I've never had anything but his best interests at heart.
You don't care about Robert.
You wanted to sideline me.
So you actually think you have a shot at this office?
Yes, I do. And so does the leadership.
You're in over your head, Heather,
no matter what Birch and Womack are telling you.
Why should it concern you, Mr. President?
You've announced that you're not running.
Is this personal for you?
Don't flatter yourself.
You got Walker, but you couldn't get me.
I don't have to run to make sure you leave office.
You couldn't win anyway.
I'm running because I know I'd make a good president.
You might very well make a good president.
But right now, you're being delusional.
When Birch approached me, I wasn't sure.
I was tempted, but I knew it was a long shot.
And when you offered the nomination, I was overwhelmed.
It's what I'd been working toward my entire career.
But then I spoke to Robert.
And when he told me how you threatened him,
I knew I had to run.
Someone needs to scrub the stink from this office.
I didn't threaten him.
What would you call it?
I was trying to save him,
in the same way I'm trying to save you now.
Once the news of his Alzheimer's gets out, which it will,
because no matter how much we all try to lie about it,
it's gonna leak,
can you imagine what that's going to do to his reputation?
He deserves better than that.
And you deserve better than being an also-ran.
Help me convince him.
Take the seat on the court where you belong.
Is this how you live with yourself?
By rationalizing the obscene into the palatable?
I haven't excused you yet.
See you in Iowa.
I wouldn't have made it
through the past eight months without my faith.
But I wouldn't have made it without this community, either.
And on tough days...
I remind myself of that.
That I'm not alone.
That I have all of you.
And I think it's important to acknowledge that.
To give thanks.
So thank you.
All of you.
For always being there. For always being here.
I have to go. I'll see you soon.
I just wanted to say, what you said...
it really connected with me. About community.
  Thank you.   Yeah.
I'm glad.
I'm Lisa.
Of course. Max.
You're new.
It was my first time, actually.
Do you live around here?
Towson. Just drove up.
How did you find out about us?
Online.
Website.
Yeah, I was surfing around, and I was...
I was looking for something and...
  It's stupid.   No. No, no.
Tell me.
Okay, well, a few months ago, this girl...
the love of my life, actually...
Breakup?
She just left me.
Out of the blue.
You know, one day she just said it was over and that was it.
Yeah.
That's hard.
I went through something similar not that long ago.
Oh, really?
Sort of what I was talking about tonight
with the hard time I had been through.
What happened?
Ancient history.
A guy left you?
It was a woman.
I guess I'm not completely over it, but time heals, you know?
I gotta get home, but it was nice to meet you, Max.
Nice meeting you, Lisa.
Can we reschedule? Let me see.
Yeah, yeah. Can you move that up by a half an hour?
Hello?
Is this a good time, Ms. Dunbar?
Who is this?
Doug Stamper.
How did you get this number?
Phone numbers are easy. What you should be asking
is how I knew you were meeting with Senator Giallo tonight.
Look down the hallway.
Go ahead. I'll meet you down there.
All right.
No. Stay where you are.
We wouldn't want to be seen together.
Did the president send you?
No. He and I aren't in touch.
Then why are you here?
You're forming your team. I want to be a part of it.
The real reason.
That is the reason.
He sent you. Don't lie to me.
I've been out of the game for nine months, Ms. Dunbar.
I want to get back in.
You're forming your team,
and I want to get in on the ground floor.
The leadership isn't enough.
You need the rank and file.
Their connections to county and municipal power brokers.
The chiefs of a thousand kingdoms
in every primary from Iowa to Super Tuesday.
I worked in the whip's office for ten years.
I have files on every single member.
What they want, who they sleep with, what they eat for lunch.
I can be valuable to you.
How did you know I was meeting with Giallo tonight?
You rub shoulders with the leadership.
I rub shoulders with the people who work for them.
Think about it, Ms. Dunbar. That's all I ask.
Going down.
I made a mistake.
I mean, the way she spoke to me in the Oval,
I wanted to strangle her.
I mean, what is she thinking?
Running against an incumbent
when I offered her a seat on the court  
She was going to run the moment Birch whispered in her ear.
Once people imagine themselves in the Oval,
there's no turning back.
You know that as well as anybody.
It's my own damn fault. Shouldn't have given Jacobs the choice.
I should've just announced her nomination before I even asked her.
  Should I come home?   No.
I just need to think. I need to clear my head.
Tell me what I can do.
Why did I hold back?
Why did I show Jacobs any mercy?
Francis, this doesn't sound like you.
Put this behind you. Think about what's next.
It was because of Mahmoud.
I let him get to me.
And all those flags on those coffins and those soldiers, whose  
I deployed and then I buried in the ground. It's my  
Stop it. This isn't doing you any good.
I will talk about this with you if you want,
but if you're doubting yourself, I can't indulge that.
No, you're right, of course.
Well, let's talk in the morning.
  I'm here if you need me.   I know.
  Good night.   Good night, Francis.
Yes, can you reach out to Bishop Eddis for me?
I'll hold.
Thank you, Meechum.
  If we can have some privacy.   Yes, sir.
Still riding the Bonneville?
Sold the ' for a Pipeburn. Beautiful bike.
You should take me for a spin sometime.
I don't think so.
They're a death wish.
At least you know you have a place in heaven.
What's on your mind, Mr. President?
The burial the other day.
You talked about Abraham and Isaac.
God giving up his only Son.
Between you and me,
that's the same sermon I always use at Arlington.
You put enough soldiers in the ground,
you get tired of writing new ones.
It was the first time I had heard it.
Won't be the last.
I want to understand what justice is.
That's a big one.
I know.
There's our justice, the kind men create.
We base it on things like the Ten Commandments.
But those can be read a million different ways.
"Thou shalt not kill" seems pretty clear.
Who's to say? If we didn't kill,
others would kill instead of us.
There's a lot of killing in the Bible.
King David was a warrior.
How do you reconcile that with the laws that God gave Moses?
Even those laws require interpretation.
There are two laws we have to remember above all else.
He tells us to love God
and to love each other.
You can't love the people you kill.
You sure as hell can.
And you have to love the people who are trying to kill you.
Jesus loved the Romans.
"Father, forgive them," He said,
"For they know not what they do."
Why didn't he fight?
Why did he allow himself to be sacrificed?
I ask myself that question a lot.
I understand the Old Testament God,
whose power is absolute,
who rules through fear, but... him.
There's no such thing as absolute power for us,
except on the receiving end.
Using fear will get you nowhere.
It's not your job to determine what's just.
It's not your place to choose the version of God you like best.
It's not your duty to serve this country alone,
and it better not be your goal to simply serve yourself.
You serve the Lord.
And through Him, you serve others.
Two rules.
Love God. Love each other.
Period.
You weren't chosen, Mr. President.
Only he was.
May I have a few moments?
For myself. To pray.
It's all yours.
Love?
That's what you're selling?
Well, I don't buy it.
Is everything all right, sir?
I was praying and it just fell.
Please have someone clean this up.
Yes, sir.
Well, I've got God's ear now.House.of.Cards.SE
"Title One of the Stafford Act:
'Emergency' means any occasion or instance for which,
in the determination of the president..."
"Determined" by the president.
  Any instance?   As long as we can make the argument
that this saves lives and protects health and safety.
Well, unemployment leads to crime,
to malnutrition, to improper medical care.
There's no doubt it'll be challenged in the courts.
Well, even so, by the time that happens,
people will see what America Works looks like.
Tell me, in your legal opinion...
is there enough leeway here?
Yes, the language is sufficiently vague.
But just to be clear, this is completely unorthodox.
No president has ever tried to reappropriate funds this way.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all I need.
The states won't go for this. Too radical.
And if I call just one governor
who says no and leaks it to the press,
Congress will be on my ass before I get this out of the gates.
But, the District of Columbia...
  No governor.   Just you, the mayor.
Now, Barney, I know this puts you out on a ledge.
I love it. I love everything about it.
We have to fight Congress for every dollar in our budget, each year.
If my people see me take the money they won't give us...
well, I just won reelection.
This is why you put a brawler like Barney Hull in office,
aside from paying a debt.
Add up  governors and  members of Congress,
you don't come close to the gumption of one bold mayor.
I want people registering for jobs in every part of the city
as soon as possible, before the court challenges bubble up.
What about one big tent right in front of the Capitol?
Make Congress see the people
line up all the way back to the Lincoln Memorial.
Can we do something by July Fourth?
You bring the fireworks, I'll bring the people.
Good morning. Please, sit.
I know Remy has just briefed you all,
so, aside from the Secretary of Homeland Security,
who is no longer with us, does anyone else object to this plan?
Good. Until a new secretary is confirmed,
FEMA will report directly to me. Thank you all very much.
Unemployment doesn't
constitute a natural disaster, Mr. President.
The Stafford Act gives me full authority
to define an emergency.
But, sir, we've only got about three billion left
in the Disaster Relief Fund,
and we're about to go into hurricane season.
So we use the three billion that's there,
and if a hurricane hits,
Congress replenishes the funds, just as they always do.
When it comes to a disaster, every hour counts, sir.
If we're waiting around for Congress  
Mr. Silva, this is moving forward.
People could die, Mr. President.
People are dying because they don't have jobs.
Slower than a flood or an earthquake, but dying just the same.
You can't compare unemployment to a cat four hurricane.
I came to your office
because I want this to remain your office.
There's a reason three presidents have kept you here.
You're dedicated, you're relentless,
you're exceptionally competent.
If we have to stretch dollars even further,
you're the man to do it.
It's either you or someone far less experienced.
The two of you head to Iowa at the end of the week.
That's right. Eighteen counties this trip.
By January, I plan on hitting all .
John will join me at every event until his husband is released.
Have you had any contact with Michael since his arrest?
The Russian government has refused.
They won't let him speak to a lawyer.
That's why it's important John join me.
We need to keep the pressure up on Moscow.
You know, gay rights is controversial
in many parts of the country.
Do you think that appearing with Corrigan's husband
could possibly hurt you?
I think the American people want a candidate who doesn't dodge,
who is truthful about where she stands.
Not someone who shies away from controversy.
It's one thing to shy away from controversy.
It's another thing to court it.
Well, Michael was arrested for speaking his mind.
If defending free speech is controversial, then...
we're no better than Russia.
I wish that there were
more people in our government defending it.
Are you talking specifically about the Underwood Administration?
I think the president could do more.
You know, the White House has said hat they've been speaking
directly with the Kremlin, that they, and I quote here:
"Have to tackle this issue as it relates to the larger
diplomatic relationship between the two nations."
Then why haven't we seen any evidence of those talks?
When I'm president, the American people can rest assured
that I will take my oath
to defend and protect our citizens seriously.
  What do you think of her?   What, Dunbar?
Yeah.
I believe that the administration could do better...
  You worked for Underwood.   Not anymore.
I won't be offended.
Uh, I like a lot about what she has to say.
Would you vote for her?
I don't know. I might.
Yeah. Probably would.
  How soon?   Tomorrow.
We're gonna get hit hard on this.
Better than getting hit on Corrigan.
You saw Vieira?
Dunbar's smart.
She's running against us before we're even running.
She'll attack us on the FEMA thing, too.
Then let her. At least we're controlling the narrative.
When we first spoke, you mentioned early fall.
Look, Dunbar's got momentum because no one's challenging her.
But once we drop the FEMA plan,
that'll take her off message.
And your candidacy will distract her. It's a one-two punch.
We'll start bleeding away the woman's vote.
I'm just not sure how smart it is to rush into a campaign
  with so little preparation.   This isn't a real campaign.
But it needs to look like one.
I thought you wanted to be on my ticket.
It's my reputation at stake.
  I don't want to look foolhardy.   Look, no one  
Mayor's announcing in the morning.
Seth's working with his office.
You see, Jackie, this is perfect timing.
The FEMA plan goes into action,
you announce in a couple of weeks, you say you had to run.
President Underwood is being reckless with FEMA.
You come out against me
and America Works and you steal Dunbar's thunder.
And then I flip-flop
when I pull out and you put me on the ticket?
By then, , people will have jobs,
and it won't look like a flip-flop.
It'll look like you saw the light.
Now, look, why don't you go off with Remy
and you discuss the details,
and just give it some thought before you decide.
  Thank you, Mr. President.   Let's talk in my office.
My biggest concern is funding.
I couldn't fly coach to Iowa.
I'll get you some PAC money rolling your way.
Should be enough to get you started.
If I run, it shouldn't be half-ass.
Which is why we should talk about this.
You want a candidate with a family.
We are after the woman's vote.
Alan and I have already talked about it.
You have?
Yeah. We joked about getting married on our first date.
I get two kids without the stretch marks.
And when I mentioned I might run, it stopped becoming a joke.
Is Alan open to it?
  It was his idea.   And what about you?
We do love each other.
He seems like a good guy.
He is. And his children are wonderful.
You should think about getting hitched.
Should we talk timeline?
  For marriage?   The campaign.
This is far from an offer. This is a conversation.
And it's a conversation that never happened.
I took the back door in, I'll take the back door out.
We keep you off the payroll this quarter.
You start officially September th.
Next quarter's FEC filings. It's fine.
What are you thinking in terms of salary?
Twenty-two thousand per quarter.
That's way below what I'm worth. Even in this state.
What do you think's appropriate?
Two-fifty and three points on the ad-buy.
  That's beyond our means.   No, it's not.
It's a drop in the bucket from your estate.
You said you wanted in because you believed in this campaign.
  That's right.   Sounds like it's more about money.
It's about being valued. Two-fifty and the points is a bargain.
I want to work for you, just not as a beggar.
We don't trust you yet, Doug.
We don't even halfway trust you, so you are a beggar.
And you shouldn't trust me... until I prove myself.
That's a gamble you don't get to take
without putting chips on the table.
Cynthia and I will discuss.
Thank you for your time.
Let me check first.
Okay, it's clear.
  What do you think?   Why take the gamble?
I don't want us to start making decisions
from a position of weakness. That is how you lose.
I think we're inviting the fox into the hen house.
Anyone who wants to be a mole
accepts the first offer without question.
He's negotiating.
So you actually believe him?
Not necessarily.
But that doesn't mean that he doesn't have value.
Yeah, we're not gonna need any of these.
We're gonna keep these right here.
Kate Baldwin, the one and only.
I thought I heard somebody in here.
Welcome to the White House. Or welcome back, I should say.
It feels smaller than I remember.
  Where do they have you sitting?   Right there, second row.
I would've thought you wanted first row.
I heard you spit when you talk.
What's the president speaking about tomorrow?
  You don't waste a minute, do you?   No.
I gotta say, I was surprised
that the Telegraph sent you to cover the White House.
I mean, who leaves the London bureau?
Ayla was a protge of mine.
I see, so now they bring in the big guns.
Just one gun, but big enough.
  Don't get any ideas.   About what?
This is gonna stay around my neck.
You can't boot two reporters in a row from the Telegraph.
  Certainly not two women.   I have no desire to do that.
It's an honor to work with you.
Pulitzer, Peabody.
Get yourself a Nobel, you'll have a trifecta.
Oh, you're almost charming.
Kate, I'm not your enemy here.
You punished Ayla for doing good work.
She hit hard and you hit back. Fair enough.
Well, I'm gonna hit twice as hard as she ever did
because I can and because someone should.
I look forward to it.
You're such a terrible liar. I'll see you bright and early.
You got a minute?
Sure.
Here's the draft for the statement tomorrow.
I want it to be perfect.
Congress will fire back, all guns blazing,
and I'm sure Dunbar will make a meal and a half out of it.
But I gotta say, I feel good. To be on the offensive.
If I can't scrape the money together behind the scenes,
I'll rob the bank in broad goddamn daylight.
We'll cram America Works down their throats and watch them choke.
Enough tiptoeing.
Here.
Oh, these changes are good.
It makes me happy to see you excited.
I feel free again.
  I wish I felt the same.   The resolution?
Just some last minute hand-holding, but...
I think we'll get there.
I have complete confidence in you.
  Do you like this room?   It's fine.
You know, I haven't spent the night here yet.
  Maybe I could     My plane leaves at seven.
I should probably get some sleep.
You watch the news tomorrow. Should be fun.
  I will.   Good night.
Seventeen years, I served the Metro Police.
I've seen robberies and murders.
I've seen the blight of drugs.
I've seen little kids
whose only meal each day was the one they get at school.
You know what's at the root of all that?
Folks don't have jobs!
There are , unemployed people in Washington.
It's a disaster.
And it's a disgrace here in the nation's capital.
So this morning, at the president's urging,
I am declaring a state of emergency in the District of Columbia.
And I am formally requesting three billion dollars
from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund to put people back to work.
Motherfucker.
Anyone, and I mean anyone,
who registers for work in the District of Columbia
will be guaranteed a job.
I'm working with my cabinet to increase
workforce devoted to infrastructure, maintenance and repair.
The Defense Department
will ramp up recruitment and civilian employment.
And any private sector companies who hire AmWorks registrants
will get up to  , toward the yearly salary
of each job that they create.
Our goal is full employment within twelve months.
Our hope is that success in Washington
will convince Congress to fund America Works nationwide.
Now, I'll take a few questions.
Mr. President!
Madam Ambassador. A word, please.
Excuse me.
We are withdrawing support of the peacekeeping resolution.
  Why?   Because Israel is.
Palestine is open to the plan, but without consensus...
This came directly from Jerusalem?
  Yes, the foreign minister.   Nothing came from Eliana?
No, but I came to speak to her.
I'll speak to her myself. Thank you, Hasan.
Thank you, Ambassador.
Moscow is threatening to sell arms to Iran.
They always make that threat.
The feeling in Jerusalem is that this resolution
may push them over the edge. It's not worth the risk.
Why didn't you come to me? The vote's in two hours.
I got the call  minutes ago.
Russia doesn't want to be humiliated
because we did this without them.
You know it's a bluff on their part.
The prime minister feels that this vote is just symbolic.
That the US won't actually contribute troops.
No, we will absolutely follow through once it's passed.
The prime minister has his doubts.
I'm sorry, it's out of my hands.
Claire?
Ambassadors, I need you to withdraw the resolution.
We lost consensus.
I need to postpone the vote until we get it back.
Secretary Travers is a good example.
Homeland Security?
  Former secretary, I should say.   He's done?
They haven't announced, but Steve called me.
Said he stood up to the president on this FEMA nonsense.
Homeland Security has jurisdiction over FEMA now.
Right.
The president demanded his letter of resignation right then and there.
  This is all off the record.   Yeah.
  Paul's got a big mouth.   So it's true?
  This is off the record?   Completely.
Let me call you on my encrypted phone.
My number is blocked, so  
This is Homeland Security. I have your number.
Incoming call. Press the pickup bu  
  Mr. Secretary.   It's true. I resigned.
Why are you still in the office?
Punching the clock until the White House wants to go public.
Why wouldn't you go public yourself,
if you're so against the policy?
I serve at the pleasure of the president.
I have Landry on background.
I'm writing about the resignation.
And I can't stop you. But there won't be a quote from me.
Don't let the administration off the hook.
This an opportunity to speak out.
You don't have the career I've had
by criticizing your bosses publicly,
no matter how strongly you feel.
Talk to Arnie Silva, the FEMA Administrator.
He's more disgusted by all this than I am.
People's lives are in the balance. And he doesn't care.
Our projections for the next  months.
We're in a La Nia phase,
which means falling temperatures in the Pacific.
We expect at least two major landfalls this season.
Homes destroyed, billions in damage,
tens of thousands without power.
And that's just hurricanes. If we get a major earthquake,
or flood, or forest fire...
It's all in there.
Has he asked you to resign?
He threatened it.
But I said I'd cooperate.
Why?
Nobody has more experience.
I couldn't forgive myself if I left.
But you just said, if the Relief Fund is depleted, then  
People will suffer.
But on my watch, fewer will suffer.
I need a quote, Mr. Silva.
I can't do that.
People could die, you have a responsibility.
The president has built a culture of silence and fear.
That can end with you.
That folder will speak louder than anything I could say.
Two front page bylines on the same day for Ms. Baldwin?
You kicked out a pit bull and you let in a dragon.
I didn't think the Telegraph would send someone like her.
Well, maybe you just didn't think.
You wanted me to implement discipline, sir.
To send a message. And so I did.
Well, they've sent back an even stronger message, haven't they?
I take responsibility for that, sir,
and I will do my best to keep her in line.
Your best?
It's their top bureau chief. She's untouchable.
I don't want to pretend that I can control her  percent.
  Travers?   Denied speaking with her,
but it must be him.
I don't think anybody else in the cabinet would.
Let's confirm his resignation.
No point in keeping it a secret now.
Tell Steve he can vacate his office.
And what about Silva?
The details on the disaster projections are very inside baseball.
We can't fire him! If there's a hurricane,
he's the only guy that can keep a disaster from becoming a catastrophe.
  And what's Dunbar saying?   Nothing yet, publicly.
She's probably letting this play out.
Letting me dig my own grave.
We have to sell America Works.
It should sell itself once we get people employed.
Well, that's the idea, but we don't stop there.
  Commercials and billboards?   On whose money?
And even so, we need more than ad-buys.
We need... We need the philosophy behind it.
We need something of substance. We need something...
We need something that will capture the imagination.
  Either of you play Monument Valley?   What's that?
  It's a video game.   I don't play them, sir.
I sold my Xbox on eBay. It was too addictive.
No, it's not a console game.
You both read this
and then tell me that you wouldn't want to play this.
I'd say there's nine consultants in the country
who truly know foreign policy.
Me, I'm number one.
Me in a coma is number two.
But that still leaves seven who are cheaper.
I value good counsel,
and I'm smart enough to know what I don't know.
What would be your assessment of us so far?
You're making a big stink out of this Michael Corrigan thing,
but that's just surface.
You have to understand why Corrigan got arrested.
Petrov's appealing to his traditional base.
No. This is about the Jordan Valley.
I don't follow.
Retaliation.
It goes back to the summit a couple of months ago.
Look, this... is the Jordan Valley.
All right, hold on, I'll make it easier.
That's the Valley. Right there.
Occupied by Israel since ,
it's been a major roadblock in any peace accord with the Palestinians.
Underwood sends peacekeeping troops, the Israelis leave,
  the Palestinians are happy.   It's not that simple.
Everyone gets hung up on this little patch of land ten miles by ,
but you have to look outwards,
past Jordan and Syria, past Iraq.
Here... to the Caucasus.
That's Russia's sphere of influence.
They don't see the peacekeeping force as a Middle East issue.
They see it as strategic deployment of US troops
less than a thousand miles from their southern border.
So you're saying Corrigan's a pawn, a play for leverage?
More of a first salvo.
Moscow wants to show it's serious about fighting this resolution.
Now, if I had to guess,
Underwood tried to bring Russia into the mix during the summit.
Get involved early on as partners.
And when Petrov didn't play ball,
Underwood went on the offensive, which is a huge gamble.
  Tell me how.   Nobody wants UN troops there.
Not the Israelis, not the Palestinians,
not the Arabs.
They're playing along because the US is pressuring them.
But just one little thing needs to go wrong,
and you've got a tinderbox where everyone's holding matches.
So why is he following this course of action at all?
Because he's smart.
  You just said     He's being too smart.
If it pays off, hey, he wins a Nobel Prize. But...
if it backfires, he leaves himself wide open.
And that's when you need to hit him hard.
A disastrous foreign policy that made the world more dangerous.
And he had his wife with zero foreign policy experience
  lead the goddamn charge.   I'd like to bring you aboard, Joe.
  When can you start?   I believe I already did.
I'll get the paperwork over to you later today.
Let me ask, who referred me?
  You have quite a reputation.   Yeah, for being an asshole.
Somebody you respect must have recommended me highly.
A former Underwood staffer.
I never worked with any of his people.
Which is one of the reasons he recommended you.
Touch.
What is this?
A list of the Russian officials who will be sanctioned
if you sell a single truckload of arms to Iran.
I didn't even make the top ten.
These sanctions can and will escalate.
And then what?
We'd build a coalition to impose their own sanctions.
And then what?
Alexi,
you know what an economic crisis that would be for Russia.
Like the trade war you waged with China?
Except in our case, only three percent of exports go to the US.
And Europe needs our natural gas.
They won't forfeit that over a few short-range missiles to Iran.
You don't want to challenge us
on the armament of a terrorist state.
We'll never be presented with that problem.
You can't assure the Israelis you'll provide troops.
The President doesn't have the support of either party in Congress.
No troops, no Israel.
No Israel, no consensus.
No consensus, no resolution.
I will get this resolution passed.
Don't underestimate my ability or desire to do so.
I've indulged your enthusiasm long enough.
You've bit off more than you can chew, Claire.
Leave this to the professionals
and let your little resolution die a painless death.
The truth is, you have no business being ambassador
any more than I do being First Lady.
That's a very nice dress, by the way.
"She stabbed the floor with a broom.
Karaoke every Wednesday.
Some tone-deaf drunk girl mutilating Britney Spears.
She knew they couldn't hear the broom in the bar below.
But we all need a ritual, and this was hers.
Three short thrusts, wood on wood,
a hollow sound which accomplished nothing.
David would be home soon.
'It's too hot,' he'd say. She opened the window.
The music was so loud, she couldn't ignore it."
Here.
Aren't you gonna buy the new one?
I will, on my Kindle. But will you please sign this?
  Who should I make it out to?   Lesley. L-E-S-L-E-Y.
Scorpio totally changed my life.
The energy and the anger... It's my favorite book of yours.
Probably my favorite book, period.
  Make sure you read the new one.   Yes.
Who should I make it out to?
It's a perversion of the Stafford Act and you know it.
It's a reading of the Stafford Act. We read it differently.
You can't just raid funds
that Congress appropriated for a specific use,
  then use them however you want.   Clearly, I can.
This is a direct challenge to Congress, Mr. President.
Bob and I have agreed.
Both parties will fight you on this.
Well, at least I'm cultivating bipartisanship.
Gentlemen, I don't want to do this,
but what choice have you left me?
Our branch is here to check yours.
If we didn't feel America Works
warranted taxpayer money,
  then it's not fit to be law.   Now, look.
This is the first time that the leaders of both parties
have met with me in one room,
and not because I didn't invite you, because you declined.
So, now that we're here, let's make the most of it.
I'm willing to walk back on FEMA
if we can discuss putting AmWorks on the floor.
You bullied us on the Education Bill.
And the government freeze.
It's not gonna work this time.
You watch it work and then tell me it didn't.
We're drafting a law, saying this use of the DRF is illegal.
And who's going to enforce that law?
We were ready to impeach one president.
We'll do the same with you if necessary.
And put Donald Blythe in this office?
You know he's not up for the job.
Congress would get killed for malpractice.
As crooked as you may think I am,
you know I can handle the pressure, and you know Donald can't.
So pass your law, I'll veto it.
And when you overrule me in the Senate,
we'll let the third branch decide.
Don't declare war on Congress, Mr. President.
Not on Congress. I'm declaring war on atrophy.
But these days, who could tell the difference?
So how about this?
I'll order a pizza.
When it gets here, I bring it into this room...
with a paper towel draped over my arm.
Voil. Just like... room service.
You don't let your kids eat pizza.
Well, because I've seen what it does to a carotid artery.
And you're not my kids.
Do you think they like me?
They adore you.
Matt asked if you could teach him how to drive.
  Really?   Yeah.
He says you'd be less judgmental.
Do you want to get married?
To you, or in general?
I'm serious.
So where'd this come from?
We've talked about it.
We say "I love you."
I want a husband. You want a wife.
This works, the two of us, don't you think?
  It's very romantic.   Aren't we past romance?
I bought you a ring.
Why didn't you say anything?
It's the element of surprise.
That's kind of the point, isn't it?
It's in my glove compartment. I can go get it if you want.
No, I want you to order the pizza.
We can do the whole ring thing tomorrow.
When did you get in?
  Couple of hours ago.   Well, come and sit down.
I feel like I haven't seen you for what, has it been three days?
Four, I think.
It's just all been a big blur.
Same in New York.
Any luck?
They're like a broken record, Francis.
Do I need to call the prime minister?
Oh, I think it's gonna take more than a phone call.
  Tell me.   That's not why I'm here, actually.
So much has been going on in the past few months,
we hardly have time to talk.
Here, use this.
I feel bad about the other night
when you wanted to sleep in my bed.
Oh, that. You shouldn't.
I just  
I don't know why I started sleeping in there.
Well, if I remember correctly, you had a cold.
But why I stayed.
You don't have to explain.
I want you to know that I love you.
It has nothing to do with that.
I love you... as much as ever.
Not another word.
Let's finish talking about Israel in the morning.
You said more than a phone call?
They need it in stone, Francis, that we'll contribute troops.
  An executive order.   Congress won't be happy.
Well, they're already not happy.
I spat in one eye, I might as well spit in the other.
Consider it done.
Thank you. Thank you for your support.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you. Oh, sure.
Did you get it?
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you for your support.
Thank you, sir.
I liked your speech, Ms. Dunbar.
And I've heard more than a few.
I appreciate you saying that, sir.
I know Iowans aren't easily impressed.
What you said about integrity?
Well, if you can bring that to Washington,
I'll caucus for you.
One supporter at a time. That's how we'll win this.
And that young man? I feel for him. He's an inspiring individual.
John, there's someone I want you to meet.
  Your name, sir?   Clive Reynolds.
  Mr. Reynolds, nice to meet you.   I'm praying for your husband.
It's awful he's still stuck there.
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.
  Thank you.   Thank you.
Thank you for your support. Thank you for coming out.
You could've just called.
I hate July Fourth in DC.
Plus, I wanted to see you in action.
What'd you think?
I need her to leave.
I'll meet you at the car.
  Heather     Cynthia.
Read that.
Mrs. Underwood asked me to destroy it.
  I didn't.   You should have.
She lied on national television.
I am not running that sort of campaign.
But it's good to know it's available.
I would never do that to another woman,
and neither would Cynthia.
Cynthia was a good choice for your manager.
She'll run a top-notch operation.
But you need someone who's willing to do the things
that people like her won't do.
When you asked me for a job,
you said you wanted to turn over a new leaf.
I have a certain skill set, Ms. Dunbar.
For me, turning over a new leaf
is using my skills for the right reasons.
Like putting you in office.
One-fifty. One point on the ad-buy.
No points.
But I'll do a hundred thousand win bonus
if we get the nomination.
I hope I came over here for some good news.
I'm in. You can tell the president.
August th.
We wanted you to announce a lot earlier than that.
No, not the announcement. This.
Cardiology's good money.
Aren't you gonna say congrats?
I've never seen you be this girly.
It's a fucking diamond. I'm allowed to be a little girly.
Congratulations. I'm happy for you both.
Are you?
Sorry. That wasn't fair.
Maybe we should talk about dates for announcing the campaign.
Yeah, I have a few ideas. Let me pull up my calendar.
Week after next seems to be the best option.
You have plans tonight?
For the fireworks?
Alan and I are taking his kids.
Right. Makes sense.
You were saying, about a week after next?
  The Ambassador's inside.   You want me to go in there?
She's just putting on makeup.
I can wait until she comes out.
She's going straight to her plane. If you don't mind.
Alexi.
The day got away from me, so I have to head down to DC
for the July Fourth celebration.
You may consider me an Ambassador from the men's room.
Don't make me laugh. I'll have to start over.
  Good?   Quite.
Alexi, I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
We need to find a better way to work together.
You're letting go of the resolution?
  Eyes?   Perfect.
It's always nice to have a man's opinion.
You were right, by the way.
Israel won't back us unless we commit troops.
You called my bluff, Alexi,
and I shouldn't have insulted you with one in the first place.
I'll be outside when you finish.
The President signed an Executive Order this morning.
Five thousand US military reassigned
to permanent standby for UN Peacekeeping operations.
Jerusalem has been informed.
Your husband doesn't have that kind of authority.
It's occupied territory. He's not deploying on sovereign land.
So, as Commander in Chief,
he doesn't need Congressional approval.
Israel's back on board again, Alexi,
so the moment you sell arms to Iran,
we will shoot the planes out of the sky, the trucks off the road,
and the ships out of the water.
Now... maybe you'd be able to afford sanctions...
but you sure as hell can't afford a war.
Come back to the table. Engage us in good faith.
Or the resolution goes to a vote next week.
I have always been willing to talk.
Not you and I. President to president.
Oh, and we need Michael Corrigan released, also.
I'll communicate your message to Moscow.
Please. Hand me a towel, would you?
What a gentleman.
You ever been to the White House before?
When I won the National Book Award.
  Nancy was a fan.   I'm surprised.
That story doesn't exactly revere family values.
She's got the astrologer in her.
I think she liked the title more than anything.
Scorpio was a very good book.
  Still pays the rent.   Have a seat.
Why am I here, Mr. President?
Remy briefed you.
He said you needed a book. He didn't say about what.
America Works.
Not just the policy, but the origins.
How a boy grew up in a dirt-poor shithole
and climbed his way out through hard work.
A story of dignity. The pride that comes with one's labor.
  Propaganda.   You could call it that.
This sort of thing... it's not in my wheelhouse.
You need a salesman, not a novelist.
"Whoever you are, whoever you think you are,
believe that you're also a silent princess.
Your name is Ida.
Your journey is one through a forgotten landscape
of twisting staircases and morphing castles,
atop floating stones defiantly crossing an angry sea,
within dimly-lit caverns cobwebbed with ruins
M.C. Escher could only grasp at in a dream state."
You read my video game reviews?
I tend to play shoot 'em-ups.
The indie games don't really interest me.
I need adrenaline and action.
But when I read this, I had to try it.
If you can convince me to
be a silent princess with just a hundred words,
imagine how many millions you can convince with this book.
You are a salesman, Thomas.
I wasn't trying to sell anything. Just describe my experience.
That's exactly what I want you to do with my story.
No sales pitch, just your honest curiosity.
Besides, these kinds of books are always so boring, so safe.
I want something different, something... unique.
Your voice.
I don't even know if I believe in your program.
Come with me. I want to show you something.
You build it and they come.,
Today, the Washington Mall is the real Field of Dreams.
Three thousand people have registered
since we set up shop this morning.
Now that's what I call a Fourth of July party!
And we're gonna keep the party going 'round the clock,  ,
till everyone in DC who wants a job
can make their way down here and sign up.
Have a look.
  Do you see that line of people?   The AmWorks tent.
It stretches from there all the way to the Lincoln Memorial.
They started lining up before sunrise.
It's really something.
Thomas, at best, I'm going to be a footnote in history
if I can't help those people. At worst, I'll be a joke.
I am those people.
I want you to tell that story.
What do you say?
  I don't know.   What's your gut say?
That you don't add up, and I'm intrigued.
  But not sold.   Not yet.
Well, I'll pay you well, and at the very least,
this sort of access is worth its weight in gold, isn't it?
Sir, the First Lady's back.
I have to go give my Fourth of July speech before the fireworks.
  How quickly would you need the book?   By January.
I've never written anything in less than a year.
Well, you don't strike me
as someone who shies away from a challenge.
I'd need to be able to write it the way I want to write it.
Absolutely. Look, take your time. Enjoy the view.
Meechum will show you out when you're done.
And I promise, if you say yes, you won't regret it.
No writer worth his salt can resist a good story,
just as no politician can resist making promises he can't keep.
Viktor, we'd be honored to accept the invitation.
Yes, I agree, there's much to discuss.
I'll have my office reach out to the Kremlin.
We'll find dates that work for both of us.
Thank you.
Well, you should get some sleep. It's late over there.
Good night.
Hold off on the vote?
Until we sit down. But we keep it in our back pocket.
Michael Corrigan?
They're going to release him when we visit.
You made a miracle happen.
We did.
...each unique citizen contributes to our future.
Can you turn that up?
Our forefathers, when they declared independence,
understood the power of the individual,
the value of self-determination.
They freed us from tyranny.
  They proved...   He is a tyrant.
I don't know, there's a lot of people out there.
He might be onto something.
Executive Order for UN troops? He's out of control.
At least he's doing something. Walker didn't do shit.
I think we replaced a dud with an atom bomb.
They had to fight to secure their freedom.
And now we have to fight to maintain it.
The freedom to work.
The freedom to live with dignity.
The freedom to hope.
Thank you, and God bless the United States of America.House.of.Cards.SE
More water, ma'am?
Yes, please.
How much longer, Ben?
Estimated four hours and  minutes.
Some breakfast, maybe? The usual?
That would be wonderful. Thank you.
Only about an hour until sunrise.
Last chance for those Northern Lights.
I could tell you about
working at a movie theater, some paper route.
Riding my bicycle five miles
to deliver seven papers for ten dollars a month, but...
the truth is, I didn't have a bicycle,
and I spent more time sneaking into the movie theater
than tearing tickets.
So what was it, then?
My first job? Oh, that can't go in the book.
Why not?
I worked for a man who grew cannabis in the back woods.
A weed dealer?
No, a farmer. Uncle Henry.
He wasn't my uncle, but that's just what everybody called him.
What did you do for Uncle Henry?
I packaged the product.
For some reason, he trusted me with the scales.
And did you... partake of the product?
No. Good old Uncle Henry,
he fertilized his crop from his own septic tank.
But it was a good job, though. I saved up a lot of money.
It's how I bought all my books
my entire four years at The Sentinel.
Tell me about The Sentinel.
What was your first job?
No, no. Book's not about me.
The hustler in Scorpio.
That was you, wasn't it?
What makes you think that?
Don't writers write what they know?
The hustler's based on a friend of mine.
I didn't turn tricks.
I just... waited in the hotel lobbies
in case he got into trouble.
Tough life for a teenager.
Better than digging around in dumpsters.
What happened to him? Your friend?
He died.
Was it AIDS, like in the book?
Suicide.
Why didn't you write it that way?
Because it was fiction.
Because... suicide is too selfish.
Let's talk later.
I have a few things I gotta run over with Claire.
Sure.
It's a tight schedule,
so we may not be able to speak until the flight back.
No worries. First time in Moscow.
I've got a date with Gorky Park and Swan Lake.
How's it going?
Cathy emailed me the statement.
We got the Kremlin to tone down the language.
Do you think Corrigan will say it?
I'm sure he'll hate every word, but if it means coming home...
The only reason that Petrov is considering this is
because we have leverage in the UN.
You're both confident that this is rock solid?
If Petrov doesn't cooperate, the Secretary-General
will call an emergency session the moment we land in the States.
Let's hope we don't have to play that card.
Just don't give too much away.
Oh, listen, he's been marginalized in the Security Council,
he's detaining an American citizen,
he wants to wash his hands of.
I think we'll find that we're dealing with a much more reasonable man
than the one that visited Washington.
We fly back with a peacekeeping deal and Corrigan.
Lemons to lemonade.
I think we should give Corrigan our suite on the way back,
give him some privacy from the press.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
  Have you slept at all?   No.
  Eaten anything?   Not yet.
Here.
Come see this.
Isn't it the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?
Earth to Max.
You seem distracted.
Yeah, maybe a little.
Is it Kara?
Kara? What?
You should ask her out. I know she'd say yes.
It'd be good for you. Meet new people.
I can't. I don't trust myself yet.
What do you mean?
Hey, Max.
Tell me.
You promise you won't judge?
I won't, I promise.
Well, after she left,
there were a lot of nights of drugs and women.
And some of the women, I don't even remember.
And Kara's a nice girl, so...
But you're not that person anymore.
There were some dangerous situations.
It was all really fucked up
and I wasn't always safe.
Well, have you gotten tested?
No.
Well, then you need to be tested.
I know, but it scares the shit out of me.
Well, sure. Do you want me to go with you?
No, I don't.
There's a free clinic in Towson.
Plenty of my friends go there.
  You just walk in...   I get it! I get it.
I could go with you tomorrow if you want me to.
I don't need a mother.
Hey, I'm not trying to mother you.
I just   I care about you and I want you to be safe.
Just  
Max.
Max!
Thank you for releasing Mr. Corrigan.
It means a great deal to us.
And I'm sure a great deal to his loved ones.
We all want the same things. This is just a first step.
Mr. Litsky, my Chief of Staff, will escort you to the facilities.
  Shall we?   Mr. President.
  Thank you.   After you.
So... we start over.
As though we meet for the first time.
Please.
  Promise him a prison.   A prison?
A brand new federal corrections facility.
Why would his constituents want convicts in their backyard?
They don't.
They do want jobs in their backyard.
He's been trying to get federal funding for years.
Birch has fought him on it.
Tell him you'll get Birch to come around.
If that doesn't work,
hint there might be a place for him as Transportation Secretary.
He's owned by the auto industry.
His stance on carbon emissions is deplorable.
Then balance him out with whoever you have running the EPA.
I am not ready to make cabinet commitments this early on.
It's not a commitment. You're just open to considering him.
Doug? We should get started.
Use the auto industry to your advantage.
Whoever Winkowski supports,
every superdelegate backed by Ford and Chrysler follows.
And if that doesn't work,
tell him you're considering Dick Butler for Transportation.
He hates Butler.
I gotta go. Let me know what he says.
You're here to work on your body, not work on your work.
When the boss calls...
Well, while you're on my turf, I'm the boss.
Let's get in there and lie down on the mat.
Yes, ma'am.
  Michael.   Mrs. Underwood.
Claire.
You've been treated well?
Very well, as you can see.
Thank you, Mr. Litsky,
but I'd like to hear it from Mr. Corrigan.
Yes, they've treated me well.
  You've seen a doctor?   I have. Yesterday.
  You look thin.   I've always been thin.
The president asked me to see you in person
to share the good news.
The terms of your release have been finalized.
We'll be bringing you home with us tomorrow.
I thought you'd be pleased.
What are the terms?
There will be a joint press conference.
  With Petrov?   Yes, both presidents.
The agreement asks that you make a brief statement.
I'm sorry, um, the type is too small and I don't have glasses.
  We offered glasses to Mr. Corrigan     They did.
Mine broke during the arrest.
The other inmates don't get glasses.
I didn't want special treatment.
We provide glasses to anyone who needs them, Russian or American.
That is a lie.
I will read it.
It says, "I, Michael Corrigan,
apologize to the citizens of the Russian Federation
for breaking your laws.
I regret my part in exposing minors
to nontraditional sexual attitudes.
I am grateful to President Petrov
for the clemency my release demonstrates,
and for allowing me to return to the United States."
Who wrote it?
It's the result of extended negotiations
between representatives of the State Department
and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
I'm sorry, I can't say it.
I know it's far from ideal, Michael.
There is no ideal. Other than repealing the law.
May we have a moment?
President Petrov asked me to remain with you.
And I'm asking you to give us a moment.
Mr. Litsky? I'm assuming this cell is bugged?
I know nothing about the facilities.
  Where is it?   Mrs. Underwood.
If Mr. Corrigan and I are to speak privately,
I would like to be assured that it is truly private.
Show me where the bug is.
Thank you.
They're not going to repeal the law.
The statement is a prerequisite for your release.
There are no negotiations here, Michael.
That part already happened.
What about the  others?
They're not American.
Well, if they're not gonna be released, neither should I.
There's nothing we can do for them.
You're the First Lady, and the ambassador to the United Nations.
And you're telling me there's nothing you can do?
I refuse to believe that.
Michael, it was hard enough to negotiate just for your release.
You'll have to drag me out of here
because I'm not giving that statement.
It's just words.
Words you can disown the moment you're back on US soil.
Petrov's gay propaganda law?
That's just words, too.
So, command and control rotation.
Semi-annually, after the first year.
We pushed for immediate rotation,
  but the Israelis have     No, of course.
We need to earn their trust.
But we would never make any major decisions
without consulting your generals first.
As long as there is transparency and communication.
Well, that's the key to this entire enterprise.
Then after the first year is fine and, uh...
troop numbers look agreeable,
are you sure you can procure this many on your end?
Yes. I don't need Congress for that.
No, but the funding.
It comes out of the DOD budget like any regular deployment.
Now, infrastructure and logistical supplies for your troops,
well, we can add that expense as ancillary support.
We can pitch in.
Well, whatever you could spare would certainly be welcome.
But... that brings us to the elephant in the room.
Missile defense.
Now, I can accept a partial scale-back in Poland.
And it doesn't have to be... announced.
But we need to consider the Czech Republic.
Tell me your concerns.
Your wife values privacy.
Excuse me?
We were talking missile defense.
Why did you bring up Claire?
She's... talking privately to Corrigan. It's no matter.
Is there something wrong?
I hope not.
Now, missile defense.
A statement for the Russian media. That's all it is.
Let me ask you something.
Would you read that statement if you were me?
Yes, I would.
You'd thank a man who says you're dangerous to children?
You don't have to mean it. You just have to say it.
I went on a hunger strike for six days.
Then I stopped.
Too hungry. I couldn't go on.
One of the others that, uh, I was arrested with, Sergei,
hung in there for  days.
They decided to force-feed him,
and they finally agreed to let his mother visit.
Turns out it was too late, on both counts.
Lots of news stories about me.
None about Sergei.
A man dies and it's like nothing happened.
Because he's Russian.
I can't abandon the others in here.
Or the millions of people out there
who are told the way they are born is wrong.
But back home, you can share Sergei's story.
That doesn't do anything for him or the others.
We will drag you out if necessary.
You don't have any power over that.
But the one thing I do have power over
is not making that statement.
Okay.
What if I can get them to change the line
about nontraditional sexual attitudes?
That's what bothers you most, right?
You can't parse this. It's all or nothing.
That's not how politics works.
But it's how revolution works!
How are things going?
May I speak with you for a moment?
  What are you up to?   What do you mean?
Corrigan.
Tell me what's wrong.
You wanted him to refuse. To embarrass me.
Your wife told him not to make the statement.
That is ludicrous.
You came here with false intentions.
No. Viktor, we knew that he might be stubborn.
But this is a man with strong beliefs.
This statement is important to me.
Well, if anything, Claire is trying to convince him to make it.
Then why did she ask for the surveillance audio to be removed?
I don't know.
Perhaps so he wouldn't feel on the spot.
But, look, I wouldn't worry about this just yet.
Claire is very persuasive.
Let me be very clear.
If there is no statement, there is no deal on any front.
Not between us. Not for him.
He gets tried, convicted, sentenced.
Now, I asked Mr. Litsky to inform them both.
I have complete confidence in my wife.
And Viktor, you must know, this isn't part of any plan.
That's it.
There's no flexibility with regard to the statement.
You don't cooperate, you go to trial.
Good. They can't keep me from speaking in court.
What about your husband?
You've spoken to John?
I let him know we were hopeful.
How is he?
He's worried about you.
He wanted to come with us,
but that wasn't possible, for obvious reasons.
I promised to call after I saw you.
I was thinking... you'd call instead. From Air Force One.
He'll understand.
He misses you, Michael.
I miss him. I miss a lot of things.
My parents. My friends. My dog.
More than two square feet of sunlight.
But it's the life we chose.
It's what our bond is built on.
John has been very vocal back home.
All he talks about is your release.
You're causing him pain. And you don't have to.
And he didn't have to marry me.
  That's selfish.   Maybe.
But so is contradicting everything I believe in
just to get out of this cell.
I think what you're doing is more selfish.
It's about ego.
Proving something to yourself.
And a man back home is hurting because of it.
John is weak. He'd say the statement in a heartbeat
if he spent more than a few days in here,
which is why I'm here and he's not.
If he thinks I'm being selfish, so what?
Either he accepts it or he doesn't.
Isn't that what marriage is about?
Accepting your partner's selfishness?
You of all people should understand.
You know nothing about marriage.
You think it's about... sacrifice?
I think it's about respect.
And you're not respecting his pain.
His pain doesn't matter.
How can you say that?
Because mine doesn't either.
You know what I've been asking myself
ever since the hunger strike?
Am I truly willing to die for this?
I don't know the answer to that question.
But at least I have something that I care enough about
to even ask the question.
Have you asked that of yourself?
What are you willing to die for?
Are you ready yet, Mrs. Underwood?
Not yet.
How much longer, if I might?
Please inform the President
I won't be leaving until Mr. Corrigan comes with me.
You can't stay here, Mrs. Underwood  
Pass along the message, would you?
We can't have the First Lady staying  
You're not going to forcibly remove me.
So, please, do as I ask.
What are you doing? Viktor is beside himself.
You need to convince him to let go of the statement.
Look, you have to assume we're being overheard.
This is not a secure line.
Anything I'm saying, I'd say to Petrov himself if he were here.
I thought you were convincing Corrigan to make the statement.
Francis, I'm doing my best,
but we need to come at this from both sides.
Well, he's adamant.
He's not gonna back down and I don't blame him.
Corrigan's adamant, too.
The entire deal hinges on this.
Now, Viktor made it very clear what his needs are,
and we made promises before we  
I'm trying to salvage the situation.
There isn't much time.
We're scheduled to get back on the plane tomorrow
and the press expects Michael to get on with us.
Viktor, if you're listening to this,
please know I'm advocating on your behalf.
But you might want to consider letting the statement go.
He's not gonna do it, Claire.
Just talk to him, Francis.
If he won't let it go,
see if he'll tone it down some more.
He doesn't want all of this to fall apart either.
All right. I'll see what I can do.
I'll keep you posted.
Oh, this is great. Thank you.
If I could have a receipt...
  Oh. Excuse me. Sorry.   I appreciate it.
Hey, Max.
I'm here at the clinic.
Are you okay? You sound  
I'm scared. They're about to take the blood sample.
Can you come?
Please, I'm really scared, Lisa.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?
Yeah. Just hold tight.
Hey, um, I need to go. Do you mind taking care of all this?
Okay, thank you.
Good news, Mr. Orsay. You're negative on all fronts.
There are the results, for your records.
I've got some literature if you like, on protection,
preventative strategies, how to avoid high-risk encounters.
No, thank you, I'm... I'm good.
Yeah, actually, I will take those.
I'm positive.
I just I can't   I can't be alone right now.
Come with me. Come with me. Okay?
  Stamper.   You're good.
He said yes?
Took a couple of hours, but he's on board.
Did you have to bring up Butler?
  The prison was enough.   Great.
Who's your next target?
Willis Morrison, Twelfth District.
Ohio. I have his file at home.
I'll call you in an hour.
Surprise, surprise. You're on the phone again.
I'm on my time now, not yours.
You outta here?
Yeah, you were my last appointment.
Did that work today help?
It did. I feel great.
Well, you're making great progress.
And when you're fully recovered, you know,
we'll have that cell phone surgically removed from your ear.
See you later.
But isn't it even more powerful coming from me?
It would ring hollow. The words must come from him.
But no one will believe he means them, anyway.
Whether he means them doesn't matter.
The fact that he says them shows respect for our laws.
I wish he'd make the damn statement too,
and maybe he will. But if he doesn't,
you're willing to let all the work
we've accomplished today go down the drain
because of one loud-mouth protester
over a law you can't possibly believe in?
No, you're right. I don't believe in it.
Two of my cabinet ministers are gay.
My ex-wife's nephew is gay,
the one who is basically like a son to me.
Personally, I don't care.
So if you don't care,
let's haul him out and put him on the plane.
Look, I don't want our deal to fall apart any more than you do.
Your wife was right on the phone.
But there is more than just our deal for me to consider.
I need to show strength.
No one's going to see this as a weakness.
On the contrary, you'll be applauded for letting him go.
By who? Hm? The West?
You don't understand Russia, Mr. President.
If people don't like the job you're doing,
they vote you out of office.
If they don't like the job I'm doing, they topple statues.
Blood is spilled. Chaos takes over.
Is the gay propaganda law barbaric? Yes.
Of course it is.
But religion, tradition,
for most of my people, it's in their bones.
This law was passed for them.
I have to represent my people the same way you do.
And if there is no cost to Corrigan's actions,
many of my people will feel betrayed.
There won't be a revolution because you freed one man.
Revolution sneaks up on you, one small step at a time.
I don't take chances, even with the smallest of steps.
No stone left unturned when the First Lady's in town.
Can I ask you something?
If you pass the salt.
How did Michael Corrigan become Michael Corrigan?
  Gay?   An activist.
I'm sure you got a briefing from the FBI.
Yes, but I would like to hear it from you.
A friend of mine, and this is in the early 's,
she invited me to go with her to a community organizing meeting.
I had nothing better to do, so I said okay.
We get there and there's maybe  people in the room, tops.
It was pretty sad, actually.
And the guy speaking is talking about garbage.
  Garbage?   Recycling.
And the guy is putting all  of us to sleep.
What he was saying made sense, but... zero charisma.
anti-charisma.
But I noticed he had this habit of, uh...
tilting his head when he was making an important point.
It was... it was so endearing.
It was like this.
Like...
I couldn't help it. I fell in love with him right then and there.
This was John?
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.
Well, he's pretty charismatic on TV.
He learned charisma. I learned how to think.
We rubbed off on each other well.
I didn't know you'd been together so long.
Twenty-one years.
Only been married for five because, well, we couldn't earlier.
Francis and I just celebrated .
Over half your life.
That's true. I haven't even thought about that.
You were young.
Twenty-two.
You ever regret it?
No. No. I love Francis.
Now more than ever.
I regret it.
Committing to someone before I even knew who I was.
We didn't take legal vows,
but we had our own version.
  Stupid.   Why?
Because all I've ever done is hurt him.
Um, kept him in my shadow, cheated on him, you name it.
Well, it's the history that counts,
not the other things, right?
That's true. No substitute for history.
But it's unfair to him.
I don't believe in fairness.
I don't think you do either, even though you fight for it.
And I don't believe you love your husband more than ever.
How could you possibly know?
Takes one to know one.
John and I haven't slept with each other in almost two years.
We don't even sleep in the same bedroom.
We've talked about separating, but we never follow through.
It seems wrong to fight this hard for marriage equality
and then get divorced.
Bad for business.
Honestly, I don't think it's how humans are built.
To be with each other for  years.
You don't have that option either, do you?
How do you mean?
Well, if you wanted something else,
that would be really bad for business.
You should eat.
Said the snake to Eve.
Eat your apple. The world won't end.
You need to get on the phone and tell her to leave.
She wouldn't listen to me even if I did.
She's dead set on convincing this guy for your benefit.
I'll have the guards escort her out if necessary.
They will not lay a finger on my wife.
You'd actually prefer that, wouldn't you?
So you could tell the world
we dragged the First Lady out by her hair.
I'm finding it more and more difficult to tolerate your paranoia.
I could say the same of your lies.
When I lie to you, you'll never know it,
and it will be for a good reason.
Corrigan doesn't fall into that category.
I should never have invited you here.
You and I can work together. This afternoon is proof.
I would've been better off holding my ground.
And forcing us to pass the resolution?
The United Nations? They mean nothing to me.
If they meant nothing to you, you would have held your ground.
But you want to be respected abroad as much as you are at home.
And I came here out of respect, Viktor.
And I sympathize with the situation you're in.
That we're both in.
Let's not let Michael Corrigan
dictate the course of nations.
Can we at least discuss
what a statement from me might look like?
You look exhausted.
I didn't sleep much on the plane, so...
You should go back.
There's no reason for you to be in here with me.
I'm not leaving.
You're more stubborn than I am.
Why won't you let me help you?
I've made my demands clear.
Michael, let me tell you what's going to happen
if you refuse to make this statement.
You'll help no one.
In fact, life will get worse
for the others you were arrested with.
Petrov will feel embarrassed. He will arrest more people.
He will pass worse laws.
He's not going to let some American homosexual dictate his policy.
This man is ruthless.
You think he's gonna become reasonable suddenly
when all of this falls apart?
You're being naive!
And you're letting other people suffer because of it.
Don't undo what you've fought so hard for.
You think you can shame me. But you can't.
I'm giving you the truth.
I don't care how that makes you feel.
But do yourself the favor of hearing what I said.
  I heard you.   I hope so.
I can't betray myself. What would I be then?
You'd be a politician. And that's what you are.
Let the others do all the yelling and screaming.
You want change? Then learn how to compromise.
Be a fucking adult about this, Michael.
I need to think. Okay? I need time.
The plane leaves tomorrow.
You should go back. I need time to think alone.
  Clear my head.   I'm not leaving here without you.
I need time!
Just... lie down for a little bit.
Just get some rest.
  I just can't talk anymore.   Okay.
Okay, I will.
For a few minutes.
Thanks.
There's treatment now.
The thing that angers me the most
is that I let her do this to me.
Did you feel that way about your ex?
The pain that just consumes you?
For a while, yeah.
Still, on bad days.
What was she like?
Sorry, you don't have to...
No, I don't mind.
She was...
She'd had a tough life.
She had a lot of baggage. Which I did, too.
We started out as friends and then we moved in together.
And then it just happened.
We fell in love.
And I don't know, I guess...
I felt stronger with her.
And I think she felt the same way.
And I guess maybe it was naive,
but I thought that together, we could let go of all that baggage.
Then we'd just be us.
Well, why did she leave?
She said everything was happening too quickly.
Have you spoken to her... since?
Nope. She stopped coming to the fellowship.
I stopped by her apartment once,
her landlord said she was gone.
Just no idea where she is?
We used to lie in bed and fantasize about where we'd go
if we could go anywhere. Paris, Australia, Timbuktu.
That was Rachel, the far-off places. I didn't need that.
Where would you go?
The Jimenez Trail.
Where is that?
New Mexico.
Cuts across the whole state.
It's got hot springs and waterfalls.
We used to say we'd go there, hike it,
find a good spot, build a cabin.
I'm sorry, we shouldn't be talking about me.
I asked.
That tea smells good.
I think I'll have some, too.
This looks good.
  You say every word.   Of course.
And then you take him directly to the plane.
Viktor... thank you.
But the Czech Republic,
I want all the missiles gone, not just a scale-back.
You can keep something in Poland for show, but that's it.
Agreed.
So, we have a deal?
Including everything we discussed about the Jordan Valley.
Yes, of course.
Then we have a deal.
Come, Mrs. Underwood.
Please. You shouldn't be here.
Mrs. Underwood.
I'm sorry.
Would you like to lie down for a bit? Change your clothes?
No, I can do that on the plane.
Well, you go straight there.
We have the press conference to do.
I should be with you, Francis.
We have that handled.
I'd like to say something. A few warm words to his family.
Yes. Yes, of course.
I'll echo your sympathy and then...
then say that I was planning on releasing him today.
I'll thank you for your... your generosity.
How tragic this has been.
And then a few words about the Jordan Valley,
or if you'd prefer to announce our agreement.
No, no, it's fine if you do.
Would you... mind if your people
showed me a draft of your remarks?
Yes, I'll have them draft something right now.
And yours, too, Mrs. Underwood?
Yes. It's fine. Whatever you want.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Good morning.
Mrs. Underwood would like to start by saying a few words.
As you all know, Michael Corrigan was found dead
in his cell this morning.
He had hung himself.
Michael and I spoke briefly yesterday.
He was being treated well and was grateful to President Petrov
for granting his imminent release.
We don't know why... Michael chose to do what he did.
We all wanted nothing more than for Michael to come home today
and we offer our heartfelt condolences
to his family and his loved ones.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.
Mrs. Underwood?
I didn't just speak to him yesterday,
I was there when it happened, asleep.
He hung himself with my scarf.

because he didn't want to lie.
And I can't dishonor him by telling a lie now.
Claire...
I was trying to convince him to say that he broke the law,
to thank President Petrov.
But he refused, because he didn't want to leave
until the law was repealed.
Until the Russians who were arrested for the same crime
were also released.
Michael was willing to die for what he believed in.
  Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.   He was brave.
  And his voice deserves to be heard.   That's enough.
If it weren't for this unjust law,
and ignorance and intolerance of your government,
Michael would still be with us.
Shame on you, Mr. President.
My wife has been under a...
great amount of stress these past  hours.
She's clearly in shock.
My apologies to President Petrov and to the Russian people.
If you'll excuse me, I need to be with her now.
  Claire.   Don't, Francis.
It's imperative that I speak to him.
Well, keep trying, Cathy.
If Petrov won't get on the phone with me,
then I'll speak to Bugayev.
Whoever will get on the phone with me, then.
All right. Thank you.
Your coffee, sir.
Thank you, Ben.
  Mr. President.   Later.
I just got off the phone with Cathy. The deal's off.
Everything we negotiated.
We have to discuss the next move.
I know what I did. It seemed impulsive,
  but it wasn't     It happened. Let's move on.
If you have something you would like to say, Francis...
I just want to minimize the damage.
If Petrov won't come around,
we have to move forward with the resolution at the UN.
We're prepared for that.
Good. Thank you. Try to get some sleep.
Shouldn't you be in the back, with the press?
  I'm not press.   You're not staff either.
My apologies.
Mrs. Underwood?
You did the right thing.
I know you're angry.
You should be.
But I had to do it.
Is this some sort of apology,
or you need to get something off your chest?
I want you to try and understand.
Understand?
  What you did was beyond     I know.
You're not only the First Lady, and an ambassador,
you're also my wife.
  In what order?   Oh, come on, Claire.
I said what I said for him.
Not for myself, not for us.
I felt we owed him more than a few false words.
So you want me to forgive you? To say that it was okay?
  No.   Because I can't do that.
I'm not asking you to.
Then why are we even discussing it?!
Because I want you to know why.
I don't care why.
I don't care what your reasons are.
There is no reason that can possibly convince me
that you should have sabotaged a peace plan we spent months on!
It was a political mistake.
Yes, I admit that. But if I had said nothing,
his death would have meant nothing.
No. Not death. Don't give him that.
  Suicide.   No.
Something undeniable. I was not gonna try and deny it.
  I don't even understand that.   If you'd give me a chance.
I gave you a chance with the recess appointment,
with the resolution, with handling Corrigan.
He didn't have a choice, Francis. We cornered him.
  He did have a choice.   Not in his mind.
No one forced him to protest in Moscow.
And we sure as hell didn't ask him
to tie your scarf around his neck!
If you had spoken to him...
and heard what he had to say  
Oh, what, I would have had some moral epiphany?
  Yes, you would have.   I don't think so.
Because I'm the President of the United States
and I can separate the big from the small.
He wasn't small.
He was a coward and I'm glad he's dead.
He had more courage than you'll ever have.
Do you really want to discuss courage, Claire?
Because anyone can commit suicide,
or spout their mouth in front of a camera.
But you wanna know what takes real courage?
Keeping your mouth shut, no matter what you might be feeling.
Holding it all together when the stakes are this high.
We're murderers, Francis.
No, we're not. We're survivors.
If we can't show some respect for one brave man
and still accomplish what we set out to do,
then I'm disappointed in both of us.
I should've never made you ambassador.
I should've never made you president.
What are you looking at?House.of.Cards.SE
Do you renew your commitment
to this woman as your lawful wedded wife,
to love her, honor her, comfort her,
keep her in sickness and in health,
forsaking all others, be true to her,
as long as you both shall live?
I do.
Do you renew your commitment to this man
as your lawful wedded husband,
to love him, honor him, comfort him,
keep him in sickness and in health,
forsaking all others, be true to him,
as long as you both shall live?
I do.
May this renewed commitment deepen your love for each other
and strengthen your eternal bond.
Francis?
No photographs when they unload his body.
Will you promise me that?
A lot of people are calling you a hero.
A lot of people aren't.
Francis, I will get this peacekeeping resolution
passed through the General Assembly.
I owe you that.
So we have the photograph tomorrow for the presidential portrait.
It's what they're gonna base the painting on.
I'll be smiling. Will you?
What are they doing?
Part of a... cultural exchange, sir, with Tibet.
They'll be here for a month.
A month?
Don't worry, your handwriting's atrocious.
Couldn't read a thing.
  Tom.   I know. Kate Baldwin.
I know.
Gold stars for us.
It only took two months
riding on the same plane to introduce ourselves.
Maybe I'm shy.
Oh, no, you're not. You just don't mingle with the peasants.
If one of us is a peasant, I think it's me.
I'm sorry I can't stay here in Gaffney with you.
It's okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Maybe tonight, if all goes well.
Feeling optimistic?
I made you a promise.
Well, go on. You have a plane waiting.
Thank you.
Tom.
The Republicans are introducing a bill
that amends the Stafford Act.
They say that the siphoning of FEMA funds
for America Works violates the appropriation.
So let them.
It's got bipartisan support.
Dunbar's going to publicly support the bill.
  What about Jackie?   She's trying to stay out of it,
but if it goes to a vote, she's gotta go with the tide.
We don't want her poll numbers
to take a hit as she's starting to gain on Dunbar.
If they pass the bill, I'll veto it.
If they override, I'll refuse to enforce.
By the time it gets to the Supreme Court,
we'll have jobs to show,
they'll have nothing but rhetoric.
This is a public relations battle, not a legal one.
Statement?
Just what I just said, less combative.
So, how do we want to do this?
I think the First Lady should sit. You behind her.
Does that work for you, Mrs. Underwood?
Uh, yes, whatever works best.
Let me adjust the light for her, and then I'll place you, sir.
The African bloc just added
a provision to the peacekeeping resolution.
What does it say?
Requires African command of the forces.
It's a poison pill, Francis.
There's no way Israel or Palestine will get on board with that.
You think the Russians are behind it?
Probably. Cathy and I are investigating.
All right, Mr. President. Just behind your wife, please.
Do you prefer I not?
What?
Where you had your hand is perfect.
Great. All right. Here we go.
A little more of a smile, please.
Come in.
Any luck today?
Moryakov... says it wasn't them.
Not that I trust him.
So now I just need to see if I can get Zimbabwe to talk.
Today, when we took the photo...
I touched your shoulder.
Yes?
You flinched.
  What?   I felt it.
No, I didn't.
It was like...
you recoiled.
I think you're reading too much into something
that I don't think actually happened.
All right. Forget I said anything.
Wait.
I just...
Never mind. I don't know what I was gonna say.
Good night.
House must've been somewhere out there.
Well, if you can call it a house.
It was no bigger than that truck.
Nothing left of the farm, which is for the best.
Peaches didn't want to grow here anyway.
That's what you get for planting on land
with solid rock two feet below the topsoil.
You know, that's one of the points
that we should make in the book,
that hard work is only worth it in the right conditions.
We want to set people up for success.
Vocational training, legitimate career paths.
Welcome back. How was Gaffney?
Do we have a time set for Ambassador Caspi yet?
Her office is stalling.
Get her schedule. We'll go wherever she is.
I think she'll be at the cocktail reception tonight
  at the Mexican Consulate.   I'll call and find out.
What's that?
It came in for you this morning.
Francis?
John Pasternak. Michael Corrigan's husband.
The latest pile of interview requests is on your desk,
most of them Corrigan related.
And GLAAD wants you to be a keynote speaker
at their Media Awards Ceremony.
How did he know?
About your vows? It's been in the news.
No, that I liked tulips.
Did your mother work?
As a maid, mostly.
In high demand, because she was white.
People assumed she wouldn't steal any valuables,
but of course she did.
I remember one night, she came home with two sapphire earrings.
She took them to the pawn shop in Spartanburg the next day,
but she wore them all night long, even slept in them.
I guess she wanted to know
what it felt like to have real jewelry,
even if it was just for a few hours.
That does not go in the book.
Why didn't your parents have any more kids?
That's not relevant to what we're doing.
I'm just trying to get a sense of your family.
The barn must've been somewhere right over there.
My father used to escape in there to get away from us.
Usually brought a bottle with him.
Did you love your father?
He was a good man, down deep.
He cared for us greatly.
Worked hard to put food on the table.
Didn't always succeed, but that wasn't for a lack of trying.
See... that's not an answer.
I asked you if you loved your father, you don't tell me.
You tell me what you want me to write.
Which is what you've done since the beginning.
It's time to start telling the truth.
  You think I've been lying?   I know you have.
The only time you haven't is that one night in the White House.
The worst adventure I've ever been on. I can promise you...
  I don't get it.   The game is unwinnable.
  What is the point?   That is the point.
I find it unlikely that
we'll ever progress by starting over and over again.
  But it's got to be better than this.   Oh, God.
Okay, let's give it a shot. Why not?
  Something was very clear.   It just started over again.
It keeps doing that over and over.
Ignore his instructions, he sends you back.
What if I follow his instructions?
Chaos takes over. Randomness.
It's impossible to follow the rules.
Another time. It's too much like my real life.
Besides, we shouldn't be playing games.
You should be asking me questions.
You're getting me drunk.
I won't remember what I asked.
The last time I got this drunk, I broke into a library.
In Charleston, my alma mater.
The Sentinel.
I almost puked all over myself.
That's Chapter Eight: "POTUS Blows Chunks."
Can you keep it down, please?
  Come join us.   So sorry.
  I was asleep.   Oh. We'll...
  We'll move into the study.   Thank you.
Francis?
I'll be right there in a minute.
I don't like him being up here.
We'll be more quiet.
This is our private space.
  He's my guest.   He's a stranger.
All right. After tonight, no more.
I'm not being unreasonable.
I should've...
realized how much noise we were making.
Can I ask you a question?
Well, that's what you're here for, isn't it?
Why don't you sleep in the same room?
Uh, that just sorta happened over...
a few months after we moved in here.
Everything okay?
Between you two?
Oh, you bet.
Well, it's been better.
No, it's not okay.
The fight. Coming back from Moscow.
You heard us?
The yelling. Not what you said.
We don't fight often, but, uh...
This one...
scabs keep coming off.
We said things.
Things you just can't take back.
It's late. We should call it a night.
Thomas.
I have no interest in salaciousness.
August fourteenth is the anniversary of the New Deal.
I'd like to hit , by that date.
I believe we can do that, sir.
Remy, what's the timeline
on the Senate bill outlawing FEMA funds?
The Leg office predicts the Senate version
will pass in two to three weeks.
Working with friendlies in the House.
Throw some pork on it, slow it down.
That's all the more reason that we need to accelerate.
If I'm gonna veto this bill,
I want it to be because it's gonna kill , new jobs.
  Jobs that we created.   Yes, sir.
Cathy?
The Russians remain intransigent on the Jordan Valley.
The ambassador is working hard
to push the peacekeeping resolution to a vote
  by the General Assembly.   Why the delay?
We're having a hard time getting the African bloc
to remove the poison pill provision.
We think Israel's behind it. They got cold feet,
convinced the African bloc
to sabotage the resolution so they have an out.
Do I need to speak to the Prime Minister?
Uh, the Israeli ambassador has already denied.
I think we need to keep our focus on the provision itself.
All right.
The head of the African bloc is Zimbabwe.
And we believe Israel has promised
them a sizable aid package for HIV prevention.
The Secretary and I recommend
increasing our relief funds to Zimbabwe.
Outspend the Israelis.
Well, President Chimbetu will just pocket the money.
Well, we always anticipate a certain level of graft.
A certain level? He's egregious. The man's a monster.
Who happens to run the African bloc.
Who happens to kill his people when he's not stealing from them,
which is why I reduced aid to Zimbabwe.
If we want him to remove the amendment, we have to be persuasive.
We are scraping together every penny we can to save AmWorks.
The last thing I want
is to be slammed for giving additional money
to a brutal dictator from USAID
just to persuade him. This is ill-conceived.
You should think before you bring a proposal such as this.
We'll pursue other strategies and get back to you, Mr. President.
Thank you. Robert, what's the latest on the omnibus?
Sir, the legislation should go
to the floor in the next couple of months.
The leadership is pushing...
Set up calls with both Lockheed and Northrop.
We'll pay people to get trained and call it a job.
It isn't a job unless the union says it is.
Well, one step at a time.
You set up the training and I'll speak to the AFL.
Are the AARP here?
In the lobby. The chairman told me they want to support Dunbar.
They're just trying to rattle us.
Dunbar is promising to save Social Security.
Go after Wall Street and government waste instead of entitlements.
Well, get them in here.
You have your call list.
Their meeting's not for another ten minutes.
Start bringing them over.
It'll take them that long to hobble over on their walkers.
  Francis?   I'll go get them.
I only have a few minutes.
You singled me out today on purpose.
  What?   The cabinet meeting.
If I'm gonna invite you to cabinet meetings,
there's not gonna be any kid gloves.
Don't make it sound like a favor.
You wanted to be there. I agreed.
Well, so I could be informed and do my job.
Everyone in that room is judged by what they bring to the table.
What you brought to the table was amateurish.
Both Cathy and I proposed that plan.
I fault her as much as you. You're making this too personal.
It is personal.
I think you're punishing me for what happened in Russia.
Oh, come on.
Well, you said it on the plane. Appointing me was a mistake.
Yeah, you said far worse things to me.
Yes, and I've gone out of my way to put that fight behind us.
Oh, really? Like with Thomas?
When you screamed at us for waking you up.
  I didn't scream.   It was embarrassing.
Who cares what he thinks?
He was our guest and you walked in there like  
I think you're searching for things that aren't there
and ignoring the things that are,
  like this photograph flinching nonsense.   Oh, Jesus.
  Do you want me to resign, Francis?   Don't be ridiculous.
Just say it.
You never wanted me to be ambassador.
You remember what you said to me on the plane?
You should have never made me president.
I was upset. I didn't mean it.
You did mean it. You think you made me.
No, I don't. I think we're a team, actually.
Well, we're not a team at the moment.
I can't believe we've become this.
  Become what?   Like everyone else.
You ready, sir?
No, just give me a minute. Let the smoke clear.
Where are we at?
Her hair's different.
But I  
  Where was this taken?   Santa Fe.
I've narrowed the search to focus just on that city.
This is all I have, but I think it's a good start.
I should go there.
No. These photos are three weeks old.
She might have been passing through.
Or she might still be there.
Okay, but if you start asking questions, you might tip her off.
Get me more, then.
How's my passport coming?
I'll get the lock lifted when you find her.
I've shown you some progress.
I think I should be seeing progress on your side, too.
This isn't enough.
They just arrested another one of my friends.
  They could charge me at any minute.   Gavin...
The things that I've had to do to get this much are fucked up.
An exact location.
That was our deal.
Can you get me the camera feed?
The system's monitoring it.
I want it, too.
I'll send you the link.
Doug? This is Maurice.
He'll be taking over for me. I'm moving to Seattle.
My sister's opening up her own PT center
and she wants me to be a partner.
I'm moving all my clients over to new folks.
So I can help the transition.
I'll be sad to see you go.
I'll go get some bar floats.
Back in a second.
Look... I'm having people over this Thursday.
It's a going-away thing at my place. You should come.
  You ready?   Yeah.
I'll text you the details.
I want to go after the big boys.
Not just Wall Street, but Walmart.
I'd be careful with Walmart.
You'll lose a lot of friends in Congress.
Let's force them to take sides.
That means Jackie Sharp, too.
Introduce legislation.
She either votes for it or we hit her hard.
Any corporation who has more
than ten percent of its employees on food stamps
has to increase wages until they're below ten percent.
Who has the guts to sponsor something like that?
Doug?
Yeah, I'll put a list together.
You'll have something by the end of the week.
Okay. Talk to you then.
You made it.
Yeah.
  How long have you been here?   Ten minutes.
Come on. We need to get people dancing.
Actually, I was thinking that I should go.
I just came over to say goodbye.
No. You are not going anywhere.
You don't have to dance, but you can't leave.
Last man standing.
You have recycling?
Just leave 'em on the counter.
I'll take care of it tomorrow.
You really don't have to help.
I don't mind.
You're such a gentleman.
I don't know about that.
Oh, you're not a gentleman?
Because... that could be interesting.
I made you a caf au lait.
How is it?
  Need sugar?   No.
It's perfect.
When are the movers coming by?
Not for a couple hours.
You need any help? Packing the rest up?
No. You just relax.
You seemed a little sad last night.
No, just tired.
Was that it? You were just tired?
Someone I haven't heard from in a long time.
She reached out. It was  
It was a little hard.
Last night wasn't 'cause you felt sorry for me, was it?
No.
Last night was because I'm getting on a plane today,
and I'll probably never see you again.
Why not?
You know it rains a lot in Seattle, right?
Are you gonna come with me to the memorial today?
Do I need to be there?
No.
I'm buried right now.
Fine.
Why has Tom Yates been hanging around so much?
Is he writing a book on the president?
We've all asked him and he won't say.
Ballsy move if it's true.
Yeah. I can't stand his writing.
Are you an idiot?
I'm an idiot for having an opinion?
There's no opinions to be had. His writing is gorgeous.
Well, in my opinion, it isn't.
Said the guy who can't write a grocery list.
Ready whenever you are, sir.
Today marks the th Anniversary of the Social Security Act.
It has survived longer than many of its beneficiaries.
We should all be so lucky to live as long as it has.
But by the time the human body has circled the sun  times,
its youth and vigor are gone.
Joints ache, bones and muscles are weaker,
the heart doesn't beat with the same power it once did.
All of us must face this truth eventually.
And when we do, we must hand the baton to the young.
To those who have the strength
to carry on our work when we are gone.
Here's another truth: Social Security is dying.
Now in its th year, it must give way
to a new, younger, stronger plan for the future.
That plan is America Works.
In Washington DC alone, we've managed to reduce unemployment
by over a third and put , people to work.
If we can accomplish so much
in so little time here in Washington,
imagine what we could accomplish
if Congress funded America Works
nationwide.
We wouldn't be talking about thousands of jobs.
We'd be talking about millions.
Later this afternoon,
I will visit FDR's memorial to pay my respects to the man
who ushered in Social Security  years ago.
We honor the dead for giving us the world we inherited.
However, we must recognize
we are doomed if we allow the dead to govern us.
Thank you, and God bless the United States of America.
From NBC News in Washington,
this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.
Good morning and welcome to Meet the Press.
I have with me Congresswoman Huntley and Congressman Greer.
Congresswoman, let me start with you.
In the President's radio address today,
he said the model here in Washington is a model for the nation.
Do you agree?
I do, Chuck.
I was skeptical at first.
Both my parents benefited from Social Security.
And I've always counted on it for myself.
But, when I think about my kids, and my grandkids  
Rebecca raises a good point, one that we've been making
in the Republican Party for decades.
And yet, while you support America Works,
most members of your party do not.
Chuck, I've never been a big fan of Frank Underwood.
But the park near my house here in Washington has never been cleaner.
The dry cleaners I go to just hired two new people this month.
The daycare I drop my kids off at doubled their staff
so the children can get more individual attention.
The president may have overstepped in taking FEMA money,
but when something works, it works. And America Works works.
Hello.
Promise the money.
Whatever you need to turn him around.
I'll approve the USAID funds.
What made you change your mind?
Today... at the memorial.
You know what struck me the most?
Eleanor.
She was off by herself.
Alone.
And so was Franklin. He was alone.
And there was a wall between them.
The monks.
They've been here for weeks. We haven't even discussed them once.
It's beautiful, isn't it? What they're doing?
It is.
Francis, I watched them for over an hour today.
And all I was thinking was,
why aren't you and I sharing this together?
We have to do something, Claire.
I know.
What are you thinking?
My natural color. Like when I first met Francis.
  This color?   Yes. Exactly.
Okay. Have a seat.
I want to take up the sleeves a touch.
Oh, I think they're perfect. Thank you.
  What do you think?   Beautiful.
We have gathered today
to renew the vows between Francis J. Underwood
and Claire Hale Underwood.
It was here, in this church,
that you two first committed yourselves to one another.
May this renewed commitment deepen your love for each other,
and strengthen your eternal bond.
Claire's father bought us this house.
I wanted to pay for it myself. That's always bothered me.
You weren't bothered to let him pay for your first campaign?
Well, that's politics. It's different.
You take money wherever you can get it.
No, this was our first home.
  Was it a happy home?   Oh, please.
I thought you brought me here
because we were gonna cut through the bullshit.
This book is supposed to be about America Works.
There is no book without you at the center of it.
Do you trust me? Or don't you?
Because if you don't, get someone else to write it.
Or write it yourself.
You don't know what it's like
to go through life looking over your shoulder.
Having secrets no one would understand.
I didn't write my first book.
My friend.
The one who died.
He wrote it?
The first half. He didn't show it to anyone except me.
In the hospital, he asked me destroy it.
I told him I would.
It was too good.
It needed to be finished. So I finished it.
And took all the credit.
Oh, yeah. It's my part, the ending.
That's what people remember.
But the book...
My entire career...
It's all based on a lie.
You don't have a monopoly on secrets.
There's tulips buried under here.
Claire planted them.
I've always...
from day one...
been ashamed she said yes when I asked her to marry me.
Why?
I didn't think I deserved her.
I can tell you this, though,
there would have been no White House without Claire.
I was half the man before I met her.
But still, I've been selfish...
feeding off her the way I have.
She knew what she was getting into.
Probably. She knows me better than I know myself.
Sir? We're scheduled to fly out at :.
Should probably leave in the next few minutes.
Thank you, Meechum.
Scribble away.
So, what'd he tell you in front of the house?
Nothing much.
Well, it looked intense, whatever it was.
See? This is why I don't ride in the van.
You did this time.
Sometimes you just need to leave someone alone.
All right, I got the hint.
I meant him. Not me.
Where are they?
  Who?   The monks.
Oh, they finished earlier today, sir.
So it's gone?
I believe so.
I didn't get a chance to see it.
I'm sure they took a photo.
Will you ask someone to get me a copy?
Right away, sir.
Claire. I almost didn't recognize you.
Yes, I decided it was time for a change.
It's very fetching.
I hope you don't mind me crashing your party.
Oh, of course not. My staff said you'd be out of town.
Would you mind if I borrowed Ambassador Caspi for a moment?
Of course.
You've been avoiding me for three weeks.
I had a trip to Jerusalem.
You promised Zimbabwe  million
so they'd introduce the poison pill amendment.
  For purely humanitarian reasons.   No.
This is the first time you've ever sent aid to Zimbabwe.
Don't draw connections that don't exist.
We would never try to sabotage the resolution.
The United States is our ally.
That's right, we are.
So act like it.
Excuse me?
My husband formally approved
our own humanitarian package for eighty million.
Zimbabwe will be withdrawing the amendment tomorrow.
And when the resolution goes to a vote,
I expect Israel to support it like the loyal ally she is.
Not lie to us.
That's not the way to solicit our support.
I'm not soliciting. I'm demanding.
I feel sorry for you, Claire.
Your husband sends you to talk tough.
But as soon as things go wrong in the Jordan Valley,
he'll turn his back and leave Israel to clean up the mess.
He doesn't have the muscle.
He can't even get Congress to work with him.
Or back you up after you call out Petrov.
He turned his back on you just like he will on us.
My husband is the bravest and most resolute man I know.
He will succeed in this plan.
Brave?
I served in Jordan Valley.
As did the President and the Foreign Minister. Has he?
You held a gun and somebody told you where to stand.
Don't confuse that with the burden the Commander in Chief faces.
Francis has given the order to kill.
He's buried soldiers he's put into harm's way.
And every day, he wakes up bearing responsibilities
you can't possibly imagine.
They would crush you if they fell on your shoulders.
So you talk to your superiors.
And when the amendment is withdrawn tomorrow,
you will commit to supporting the resolution.House.of.Cards.SE
When surface temperatures in the Atlantic rise above  degrees,
conditions are ideal for a hurricane.
Westerly winds kick up condensation,
forming cumulonimbus clouds which begin to revolve around a central axis.
On September seventh, these exact conditions gave birth to the Hurricane Faith.
currently barreling toward the Eastern seaboard of the United States.
On November th, ,
a different sort of hurricane swirled into being.
A  year-old Harvard Law graduate
took South Carolina State Senate District Fourteen by storm.
His name was Francis J. Underwood.
How strong will it be when it hits?
Simulators say Cat Three, possibly Cat Four.
Major devastation across a dozen states.
Yes, but some of these projections have it turning back to sea.
That's highly unlikely, sir.
Sir, FEMA's mission is to prepare for the worst.
First responders, medical, mass evacuation.
I'm worried about the funding.
The Disaster Relief Fund has been depleted by a third
since you launched AmWorks.
That still leaves two billion.
Well, for this storm, we need four times that.
I'm about to meet with the leadership
to ask them to replenish the fund,
but I can't ask for that much.
We need eight billion minimum for bare-bones preparation.
We shouldn't gamble with something like this, sir.
Hundreds could die. Maybe thousands.
"The impossible made possible.
The thing no one else dares to do,
that everyone says can't be done.
Imagine a boy standing on the shores of the Charleston Harbor.
Two miles away, a faint line on the horizon, is Fort Sumter.
All the other boys say it's impossible to swim there.
But this one boy thinks it can be done.
The others gasp as he kicks off his shoes,
plunges into the water.
They watch with shock as he grows farther from the shore.
They whisper to each other solemnly,
'He'll drown. He'll never make it.'
'No, he'll turn around when it gets too hard.'"
Mr. President.
Have a seat. I'll have Jessica bring in some refreshments.
Henry Mitchell, the new Senate Majority Leader.
What happened to Hector Mendoza?
Well, you don't declare a couple of paid speeches as income
and boom, you're no longer in Congress,
and certainly not running for president.
You got rid of Ronnie. Hector loved that painting.
He's not gone, just in storage.
Just like Hector.
My father served under Eisenhower.
Drove his jeep in Normandy.
Your father was at D-Day?
Utah Beach. At Bastogne too.
Isn't this just a little love fest.
Gentlemen, the hurricane. I need the DRF replenished.
The Speaker's calling for an emergency session tonight.
We're prepared to allocate ten billion.
I was only gonna ask for eight.
You sign the bill, you'll get the ten billion.
But no FEMA money or any other agency funds can be used
for your jobs program again, under any circumstances.
Don't politicize this.
America Works and the hurricane are two separate issues.
Excuse me, Mr. President,
but you're the one that raided the DRF for political purposes.
We're correcting a wrong.
And jeopardizing the entire Eastern Seaboard.
That's on the White House, not on us.
We're supplying the funds, the money you took illegally.
If you choose not to sign the bill, we can't be blamed.
We stepped up.
I thought you might try to make this about America Works.
And look, I admit, I may have overstepped.
But let me show you something.
Every day, I ask the Comms office
to give me profiles of ten AmWorks beneficiaries.
These are success stories.
This is just a fraction
of the , people that we put back to work.
With money that wasn't appropriated for that purpose.
You don't get to break the piggy bank
then ask us to glue it together and put in more pennies.
I've got over  Democrats and Republicans in both houses
that have publicly supported
America Works since its introduction.
The tide is turning.
Your own people are getting behind the program.
Then where are they now? Why aren't we getting calls?
Why do they all support this emergency bill?
If you pass it, I'll veto it,
but there's no reason we have to turn this into a pissing match.
You know that we have the votes to override your veto.
It passes in ten days without a signature, regardless.
The only question
is whether you're gonna sign it before that hurricane hits,
or watch it become law after thousands have died.
Henry...
I sat with Hector
dozens of times at this very table
and we were always able
to work out our differences, to negotiate.
This isn't Hector's office anymore.
Or his table.
Gentlemen, is there no room for a compromise?
  No.   Bob?
No, Mr. President.
It's going wide in an hour.
Seven governors, all up and down the East Coast.
They're demanding that you sign the bill.
  Who tipped you off?   Jim Matthews' flack.
Matthews is turning on us? What's it say?
"President Underwood has undermined the separation of powers
and put the fate of the entire East Coast
in Hurricane Faith's hands.
I am joining with the Governors
of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland  "
That's enough. I don't need to hear any more.
See how many governors you can get on the phone in  minutes.
  Yes, sir.   I've got something else for you, sir.
The AmWorks case studies. These are your ten for the day.
  I don't have time for that now.   You should see this top file.
Freddy's working as a dishwasher.
He was one of the first people to sign up.
Should I prepare a statement in response to the governors?
Sir?
No statement. No. Not yet.
Yes, sir.
  Yes, sir?   Send a message to the entire cabinet.
I want a meeting tomorrow morning, first thing.
"During his tenure as whip,
Underwood was known for employing intimidation,
bravado and fear.
His recent stance against Russia
is a continuation of strong-arm diplomacy,
carried out by his wife, whom he appointed UN ambassador
despite the Senate voting her down.
The use of FEMA funds for America Works
shocked many,
but it's simply the most recent
in a career's worth of unilateral moves.
Minority Leader Bob Birch said,
'The President consistently demonstrates an utter
lack of partnership coupled with reckless abandon.'"
Sir, have you given any thought
to simply signing the bill that Congress passed last night?
How many of you think I should sign the bill?
Well, surely, some of you think I should.
You know, I think too often,
the people in this room are afraid of upsetting me.
And that's my fault.
I discourage dissent when
it doesn't go with the things that I want.
So, I want you to be honest with me. I won't hold it against you.
How many of you think I should sign the bill?
Thank you.
You have all worked very hard to get AmWorks up and running.
I don't want to sign its death warrant
until we have exhausted every resource available to us first.
So I need every department to draft a proposal
of what they could do in response to the hurricane.
And if we still fall short, I'll sign the bill.
Is that okay with everyone?
Let's aim for the day after tomorrow. Thank you all very much.
The starting salary for an employee at Walmart
is below the poverty line.
Now, the American government subsidizes Walmart
to the tune of   billion dollars a year,
by issuing food stamps to
over one in ten of its workers.
But here's the scary part.
Fifteen percent of all food stamps are actually used at Walmart.
Meaning Walmart
gets to double dip into the federal government's coffers.
I'm as angry about it as you are.
Because Walmart's top executives have reaped
almost  million
in tax-deductible performance pay over the last six years.
That needs to stop!
We need to raise the minimum wage!
Cut down on corporate greed by regulating bonuses.
It's time to balance the scales.
Can we go through your call sheet?
Just give me a second to decompress.
We've only got a half hour until the next event.
  Doug called?   While you were giving your speech.
  What about?   He wouldn't say.
How'd it go in Cedar Rapids?
Well. We got AFSCME on board.
Good turnout. What's up?
Sharp has an event in Dubuque tomorrow.
You're scheduled to be there too.
  And?   Meet with her.
  Somewhere discreet.   Why?
If we assume that Underwood is running, and we do,
we should also assume that Sharp is on his team.
That doesn't answer the question.
I'm sure that Cynthia will object. Hello, Cynthia.
  Hello, Doug.   Object to what?
You're going to talk to Sharp about the hurricane.
...that are perceived as helping average citizens
feel more empowered.
Who are some of the bill's key opponents
and what are hearing in their on floor messaging?
Well, the White House would be the most prominent opponent
if they slap the veto threat on this, saying it's  
  Oh. Thank you, Cynthia.   You usually work out at midnight?
My workout is the only time of day
the press corps gives me some privacy.
  How did your event go tonight?   Fine.
I called bingo for half an hour at an old folks' home.
Well, that's pretty good. Something a little different.
You gonna steal it the way you stole
my talking points on the FEMA bill?
You made good points.
I'm not above agreeing with the opposition when they're right.
But I'm surprised you've been so critical.
I thought you and Underwood were close.
I'm not above disagreeing with an ally when they're wrong.
In the spirit of what's right,
I want you to know I'm suspending my campaign.
When the storm makes landfall,
I'm going to ask people to donate to the Red Cross instead.
And I'll be heading out east to volunteer.
That doesn't sound like a suspension.
That sounds like opportunism.
No. I'll ask the press to leave me be.
I can't force them to, but we won't offer any logistical support.
You want me to suspend as well?
We can announce together.
That takes the politics out of this.
The cynical side of me thinks that it benefits you
if I stop my fundraising right when I'm hitting my stride.
Well, I'm not appealing to the cynical side.
I'll leave you to your workout.
You have kids now.
I have a husband. He has kids.
You don't consider them your own?
It's late, Heather.
I bring it up because they ground me.
I don't know if you've
felt this way since you got married, but...
when I think about my kids and this hurricane...
What if we didn't have the money and advantages we do?
What if they were in harm's way?
What if they needed help and didn't have it?
Puts everything into perspective for me.
This... campaign seems meaningless.
It pales in comparison to their well-being.
Have you felt that at all?
Since you became a mother?
"Consulting with state governments" is way too dry.
Put in "Working closely."
  Don't you think that's disingenuous?   Why?
These seven governors just publicly condemned the president.
"Working closely"?
Well, I condemn you every day but I still work closely with you.
So, I need to take this phone call.
Punch it up, bring it back to me.
  Doug?   I have a message for the president.
What is it?
Tell him Jackie and Dunbar met in Dubuque tonight.
And tell him I'm the one who told you.
What did they meet about?
Suspending their campaigns after the hurricane hits.
  How do you know this?   Just tell him.
Are you working for Jackie, under the radar?
  No.   Dunbar?
I'm just looking out for the president.
Give him the information and tell him who it came from.
I'll let you know if I learn more.
"The water was cold and the current was strong.
With every stroke, the boy had to fight off chills
and battle the tide rushing in from the sea.
Anyone watching him, as his schoolmates did from the shore,
barely making out a tiny speck moving slowly across the water,
would've thought he stood no chance.
But that thought never entered the boy's mind.
His muscles ached, his heart pounded,
but the water would not defeat him."
I want rec centers and town halls,
but the most important thing is schools.
They're the key.
Well, every school east of Ohio.
You tell the governors that push back,
tell them we'll pay for the shutdown days
and overtime with what's left in the DRF.
No, we'll figure out how to
get people there through some other department.
Just get me the schools!
I keep telling them to stop bringing those.
I know. I got these myself.
Oh, thank you. That's sweet.
  Any progress?   Some, but not enough.
Did you mean it today, when you raised your hand?
No.
But I knew if I did,
the others who wanted to would be less afraid.
Is that it? The bill?
Yes. They delivered it just after the cabinet meeting.
Maybe I should just sign the damn thing.
The longer I wait, the bigger target I become.
Well, the cabinet's working hard.
Stick to your guns and give them some time.
Well, it could turn. Or dissipate.
Hurricane Humberto was on the same trajectory as Faith.
Everyone thought that was gonna wipe out seven states,
but in the end, it turned south
and never became more than a Cat One.
  How good are the chances?   Extremely poor.
But... there's still some hope.
Relax for a minute, Francis.
We should cancel the UN ceremony tomorrow.
  What?   Maybe it sends the wrong message.
No, it's a great victory for you. For us.
But celebrating in the middle of a crisis, I don't  
Well, that's exactly what we should be doing.
You made this resolution happen.
It's the one good notch we have
on our belt since we moved into the White House.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let this hurricane rob us of that.
"When Congress refused to support a peacekeeping mission
in the Jordan Valley, the president deployed troops anyway,
stating his authority as Commander in Chief."
"The ramparts of the fort were still a mile away.
But he had reached the point of no return.
Turning back was no longer an option."
"With the world's eyes upon him,
he continues to ignore precedent,
convention, and some would say the law."
"Why did he cross that invisible line?
Why risk his life
despite the great odds stacked against him?"
"Critics have been harsh. And yet most have stopped
a tyrant."
"What drove Napoleon to keep marching toward Moscow?
Or Hannibal to cross the Alps?"
"The warning signs are there.
It's our responsibility to heed them."
"What kept a young Frank Underwood
swimming onward?
And what kept him from drowning?"
How did Seth learn this?
  Jackie's comms director.   And this happened last night?
From what I can gather.
So why am I just hearing about it now?
I didn't hear about it before it happens.
Obviously, she was trying to keep it a secret.
But you're supposed to be keeping tabs on her.
The fact that you didn't know, and only found out from Seth  
I'm not in Iowa, sir.
I'm here running your staff.
Excuse me?
Just because Jackie and I have a personal history
doesn't mean I know her every movement.
We are not talking about your ex-girlfriend.
We're talking about my running mate.
And if she can't be trusted,
I can't force her to reveal things she doesn't want to.
You are the one who convinced me
to make the deal with her in the first place.
We needed information. She had access.
And now she's lying to us.
Maybe you should speak with her before we consider this a crisis.
I don't like your tone, Remy.
  You're blowing this out of proportion.   Watch yourself.
When I worked for you in Congress,
you always told me to be straight up with you.
I wasn't the president then.
So you just want me to apologize and be a yes-man?
I want you to treat this office with respect.
You owe your staff that same respect.
I gave you a position in the White House
when no one would touch you.
I don't owe you a damn thing.
How long you gonna hang that over my head?
Oh, it's like you want me to fire you.
You couldn't, and you know it.
Not right now.
Seth and I are the only two soldiers you have.
  Get Jackie on the phone.   Yes, sir.
Sir, Congresswoman Sharp calling for you.
I'll take it in here.
Sir, we'll gladly polish those for you.
I'm happy to do it myself. Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Congresswoman.
I apologize if you hear chewing.
This is the first chance
I've gotten to eat all day. Non-stop events.
I'm surprised you have an appetite after meeting with Dunbar.
Her people asked. I said yes.
I thought I'd see what she wanted before bothering you with it.
Suspending your campaigns? I'm assuming that you told her no.
I told her yes.
You realize she's just
preying upon your good nature to stop your fundraising.
Even if that were the case, the politics work in my favor too.
It's insensitive to campaign during a catastrophe this big.
It could backfire on me.
We don't know that it's going to be a catastrophe.
Weathermen can be wrong, Mr. President,
but not every weatherman in the country.
All right, even if that's true,
you should attack her
for using the hurricane to score sympathy points.
I've discussed it with my staff.
This isn't just your campaign, Jackie,
this is our campaign.
May I offer you some advice, sir?
Sign the bill.
If you don't, and the storm hits,
you and I won't have a campaign.
You should get back to your dinner.
Hey, everyone. Let's put down the dishes for a second.
I need to talk to you.
Here's the deal.
I hired you three under America Works.
And as much as we can use the manpower,
I can't afford it if the program gets ended.
I might be able to afford to keep two of you if you split shifts,
but I can't keep all three.
"A storm has been forming not for weeks,
but for decades.
Its name is not Faith, it's Francis.
The entire nation is in his path,
and if we ignore the warning signs,
we have no one but ourselves to blame."
It's not an article. It's an opinion piece.
I know.
The paper can't take this editorial stance.
  It's too speculative.   I'm aware.
Print it as a column.
The moment I do that, you cross over to the other side.
We can't keep you on your beat.
So replace me.
I want a column. It's time.
Kate, you're on track to be managing editor.
You toss that out the window
the moment you switch over to being a columnist.
I don't want to be editing other people's words.
I want to be writing my own.
And not just the news, I want my ideas out there.
Look. You know the Telegraph will let you do anything you want.
But we need you reporting on the President.
  Nobody does it better.   My bias is clear.
You shouldn't keep me on as a reporter anyway.
I'll tell you what. We can make this work as an analysis piece.
You tone down the speculation, stick to the facts and quotes  
  Speculation is the entire point.   Fine.
Just...
give me a little something from the other side, to balance it out.
You know they're not gonna give me a quote.
Even if it's a source just
tangentially associated with the administration.
You do that,
we can print this and keep you as a reporter.
I got an idea who I can talk to.
"On another day, with warmer water,
with the current carrying him,
he might have made it.
But on this day,
he would only make it halfway before his arms gave out
and the numbness overtook him, before the coast guard
pulled him out of the water despite his protests.
Was he reckless? Was he foolish?
Possibly.
One thing can't be denied, however.
What others saw as impossible, he refused to believe as such.
The water proved him wrong. He fell far short of the other shore.
And yet he made the attempt.
And that... is everything."
That's just the prologue.
You don't mention America Works once.
On purpose.
That is what the book is supposed to be about, isn't it?
You don't like it?
I do like it. I just wonder if I...
Well, maybe I don't... understand what you're trying to do.
Nobody cares about an idea.
They might care about a man with an idea.
I only care about the man.
The whole book will be like this... these vignettes.
Like a collection of short stories.
Do you mention AmWorks anywhere?
Nope.
Not once.
I did want the book to be different,
but I... It just seems that that might  
I think it might be the best thing I've written in years.
It could also be utter and complete shit.
But when I can't tell the difference, it's usually a good sign.
I just don't want to lose sight of the bigger goal.
I don't know any other way to write it.
If you want something different,
now's the time to find somebody else.
No, I want you to finish it.
Even though I have...
no idea if it will end up being relevant if I end up...
signing this bill.
Are you going to?
I don't know yet.
If I do, of course,
I'll pay you in full if the book becomes unnecessary.
I'm not doing this for the paycheck.
What do you think?
Should I sign it?
Well, I have skin in the game.
So the selfish part of me says no.
But...
honestly?
No book is worth people losing their lives.
Yes, but it's not just about the book.
It's about putting people back to work.
People can't work if they're dead.
Well, I'm gonna obviously be very occupied
by this hurricane for the foreseeable future.
Let me think on this for...
You'd better not fuck him over.
  Excuse me?   With what you're writing.
I don't intend to.
  The part about being foolish?   You eavesdropping?
  He's not foolish.   That wasn't my point.
I wouldn't take a bullet for a man who was.
Let's go, your car's waiting.
As of tomorrow,
Congresswoman Sharp and I are suspending our campaigns.
We will be traveling to areas affected by Hurricane Faith,
along with our campaign staff,
in order to volunteer in whatever capacity is most helpful.
We're also suspending any donations,
and urge our supporters to donate to the Red Cross
and other hurricane relief agencies.
In times of suffering, it's important to suspend politics
and do what's best for the country.
We look forward to resuming our campaigns
when the storm has cleared
and the people of the east coast are safe.
That was democratic precedencial candidate...
Freddy?
The President would like to see you, Mr. Hayes.
I still got two hours left on my shift.
It's fine, Freddy. You can go.
Do you mind if I bring my grandson?
Daycare got shut down 'cause of the storm.
Of course. We got a car waiting.
Come on, DeShawn.
We going to see the president.
Freddy.
  It's good to see you, Frank.   Thank you for coming.
And this must be DeShawn. How are you, sir?
That is a firm handshake you have.
Well, you want to go over and sit at the desk?
Go ahead.
Yeah, I do that too, sometimes.
That desk might be yours one day.
Would you like to be the president?
Yeah.
Well, to be president, you have to get good grades in school.
Now, I see you brought some of your schoolwork with you.
I have an office just around the corner in here,
maybe you'd like to go do your work in there.
Or we also have a PlayStation if you'd rather play that.
  What games you got?   Oh, we have plenty of games.
Meechum will show you.
What can I get for you?
Coffee, a soda, a beer?
  No, I'm good, thank you.   Please sit down.
  You signed up for America Works.   I did.
I've got , case studies just like yours.
And I also have a bill on my desk
that's gonna cut the funding for all ,.
Yeah, I been following on the news.
I'm gonna sign it.
There's too many lives at stake with this storm.
Sounds like the right thing to do.
Freddy, you deserve a job,
and Congress is forcing me to take it away.
I've spoken to our head of operations,
and if you want it, there's a job for you here.
  Now, it's not charity, but     What's the pay?
Well, I don't know the exact figures,
but I figure somewhere around three grand a month.
  I know that's not great, but I     Healthcare?
Well, yes, of course. That's included.
  For DeShawn, too?   That's right. All dependents.
  What's the job?   The kitchen.
Helping prep food for the chefs.
Well, as long as it's, you know, above , a month.
That's what I need to make my rent
and make sure DeShawn has everything he needs.
I'll put you in touch with the head chef right away.
I was wondering... if you had anything else?
  Besides the kitchen.   Well, I just assumed that  
I've been working in kitchens my whole life.
Just 'cause I owned a rib joint don't mean I like working in 'em.
Well, what would you rather do?
You got groundskeepers out there.
I noticed 'em choppin' branches when we were driving in,
for the hurricane.
You'd prefer that?
Always wanted to work outside.
Well, I'm sure that something can be arranged.
I want to be president one day.
  Well, that's never gonna happen.   But he said I could be.
Listen up, boy. He lied to you.
The truth is, you ain't never gonna be president.
It's just like them basketball players you got posters of.
They say you can do anything, be a superstar, too.
But they were born to be seven feet tall and if they wasn't,
tell me what would they have?
Nothing.
Half of them can't even read a damn book.
No, boy, this place ain't for you and me.
It's good to have dreams, just so long as they're not fantasies.
You let anybody sell you that shit, it's your own damn fault.
  You hear me?   Yeah, I hear you, Pop.
I'll get it to the House right away.
  Green light on the release?   Yes.
I don't remember giving you my phone number.
You didn't. Your publisher did.
He wants me to write a book.
I'm surprised you never have.
I'm sure any book you wrote would do ten times what mine do.
Not as much as Scorpio.
As any I've written since.
I read it in college.
Did it change your life?
That's what you hear all day long, isn't it?
If I still got recognized on the street, which I don't.
Mostly at book signings,
which I don't recommend if you write your book.
I didn't ask you here to discuss my book.
  No?   I want to discuss yours.
I'm working on a piece, and it won't go to print
unless I get a comment from the White House.
I'm not a part of the White House.
Doesn't even have to be a quote,
just something... that I can paraphrase, like,
"According to someone close to the administration..."
Doesn't have to be on the record.
I'm not commenting on the book.
Tom, you got access no one else has.
For a reason. 'Cause he knows I won't talk.
Especially to you.
Well, can I buy you a drink?
Getting me drunk won't work.
You came out to meet me here. I owe you one.
Why don't I buy you a drink?
How about we have a few?
A few.
I can live with that.
I'm so sorry, Francis. I know how hard this is.
It was out of my hands. I can't control the weather.
Still.
What frustrates me more than anything
is we were starting to turn the ship.
I was getting support in Congress. A few more months...
and the leadership would've had no choice
but to support America Works.
Well, if it's any solace, Cathy just called.
The Russians are willing to contribute troops.
To the peacekeeping force?
They don't want to be left out.
No catch, no conditions?
None. There's too much pressure on them in the UN.
So the isolation worked.
They're sending  troops.
That's incredible.
  We did it.   Oh, no, not we. It was all you.
  Join me for dinner?   I'm gonna turn in.
This early, huh?
I'm gonna be up three straight days once this hurricane hits.
I need to get all the sleep I can.
That's a good idea. I'll leave you be.
Have one of the stewards wake me when it hits the coast.
Francis.
Francis?
Where did it make landfall?
  It didn't.   What?
The hurricane turned.
It's due east now. It might hit Bermuda.
But it'll, uh,
dissipate quickly now that it's reaching colder water.
It looks like we dodged a bullet, Mr. President.
I barely got the money in time for a halfway decent response.
How do we pull back on the bill?
Already delivered to Congress, we put out a release.
There must be some parliamentary procedure
that will nullify my signature.
I checked with the White House counsel.
The bill is officially law
and the money's already been appropriated.
FEMA is assisting thousands of evacuees returning to their homes.
With the exception of moderate flooding in Georgia
due to rain from the outer bands,
the rest of the Eastern Seaboard was left virtually untouched
by the hurricane everyone expected to be the storm of the century.
The biggest casualty to Faith was not life or property, however,
but rather President Underwood's
controversial America Works plan,
which Congress defunded in order to free up resources
for storm-related disaster relief.
The president himself signed the emergency appropriation into law
after facing immense pressure from both parties and the media.
So you're out of a job, I guess.
Probably. Wouldn't be the first time.
If it makes you feel any better,
there's no way my story'll get printed now.
Why? Because I wouldn't give you a quote?
No, it was a whole hurricane metaphor.
Kind of takes the wind out of the sails if there's no hurricane.
at least you got laid.
Yep. That... that's poetic.
Yeah. I'm a writer.
  What is it?   I gotta go.
Is that your way of getting rid of me?
No. It's the president.
I'm gonna need the shirt back.
If you asked me over to let me go, it wasn't necessary.
  But I appreciate the thoughtfulness.   I'm not letting you go.
This book is more important now than ever.
But... America Works is done.
Well, there's only one way to get it back on track.
I'm announcing my candidacy for .
I couldn't run before.
I didn't have the money
and I didn't have the leadership's backing.
But now that I've proven what AmWorks can do,
the money and the support will be there.
A vote for Frank Underwood is a vote for America Works.
  You were right.   How was I right?
Come over here, take a look out the window.
You see that man working over there?
  That's Freddy Hayes.   The ribs guy?
  He's a groundskeeper now.   That's generous of you.
No, it wasn't. It's my job.
You wrote that I refuse to see the impossible as impossible.
Freddy is one job.
I have ten million more to go.
That's my story and that's why you were right.
So you wanna get back to work?
I'm in.
Now? I don't have my notebook.
The pen I signed the bill with.
All right. Let's do it.
I never tried to swim to Fort Sumter.
Thomas probably knows I made it up, but he wrote about it anyway

imagination is its own form of courage.
Let's talk more about that swim.
I really did come this close to drowning.House.of.Cards.SE
Well, the president just saw me come.
  You don't like my giraffe?   No.
You know I'm divorced twice
and have a daughter in college, right?
  It's on your Wikipedia page.   Wikipedia.
Christ.
I don't have any expectations.
I never have, of anyone.
You shouldn't either.
How many events have we skipped today?
Three so far.
And we're about to skip a fourth.
  All on the Telegraph's dime.   Hey, I'm a free agent.
Means I'm free to bail on a speech
I've already seen ten thousand times.
You are entitled...
  to nothing.   Stop.
Let me be clear. I say, I say...
Come here, boy.
You are entitled...
To nothing!
Now, here's the truth: The American dream is broken.
And when we are robbed of our dreams,
well, let me ask you, folks, what are we left with?
Nothing!
And when I asked Congress to help me take this country
from a welfare state to a fully-employed nation,
what did Congress do?
Nothing!
And when we proved that America Works actually works,
when we created , jobs in Washington DC,
Congress didn't just stop at nothing,
they killed progress in its tracks.
Believe me, I know how you feel.
But we have to remember why we're here.
We have to turn that anger into action.
Ma'am, it's Secretary Durant,
  she said it's urgent.   America Works will succeed,
but we need your help.
Hello?
You need to let them know that a vote for Frank Underwood
is a vote for America Works!
A vote for Frank Underwood is a vote for America Works!
Now, I had the great pleasure
of meeting a woman this morning named Gloria.
She has a degree from Iowa State University
and even with her degree, she can't get employed.
Now, why? Why is that the case?
Becau   My wife, ladies and gentlemen.
I think what my wife is gently
trying to tell me is that I've run overtime.
She has a very clever nickname for me.
  "Verbosity."   Yeah.
Now, the main difference between Claire and me,
aside from her stunning beauty, of course,
is that she actually knows what that word means.
Now, look, I would love to stay here all afternoon
and answer all your questions,
but then I'd leave all your friends
in Cedar Rapids waiting for me
even longer than they have and we don't want to do that.
So I want to thank you all for coming out to see me today,
to hear about this battle, this fight we're in.
I want you to caucus for me,
and let's help get Gloria a job!
America Works only if you make it work!
God bless Iowa! God bless the United States of America!
  Thank you!   Underwood! Underwood! Underwood!
An IED right off Route ,
three kilometers from the Jordan River.
  When?   Thirty-six minutes ago.
Russian unit was on patrol. Two armored vehicles were destroyed.
  All eight troops were killed.   Who's Cathy spoken to?
Foreign Minister hasn't returned her call.
We have to make sure the Secretary General doesn't say anything
until we have a better handle on this.
Remy, I need to speak to Petrov immediately.
I contacted the Kremlin. They said he'll reach out soon.
We need the UN to investigate the blast site.
The Russians have cordoned it off. They're not letting anyone in.
  Why not?   We don't know.
We had a unit nearby that heard the blast, went in to help.
  Russians turned them away.   I don't like the feel of this.
Cathy says the Israelis want to send in their own team.
We can't let that happen.
The second Israeli boots hit the ground  
Remy, I don't care what you have to do,
you get Petrov on the phone.
We need to head this off at the pass.
And make sure no one in Congress overreacts either.
How was the game?
Great, until my phone started blowing up.
Let me see what you have so far.
No.
This is no good. The language is too obtuse.
  Simpler. More direct.   Look, here's the deal:
If the Russians don't play ball, the Israelis will get nervous.
If the Israelis send troops in, the Palestinians will go apeshit.
If the Palestinians go apeshit, there could be mortar attacks.
And if there are mortar attacks, the whole peacekeeping mission
  could go down the drain.   You want me to actually say that?
God, no. We need to say the opposite.
Look, make it as clear as
the doomsday scenario that I just described,
but then flip it around and put a happy face on it.
We can reschedule everything else,
but I'm concerned about Harlan Traub.
The IDP Chairman.
And President of the Food Processors Association.
He's big for us statewide.
We were supposed to meet with him tonight.
Well, this is a national security emergency.
He hasn't met with Dunbar yet.
If we cancel, she gets a clean shot at him.
All right, so put him on the plane.
FEC rules.
Campaigning on Air Force One costs , an hour.
  Aside from the message it sends     Alright. So I won't campaign.
I won't have time anyway. Uh, just make him feel special.
Give him some face time in Washington.
Anything?
Moryakov's office is giving me the runaround.
An IED has killed eight Russian troops
on patrol in the Jordan Valley.
So far, no one has claimed responsibility for this attack.
The only reaction from the Kremlin, a brief written statement
from Foreign Minister Bugayev that reads, quote,
"The perpetrators will be found and brought to justice." End quote.
  Wheels up in  minutes.   I gotta grab my bags from my room.
  Okay. Meet me out front.   We should take separate cars.
A cab won't even get here before the plane takes off.
You're coming with me.
Yes, sir.
Not a good day to play hooky.
It's gonna be a late night here.
It depends what Petrov does.
So far, just incredibly loud silence.
I gotta go, hon. Foreign Affairs is holding an emergency session.
I love you, too.
  I don't have much time.   Neither do I.
Talking points.
These make me uncomfortable.
Even in a closed session, whatever I say will get out.
  I'll take hits in Iowa.   You can't criticize the mission.
We need you to keep everyone calm.
You know how I feel about unnecessary military involvement.
You asked to be on the ticket, Jackie.
It's been non-stop resistance from the start.
If you don't want to support the president,
you shouldn't want to be his number two.
I'm sick of pulling teeth.
You're right. I'll do what I can.
Jackie...
I didn't mean to snap.
I know it's hard having a presence here
and campaigning at the same time.
I'm sure it's tough on Alan and the kids, too.
Alan's been a big help, actually.
I'm glad he's stepping up, giving you the support you need.
I thought I would hate it, the whole marriage thing.
But it's nice.
When I can get home, everyone around the table.
I even cook sometimes.
  Badly, but they indulge me.   No.
  I have my June Cleaver moments.   Apron and all?
Don't push it.
I can't remember the last time I had a home-cooked meal.
  Session's about to start.   Yeah.
I'll fill you in after.
Tom.
  Where have you been all day?   Sorry. Working on the book.
I know we were supposed to have an opportunity to speak,
  but obviously now, it's     Of course.
Listen, you can come up and sit up front if you like.
  I spoke to Claire about it.   I'm fine back here. Thanks.
Okay.
I need to know this passport lock is being lifted.
Show me what you got.
I'm tired of being strung along.
  You have a location?   Yeah. But I want a timeline.
  Week or two.   No.
They've stopped giving me new assignments.
That means they're getting ready to fuck me.
It has to happen sooner than that.
What are you doing?
E-mailing a friend in Homeland.
He always gets back to me quickly.
You satisfied?
Rachel.
  It says Jane Doe.   No, it's her.
It's her.
She ghosted the identity of a girl named Rebecca Sands.
The birthday's pretty close.
It's August , then she died in ',
along with her whole family.
But her social went active about six months ago.
But this doesn't say Rebecca Sands. It says Jane Doe.
State troopers found her body in a ditch,
in an abandoned construction site outside of Tucson.
I mean, there's no   There's no picture.
There's no proof of anything.
"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God
by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger
and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you."
No.
  No, no. That's not her.   Come on, man. There's fingerprints.
Fingerprints from the Tale of Two Cities book that you gave me.
I ran it against the autopsy report.
It was a ten-point match with Jane Doe.
I need the passport lock lifted now.
  I'm on it.   When will you be on it?
  Soon.   Soon? How soon?
As soon as I can!
I did my part. Get the lock lifted.
You've reached Seth Grayson.
Leave a message, I'll get back to you.
I need to see him.
My mother died.
Come on!
Are you okay?
Hey, man. What the fuck?
Sorry.
You believe this guy?
You want to say it to her, shithead?
Sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.
  Drinks on me.   We don't want drinks, shithead.
You need to get out of here. Tommy, this guy's trashed.
Here. Drinks on me.
No, no. We don't want drinks. We want you to leave.
Come on. Just take it. I said I was sorry.
  I don't give a shit.   Take it.
No, he's apologizing. I'm telling you.
Sorry.
  Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!   I will bust your fucking face!
  Calm down. Let me get you a cab.   Okay.
Hello, everyone. I'm afraid I don't have much news.
We are in touch, uh, with the Russians,
but there's very few details.
I'm waiting to speak with President Petrov.
  Any reason for the delay?   He just lost eight soldiers.
Talking to their families is his priority
as it would be mine.
Do you think this could jeopardize the peacekeeping mission?
Well, every country that contributed troops
knew that something like this was a possibility.
But the Russians fought this plan hard.
This gives Petrov the perfect out.
I wouldn't presume to know what President Petrov is thinking.
I'll know more once we have a chance to speak.
What about Congress? They weren't fans of this mission.
I'm gonna consult with congressional leadership
as soon as we get back.
In the meantime, my focus
is to help the Russians in any way that I can.
How can you help them when they won't let anyone near the blast site?
Well, that hasn't been confirmed.
Unless, of course,
you have better intelligence than the Pentagon.
Thank you all very much. More soon.
Israel wants to go public, blame Palestine for the attack.
There's no evidence yet.
Yes, well, the message is that
Palestine should be keeping its people in check.
They've also moved  troops to a staging area
across the border from Beit She'an.
Christ. Try the Kremlin again, please.
You try yawning?
That works for you, not for me.
What about some water? Sometimes that helps.
I don't need water, I need a phone call.
Maybe you should talk to Traub
while you're waiting for that phone call.
  You're not eating?   I'm not hungry.
I think you don't like to fly.
Holding onto that table like it's a stripper's tits.
Harlan. I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
Please, don't get up. How's your lobster?
It tastes like it was caught this morning.
Well, it was. Nothing but the best for Air Force One.
Sir, I know you have a million things on your mind,
but I would just love to talk to you about how to modernize
the food-processing industry in Iowa.
Please, slit my wrists with his butter knife.
We can't talk election on the plane, Harlan.
That's an FEC no-no.
This isn't about the campaign.
We're talking about the economy, not the caucus. Right, Harlan?
That's right.
I'm sure you're aware, sir, that we lead the states
in corn and soybean production.
It's a good thing, given the trend towards vegan.
But our food-processing plants  
  Well, the largest industry in Iowa.   That's correct.
And they're slow on the uptake, sir.
We need federal funding to help subsidize
  the transition toward healthier     Mr. President.
our call from Russia.
Oh. I'm so sorry. I have to take this.
But Harlan, we'll get into it, I promise.
Viktor, it's a terrible tragedy, Mr. President.
I feel for your loss.
This is why your people were so persistent?
So you could offer your sympathy?
It's important that we talk.
You're not letting anyone near the blast site.
We're conducting our investigation.
Well, is there anything wrong with allowing UN investigators
to work in conjunction with your people?
UN Command sent my men on that patrol,
the most dangerous stretch of Route  in the entire valley.
  And you sent my men.   Me? What are you talking about?
You saw my men as expendable.
Viktor, I don't personally oversee the peacekeeping forces,
and you can't possibly think
that there was some deliberate attempt
  to put your men in harm's way.   So I am to believe, what?
That this was a random act of fate, yes?
Listen, whoever's responsible,
we can't let them foment distrust between us.
If we do, then they win.
Let's show them that an incident like this makes us stronger.
Let us help you find out who did this.
Russians are dead. Russia will find the killers.
I don't understand why you're refusing our assistance.
Because we don't need it.
Well, can we at least keep the dialogue open?
Consult with each other before you make any move?
I'm going to do what I must, Mr. President.
Viktor, please listen to me. We have  
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but the line has been disconnected.
He hung up on me.
Cathy Durant, please.
Baldwin was right.
Those eight bodies give Petrov options.
He's not shedding tears, he's popping champagne corks.
I can hear them.
Not here. Sir. Restroom's this way.
Who was that? The guy who just came in?
Didn't see him.
I would've come to your office.
This is the only room at the UN we don't monitor.
  I'm assuming you don't either.   No, we haven't bugged it.
  So we can speak openly.   I think we should.
You talk. I'll listen.
Palestine says it can't control Hamas
if Israeli troops cross into the valley.
We have to back channel this, Alexi.
Petrov won't listen to Francis.
Alexi, please. This whole thing, you can't let it devolve
into something nobody can control.
Well, maybe that was the objective.
What was?
The President... never wanted the peacekeeping mission.
You said "Objective."
Are you telling me this was somehow planned?
I haven't said anything.
But you want to.
The whole world wants to know who is responsible.
Your troops won't let anyone near the blast site.
Because they don't want the world to know.
My brother... he's in the FSB.
We spoke a week ago. I haven't heard from him since.
Are you absolutely certain about this?
Alexi, go public.
We'll protect you.
Like you did Xander Feng?
That was different.
I have a family.
The FSB has conducted these sorts of operations before.
The apartment complex that blew up,,
Petrov used that to justify invading Chechnya.
The opera house that was gassed,
he removed all provincial governors after that.
We do believe the FSB participated in the first.
We're still uncertain about the opera house.
But blowing up his own soldiers,
I find that very difficult to believe.
Did he tell you point blank? Did he say the words?
He said as much as he could.
But the implication was crystal clear.
I'm sure he was very convincing.
All Russian diplomats go through
FSB counter-intel training.
They're trying to provoke some sort of reaction out of us.
But what about his brother?
It is true that his brother works for the FSB,
and that we lost track of him last week.
That part of the story holds up.
What's our profile on Moryakov?
We have our agent who's been assigned to him, sir. Jim?
Moryakov has been considered a bit of a wild card in Moscow.
Petrov considered recalling him twice,
but held off because his father's a family friend.
Now, we picked up some chatter in recent months,
his misgivings with how the Kremlin's been handling the Jordan Valley.
But does he strike you as a traitor?
He's a complicated man. Fiercely nationalistic.
But he definitely has doubts about Petrov.
Shouldn't we at least entertain the possibility?
Yeah, but how can we determine it
one way or the other? Definitively?
Our satellites aren't enough.
We'd have to get men to the blast site,
retrieve soil samples and blast debris.
How soon could we get a team in?
I'd estimate  hours.
Well, three days seems an awfully long time.
Don't we already have the basics in place for deployment?
That doesn't take into account the Russian forces.
We'd want better intel before deploying.
Am I correct in assuming that every hour that passes,
our chances of retrieving any proof diminish?
That is correct, sir.
What's the absolute soonest you can deploy?
Twelve hours, Mr. President.
But that would involve an extremely high degree  
Yeah, I'm aware of the risk, Admiral.
What are the odds of success?
Honestly, sir, without proper intelligence,
I can't say better than  .
You're certain?
Yes, I am.
Let's put it in motion.
  Mr. President?   Mark.
Shouldn't the UN be conducting the investigation
instead of the Russians?
The Russians have been our partners
in this mission from day one of deployment,
so I would say that they're conducting their own investigation on behalf
of the United Nations, not instead of.
  Mr. President?   Sara.
Is it correct to say that
they are in no way reporting to UN Command?
In peacekeeping missions, nations volunteer their forces.
They answer to their own governments first and foremost,
then they cooperate with the UN Command.
That's an important distinction to make.
Now, any other questions with respect to the Jordan Valley
should be directed to the State Department.
But if any of you have questions
that don't relate to yesterday's events,
I'll take one or two. Yeah, Stephanie.
Mr. President, Kate and I both had a question.
Thank you, Stephanie.
Mr. President, are you aware, sir,
that campaigning on Air Force One
  is a violation of FEC rules?   Yes, in general, I am.
Harlan Traub was on the plane yesterday.
It's hard to imagine he was there
for any other reason than you'd be seeking his support in Iowa.
You don't know how long I've known him,
and yes, he was on the plane yesterday.
But it's not a violation if you don't campaign, which I didn't.
I think the extent of our conversation
was asking him how he liked his meal.
But I'm happy to let the FEC decide.
Now, does anybody else have any question
that somebody else asked them to ask me?
Where's Traub now?
At the Hay-Adams. Should be here in an hour.
It'd be bad if anyone saw him at the White House.
Well, I don't even want him in DC now.
The last thing we need is some bullshit FEC story
while I'm trying to deal with the Russians.
Let's get him back to Iowa. And you handle this.
You have better people skills than Vaughn.
And you talk to Baldwin.
You make it crystal clear we violated no regulations.
Sir? I got a voicemail from Doug last night.
  He said his mom died.   My God, that's awful.
Except Julia Stamper passed away ten years ago.
I know, I was at the funeral.
Send some flowers. Actually, get Doug in here.
I'd like to give my condolences in person.
There's a whole host of ways
we can revolutionize food processing in Iowa
through America Works.
The subsidies you want for R and D
  can be financed as a jobs     You don't have to do this.
  Do what?   Sweet talk me.
And a cab would've been fine.
I wanted to drive to the airport myself
so we had a chance to talk about your concerns.
Well, I'm used to talking to candidates, not chauffeurs.
I'm not a chauffeur.
Well, it's your hands on the wheel.
Seth?
Shit.
Registration and insurance, please.
I'm sorry, officer. I left my wallet at work.
Registration? Proof of insurance?
  In my wallet.   You're supposed to keep it in the car.
Yeah. But if someone steals your car, why give 'em the paperwork?
All right,
I'm gonna need you to step out of the car for a moment, please.
Officer, my name is Remy Danton.
I'm Chief of Staff to the president.
Without your identification, sir, I don't know who you are.
  Got my government pin.   That doesn't matter, sir.
I still need to see your identification.
Would you step out of the car, please?
Officer, you run a search on Remy Danton, you'll get my photo.
Sir, I asked you to step out of the car. Please.
  Any weapons on you?   Of course not.
All right. You mind stepping to the rear of the vehicle, please?
I'm gonna pat you down, just to make sure.
Feet back.
Car comes back to a Virginia corporation, no address.
I'm cleared Top Secret, my information is masked.
Sir, I need you to stay here for a moment, please.
  What do you got?   No address on file.
  Why'd you stop me?   One moment, sir.
No, not one moment.
I got the right to know why you stopped me.
Sir, I asked you to keep your hands on the car.
I'm gonna need your badge number.
Trying to show off for your partner here, brother?
I'm not your brother. Don't make us restrain you.
  Officer Davis.   Sir.
Officer Corchoran.
Know what? I'm gonna take a photo.
What the fuck?!
  What's your problem?!   Calm down!
Sir!
I'm gonna need your badge number!
Mr. Danton, I'm Lieutenant Hixson.
I'm very sorry for this misunderstanding.
Watch your head.
I hope you accept my apology on their behalf.
  They said I was stopped for speeding.   Yes.
When they encounter someone without a license and registration  
Write up the ticket.
You don't have to worry about that, sir. You're free to go.
If I was speeding, give me the damn ticket.
That's really not necessary after everything we put you through.
Lieutenant.
I'd invite you up, but the kids, they're  
We're bringing them to Iowa this trip
and it's a total shit-show.
I didn't come here to talk to you about the campaign.
I probably... you know,
I shouldn't have just shown up like this, but...
Here. Come this way.
It's stupid. I don't even know why I came over.
Did something happen?
I got pulled over. For speeding.
Things got out of hand. A nigger in a nice car.
Jesus.
I left my wallet at work.
When I tried to tell the guy who I was,
he didn't believe me, so...
I don't know.
I didn't believe me.
There I was with my hands in cuffs and it was like, uh...
it was like I was outside of myself.
I could've been anyone.
I wasn't me.
  Does that make any sense?   You got rattled.
No, it's not that.
I look at you and Alan, and even Frank and Claire.
This happened and I didn't have anyone to tell about it.
You have me, right?
I'm glad you came over.
It's not fair. Intruding on you like this.
If I thought you were intruding, I wouldn't have come downstairs.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I  
You still mean a lot to me.
I am there for you, as your friend.
You should go back up. Finish packing.
Safe flight.
We're set to insert at  EST,
We'll use a Fulton recovery
of any material samples.
The extraction?
The team will make its way on foot
to this rendezvous point for extract.
How are they gonna pass the Russian lines?
Our intel is spotty at best, but our team is scheduled
to link up with a local agent who will assist.
All right. Let's move this down to the Situation Room.
I'll be there in a few minutes.
  Yes, Sir.   Yes, Sir.
Did he say anything?
He wouldn't even look at me when I said hello.
Send him in.
Doug.
Are you certain?
Who gathered all this inform   Oh, never mind. I shouldn't know.
Was it you... who...?
No.
You shouldn't have brought this here.
I wanted you to see it.
So you would believe me.
Brutal.
I'm drunk, sir.
I'm   I'm drunk right now.
This girl really meant something to you, didn't she?
Yeah.
She did.
I've been working for Dunbar.
I pushed myself too much. It's my fault.
It was for you. To see how close I could get.
If I could find something, a silver bullet.
To prove that... I was still useful.
How can I help you, Doug?
I can't go to rehab.
  Just not another hospital, or...   Okay.
I just... I can't... I can't do it.
We'll figure something out.
I'm not Peter Russo.
I won't go like he did.
No, you won't. You're going to get better, Doug.
I promise you that.
Yes, send Meechum in here.
There's an envelope on my desk. I need it to be incinerated.
Yes, sir.
And then I need you to take Doug home.
Come on, Doug, it's time to go.
This way, Mr. Stamper.
You stay with him until we figure out what's next.
Yes, sir.
Some privacy, please.
  This is Heather Dunbar.   I'll connect you momentarily.
Heather?
Mr. President?
Doug Stamper is my friend,
and you came very close to killing him.
  Excuse me?   You're aware he's an alcoholic?
  Yes.   And how serious his injuries were.
  Mr. President     But you still put him to work.
A man who's trying to recover, who's trying to get back his life.
Did you honestly think that he could handle that?
Douglas came to us.
And you should've turned him away if you had one ounce of decency.
What's happened? Is he okay?
You don't have the right to ask me that question.
And if you do anything that endangers his health again,
I swear to God,
I will put you in your fucking grave.
Let's continue.
Thirty-two thousand feet, one minute to insert.
Let's hear comms.
Audio on.
Stand up!
Twenty seconds. Last checks.
Last checks! Gather round.
Ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four,
three, two. Green light.
  Video will go dark once they jump.   Go. Go.
Chutes deployed.
The rally point.
Link-up with indig agent happens here,
half a klick from the drop zone.
He'll arrange safe passage to the blast site.
Motherfucker!
Agent is rogue. Repeat, we have a bad agent.
  We've been compromised.   Man down! Man down!
  Fuck.   Over there!
  Agent is kilo.   Get pressure on that wound.
We should abort, sir.
  Mr. President.   Shut it down. Bring them home.
"Match Stick," I repeat, "Match Stick."
Head directly to waypoint X-ray. How copy, over?
Proceeding to X-ray.
  Hello?   He's in the bedroom.
Hey, brother.
Say again. Over.
Confirmed, sir.
The element is off the X and moving to extract.
Three wounded, one KIA.
I'll need the name, next of kin.
Yes, sir.
Yes?
Sir, President Petrov is on the line.
I'll take it in here. Shut the door, please.
  Viktor.   We know it was your men.
What was?
Did you think we wouldn't detect you?
Whatever you're accusing us of, I don't know anything about it.
Oh, yes, you do. And so do the Israelis.
We leaked footage of the firefight to them.
I can't imagine they'd be pleased
America is conducting covert operations without consulting with them first.
You killed your own men, Viktor.
It was your man who got shot last night.
I mean the blast. We have the intel.
It was you, not terrorists. It was FSB.
So you humiliate me in Washington, humiliate me in Moscow,
and now you insult me with these ridiculous fantasies.
What do you want out of all of this, Viktor?
Justice, for my soldiers who died on a mission you devised.
If anyone is to blame for their deaths, it's you.
Goodbye, Viktor.
Francis, what did he say?
I have to finish this letter.
Over the last several hours,
Israeli forces entered the Jordan Valley.
Eyewitness reports say
they've taken up positions near the encampments
where Russian troops are refusing access to a blast site
where eight of their countrymen were killed two days ago.
The Israeli Prime Minister had this to say, quote:
"With both Russian forces refusing to leave
and the presence of covert operations from other nations..."
Hamas and Hezbollah are getting involved.
How?
They've vowed to raise local militias if the Israelis cross the border.
...nor has the American government regarding covert operations.
  This is gonna be bad.   Yeah, it sure is.
I should get to the White House.
Lock the door on the way out?
The Israelis.
I know, I've been watching the news all night.
We should get to the Situation Room.
Let me finish this first. I'll be right down.
All right, I'll see you down there.House.of.Cards.SE
And where are you from, Mr. Brown?
Sheldon, sir. I'm a retired police officer.
Well, then I can only imagine that Sheldon must be
one of the safest places in this state.
We do our best.
But my son, he's a marine, stationed at Camp Dwyer.
He keeps our country safer than I do.
Me and my wife were wondering,
if he got sent over to the Jordan Valley,
will that really keep us safer?
Because it sure seems like the whole peacekeeping mission
is only making things more dangerous.
Thank you for that. May I?
Well, first of all, let me say
how grateful I am for your son's service.
I know we all feel exactly the same way.
And now, uh, let me try to answer your question.
Have we run into some difficulties with the Russians?
Yes, we have.
Is there tension between the Israelis and the Palestinians?
Absolutely.
But, that is the very reason that this mission is so important.
We have gathered together a coalition of seven nations
to bring stability to a region
that has suffered from unrest for decades.
It will take time.
And there may be lives that will be lost.
But this is not just important for the Middle East's security,
it's important for the security
of the United States and the rest of the world.
And I hope that I've answered your question.
Now, who was next?
Uh, let's see here.
Well, how about this young woman right here?
Now, I'll give you my microphone,
but only if you promise to give it back.
He seemed to want to hang onto it for a while.
  There you are.   Um, my name is Annie Wietz,
and I'm also worried about what the officer was just saying.
I want a safe world for my grandkids  
Give me back the mic   and I'll answer your question.
No, sir. I haven't asked my question yet.
Apologies. I'm ahead of myself. Go ahead.
The covert operation, the one that caused the Israelis to invade.
Was that us? Because that really seemed
to make a mess of everything.
  May I?   Please.
Thank you. Now, Annie?
  Is that your name, yeah?   Yes, sir.
Now, I have said this on this matter before,
and I know it may be frustrating, but it is the truth.
When it comes to covert operations by any nation,
or matters of intelligence, for security purposes,
including the security of our own soldiers,
I simply cannot comment on these issues.
But, sir, I'm sorry,
but what is the point of having us ask questions
  if you won't answer them?   Well, she's got me there. Uh...
I can answer any question but that one.
In fact, I hope that we can ask some questions about
how we're gonna focus on things right here at home.
How about someone up there in the cheap seats?
Anyone have a question there?
The situation in Jordan Valley,
it threatens to bleed across the border.
We already have refugees requesting to enter Jordan.
Forgive me, Prince Ryad.
You may be dealing with a few hundred refugees,
but we are facing mortar attacks.
Fourteen in the last two weeks.
None of your people have died yet.
The last one came within  meters of a school.
Your troops have killed over a dozen Palestinians in house raids.
You expect us not to fight back?
We need the violence to stop.
If it continues, the peacekeeping mission will fall apart.
And it's our best hope for long-term stability.
Can you speak to Hamas and Hezbollah?
Get them to agree to a cease-fire?
Israel has twice as many troops in the region
as before the peacekeeping mission began.
No, it is we who are defending ourselves.
You agreed to remove two thousand troops.
If there's a cessation of mortar attacks,
and if the Russians leave.
A one-third troop reduction.
That should be enough to convince your people, no?
Once the troops leave, I engage them, but not before.
Show some goodwill. You'll still have , troops there.
Because we cannot accomplish anything
unless we have proof of de-escalation on both sides.
What about Russia?
That's a separate issue. We will tackle that another time.
Can you convey to Jerusalem
the importance of this troop reduction?
Yes, but no promises.
All right. Thank you, everyone.
We'll meet again tomorrow morning.
Thank you, madam.
Eliana.
We need to discuss the no-fly zone.
It's only for the Russians, not the peacekeepers.
They can't stay if they have nothing to eat.
What are you going to do, shoot down a supply plane?
We hope they won't make us face that choice.
They'll ignore it.
And you're just going to antagonize Moscow.
I'm sorry, but the no-fly zone is above my pay grade.
Perhaps your husband can talk to the prime minister.
When are we looking at?
Could be tomorrow, could be a week.
I'm not a part of those conversations anymore.
We could vet the questions.
That doesn't work in Iowa. It'll piss people off.
Even if we did, it wouldn't make a difference.
The country is preoccupied with the Jordan Valley.
We're off message.
In the meantime,
we can put the town halls on hold. Just do the stump.
I think we should also postpone the debate.
Dunbar'll hit you hard for that. Say you're dodging.
Have Jackie request the postponement.
  What's her reason?   I don't care.
Just as long as it isn't coming from us.
Talk to her. Thank you, gentlemen.
What's next?
Uh, you're slated for fundraising calls until :,
then a DOD briefing.
Also, your friend from The Sentinel called, Tim Corbet.
Thank you.
You know, I can fold my own clothes.
Took me two seconds.
You remember when we shared a room my senior year?
And if I left, like, one sock on the floor, you'd freak?
Yeah, I started doing that on purpose, just to see you flip out.
Yeah. I remember.
Come on, leave it. Be a rebel.
Hey, sweetie.
Well, tell her if it wiggles, it means it's gonna fall out.
Okay. Let me talk to her.
Uh, now, listen to me. You  
I know your mom doesn't want you playing with it,
so you have to do what she says.
Well, because the tooth fairy doesn't want fingerprints all over it.
Okay, I'll do it, but you have to promise me
that you and your brother will stop playing with your tooth.
Okay, you ready?
Are you super ready?
Boogala, boogala, boogala, boogala, boogala.
Okay. Put your mom back on.
How much of a postponement?
Until we get this crisis resolved.
Dunbar will see right through that.
Not if it's coming from you.
Say you want to focus on meeting people face to face,
not a televised debate.
We'll back you up.
All right, I'll talk to my staff.
We'll draft some language and I'll run it past you.
Jackie?
I want to talk to you about what happened a couple weeks ago.
  I crossed a line.   Remy, you don't have to.
I want to. I want to explain myself.
I still have strong feelings, I'm not gonna deny that.
Maybe a different job... A different time, different place.
But, uh...
Look...
I've loved people before, and I've learned to let 'em go.
I'm not gonna put you in that position again.
It's been hard for me, too.
You've got work.
I'm glad you said something.
Hello?
Tim, it's Frank.
I'm sorry it took me all day to get back to you.
Ah, no worries. Your plate must be pretty full.
Well, more than I'd like at the moment.
Is this a bad time?
I think I can spare a few minutes
for the President of the United States.
  Are you good?   Yeah.
Good. Uh, last kid got off to college,
so Beth and I are on our own.
Finally. Yeah, the business is strong.
I'm actually, uh, I'm thinking of expanding to Glenwood Canyon.
That's great.
Listen, I called because that,
that writer reached out to me.
You know, the one doing your book.
Said, uh, he wanted to talk about The Sentinel.
What'd you say?
I said I was in a rush and I'd call him back later.
I didn't want to say more without talking to you first.
Well, he should've checked with me beforehand.
I don't want him harassing my friends.
He wasn't harassing me at all. He's a nice guy, actually.
I mean, I'm happy to talk with him if it'll help your book.
Well, the book isn't really about The Sentinel,
so I don't know why he'd bother,
but I'll talk to him and I'll let you know.
Whatever you need, Mr. President.
Stop that.
Hey, listen, uh, we run a half-price special for Commanders-in-Chief.
So, uh... if you're ever in Colorado
with some time on your hands...
Well, I hope the same goes for ex-presidents, too.
Nope. Only sittin' ones. So you better win that damn election.
I'll do my best. Nice talking to you, Tim.
You too, Frank.
I want to set aside time for Tom Yates, in person. Tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
Francis?
I just got off the phone with Cathy.
The Israelis are instituting the no-fly zone.
I'm scheduled to have a call tomorrow with the prime minister.
They want to cancel the call.
Let me see if I can get him on the phone now.
They just sent out a communiqu to all embassies.
Good morning.
As you  
Excuse me. It's been a long night.
Thank you.
Israel instituted a no-fly zone over the Jordan Valley,
And while I disagree with this action,
I understand the reason behind it,
and we must stand with our ally.
Our chief goal remains de-escalation in the region.
Ambassador Underwood and the State Department
are working with all interested parties toward that end.
Our utmost priority is guaranteeing civilian safety.
  And Israel has confirmed  When are you off to Des Moines?
A couple of hours. I have to make some donor calls first.
You have surgery today?
A double bypass. Triple tomorrow.
But nothing scheduled for almost a week after,
so maybe I can come out to Iowa and we can  
  Russian aircrafts that ignore this...   What's going on?
...could potentially be subject to military action...
This Jordan Valley thing's a mess.
He's in big trouble.
...any such actions...
And then there's the whole AmWorks thing.
All the baggage from last year.
  You having doubts?   I don't know.
Maybe.
That sounds serious.
If there was an ideal time to walk away, now is it.
And then what?
Focus on Congress.
Yeah, but you want more than that.
I could spend more time with you and the kids.
Well, I don't want a wife who's miserable
because she turned her back on the White House.
Look...
The thing about surgery is, once you're in, you're in.
There's a beating heart in front of you. Someone's life.
There's no room for doubt.
So, whatever goes wrong...
say hemorrhage or a blood clot, you deal with it.
You don't get to walk away.
But that's life or death. This isn't.
It is for you.
...to maintain international peace and security.
The United States is committed to defusing this situation.
We are here for Israel, we are here for Palestine,
we are here for Russia.
And we are here for  
  Ready to go to your meeting?   Yeah.
Come on.
I was thinking...
you know how a while back,
you mentioned the kids coming out from Ohio?
You want them to visit?
Well, maybe you don't want them to see me like this?
  Doing my  days?   You've been doing great.
I'd be thrilled for them to come out here and meet their uncle,
if that's something you want to do.
I could hit the couch for a few nights.
You guys can have the bedroom.
I'll call Sarah.
I say to Israel, keep your airspace.
Keep your no-fly zone.
I will be flying through it, nevertheless.
Shoot me down, if you wish,
because nothing can stop me
from standing side by side with my countrymen.
I will embrace the men who serve this country,
because I am Russian,
and Russians... do not abandon their own.
Russian TV.
Forty-five minutes ago. It could be hot air.
Petrov wants the world to see this.
He wouldn't put it out there unless he meant it.
Israel says they're prepared to enforce the no-fly zone.
They'll never shoot down a head of state.
Yeah, which means they'll lose face
and compensate by increasing their ground presence.
I got Jerusalem to agree to a pullout.
  Two thousand troops.   Not if Petrov flies there.
If we downplay Petrov's move as political theatrics,
I might be able to convince the Israelis to follow through.
No, we need to respond to Russia directly,
not waste our time with Israel.
Israel is our ally. We're far more likely
to have a productive dialogue with them than with Russia.
Yes. What's our main objective here?
To get Russian troops out of the Jordan Valley.
Let's stop poking around from the sides.
We need to tackle this head on.
Open up a line of communication with Moscow.
Tell them I'm coming to the Jordan Valley myself.
Sir, I  
I'm gonna meet with Petrov face to face, on the ground.
  Mr. President, the risk factors of   I'm well aware.
I want to be notified the moment that Petrov is on his way.
You work with the CIA and DOD
to figure out any logistics and security you have to.
Talk to Seth. Let's start drafting our message.
Cathy, I want to sit down with you and Defense,
and work out bargaining chips.
Thank you all very much.
I meant now.
  I'm not to be disturbed.   You have a meeting with Mr. Yates.
Have him wait and tell him it might be a while.
Yes, sir.
You're on with Ambassador Moryakov.
  Alexi?   You're wasting your time, Claire.
We can't let Petrov go.
I'm powerless.
Then tell me who we can speak to who can influence him.
His mind is made up. No one would dare challenge him on this.
All right, then I'll come to New York. Let's meet with Caspi.
We'll ease Jerusalem's fears together.
I can't. I'm on my way to Washington.
  What for?   The embassy sent for me.
I'm being recalled.
  Is it because...?   I don't know.
Alexi, if you need anything  
The ambassador has ended the call, Mrs. Underwood.
  Mrs. Underwood.   Hello.
  Edward?   Wait here a moment.
Yes, ma'am?
What's he doing here?
The president wanted to meet with him.
He asked me to have him wait upstairs.
  Thank you.   Yes, ma'am.
If he wants the same terms as we had before,
I'll smooth it over with our NATO allies.
It's tough to lose Poland, but I think that we can compensate
with anti-missile subs on patrol here in the Finnish Sea.
Francis? Do you have a moment?
I'll be right back.
Give us a minute.
I think this is a mistake. You're chasing him.
  Let me work with Israel.   You've been working with Israel.
Now there's a no-fly zone. One step forward, two steps back.
Diplomacy takes time.
Iowa is in two months.
You can't let the campaign drive our foreign policy.
If I don't win in Iowa, there is no foreign policy.
Excuse us, Mr. President.
Let's not talk out here.
If you go to the Jordan Valley,
you have to walk away with a solution.
And he knows that, which means he gets all the leverage.
Well, it's not as if we have much leverage at the moment.
He's going to want the peacekeeping mission out.
That's right. And the missile defense system, too.
And I'm prepared to give him both if necessary.
What are you talking about?
Don't toss the mission aside, Francis.
Claire, you're too invested in this.
The mission is dead.
It was dead the moment those troops got blown up.
Your plan failed. I'm sorry.
It's my fault. I approved it.
But now, I have to fix it.
Why won't you place faith in a diplomatic solution?
This is diplomacy.
Sometimes it comes down to two men in a room.
I have no faith in the UN anymore.
I do have faith in my ability to negotiate with this man.
Francis, I know you value my opinion.
Absolutely, above all others.
We have both put a great deal of effort
and thought into how to handle Russia.
I'd like for this to be a decision we make together,
instead of an impulsive response  
  Not right now.   Petrov's in the air.
Get Admiral Dale on the line.
Claire, I value your opinion.
I just don't agree with it this time.
Mr. Yates.
The president's gonna have to reschedule.
Thomas.
You give us a few moments, Edward?
Yes, ma'am. I'll be by the stairs.
How's the book coming?
I've hit a bit of a roadblock.
There's a big piece missing.
  What is it?   You.
He hasn't... mentioned me at all?
Plenty of times, but... it's not enough.
What has he said?
You're putting me in an awkward position, Mrs. Underwood.
You don't want to betray his trust.
He and I have an agreement.
I understand. I shouldn't pry. I'll leave you be, then.
He said he loves you more than anything.
That there wouldn't be a White House without you.
He showed me your first house... in Gaffney.
Where you planted the tulips.
And he said he was ashamed.
Of what?
That you married him. Because you deserve better.
You should really be in this book, Mrs. Underwood.
I've got a lot of stories from his perspective.
Not a single one from yours.
Well, he's the one running for president, not me.
Yeah.
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.
I think people need to hear your voice to hear his.
Can we set up a time to meet?
I'll think about it. Thank you, Thomas.
Okay.
Seth, this is good, but downplay expectations even more.
There's no telling what we'll walk away with.
  Yes, sir.   We shouldn't inform the press
until after you land, for security purposes.
Donald...
  If anything should happen to me   I'm prepared.
  But nothing will.   God help us.
Danton will walk you through the full brief.
Everything's set up in the Situation Room.
  Good luck, Mr. President.   Thank you. I'll be right back.
Now, listen, I know you have reservations about all this.
You're doing what you think is best.
Please be careful out there.
I will.
  I love you.   I love you, too.
Let's go.
Hello?
Hello! Wow! You guys really look alike!
Okay.
We're a hugging family.
I see.
Hi, you must be Francine.
  No, I'm not!   She likes Franke better.
Nice to meet you, Franke.
  No.   Yep.
  I told you!   Careful.
  It's your Uncle Doug.   Hey, who's that?
Do you want to give your Uncle Doug a hug?
Come here, you.
We'll land in Tel Aviv,
then take a special forces convoy
from there to the perimeter of the valley.
The Israelis will provide air support until we get to the valley,
then our helos will take over.
Once we get to the camp,
the Russians insist on ground units only.
We'll pass through a checkpoint  
How secure is this location?
The position is not fortified to our liking.
It's not blast-proof.
Sir, we're going to ask that you wear your Kevlar and helmet.
Sir?
Mary.
Why were no press allowed to go?
Given the security situation,
we didn't want to put any press in harm's way,
or risk any hostile elements knowing in advance.
So the president has already landed?
About  minutes ago.
Mark.
What exactly does the president hope to achieve?
Ideally, we'd like the Russians to vacate the region.
We can't promise that they will.
But the president hopes
that we can make progress toward a withdrawal.
Kate.
This could be seen as an election stunt.
He's trailing Dunbar in the polls, so he wants to save the day.
I guarantee you this is no stunt.
The president is taking extraordinary measures to end this crisis.
Mr. President.
You can take your vest off now, Mr. President.
  We're safe here.   You trust these walls?
If you're frightened, you shouldn't have come.
When I was in the KGB, I spent six months in Afghanistan.
This place is a palace
compared to the hole in the ground I lived in.
Here. You should stay hydrated.
  I brought a shipment of water in on my plane.   Thank you.
So much for the Israelis stopping our resupply.
I wish we were in the fertile part of the valley, though.
I hear it's quite green and beautiful.
Well, this is better for pictures.
How do you mean?
Well, if you flew into a paradise,
wouldn't be as effective, now, would it?
You do have a flair for the theatrical.
I can say the same about you,
showing up on my doorstep like this.
This isn't your doorstep.
You're squatting where you shouldn't be.
I don't think my men will see it like that.
Do your men know that
you're responsible for killing their comrades?
Accusations.
That's how you plan to convince me?
What do you require to pull out of the valley?
That your troops leave as well,
and the entire peacekeeping operation.
Well, as soon as your troops withdraw,
I'll make sure the UN forces do exactly the same.
And you scale back missile defense.
As we agreed to twice already.
That's when we were making an entirely different deal.
The main difference now
is that we're both standing in the desert,
and you can't leave with nothing to show but sand in your shoes.
I'll agree to the scale-back. Same terms as before.
How soon can you mobilize a withdrawal?
Well, the moment UN forces begin to pull out, we will do the same.
I've had the Pentagon
come up with an exit plan that we can put into effect
as early as tomorrow. As for the rest of the UN forces,
I can reach out to the Secretary General immediately.
You or... your wife?
Well, yes, she would probably make the call on my behalf.
I don't think she should.
You think I should make the call?
More than that.
I think she should be gone.
Gone in what way? Gone from these negotiations?
As ambassador.
My final condition.
That cannot be on the table.
It is. And it's non-negotiable.
Ms. Dempsey. I'm a friend of Lisa's.
  Uh, Max?   That's right.
Yes, she told me to tell you she's running a few minutes behind.
Okay, I'll just wait outside. Thank you.
No, it's... chilly.
You can come on up to her room.
Okay.
I just want you to know... I'm so sorry.
Lisa told us and our prayers are with you.
Thank you so much.
She said you and your husband were like parents to her. I see why.
Come on in.
Max, hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Here, I want you to take that back.
No, no, no, that money's yours.
No, I can't. I can't take it.
Everyone at the fellowship pitched in.
  Just give it back to 'em.   I can't.
You said that you needed the money for the medicine.
Yeah, sit down.
Sorry, please.
Okay.
What I'm about to tell you is gonna sound fucked up,
but just hear me out before you say anything, all right?
Okay.
I'm leaving.
And I'm not coming back.
And... I have to leave because I'm in danger.
My name isn't Max.
I don't have AIDS.
  Wait. Hold on.   Let me finish, please.
I want to explain everything to you, but I can't.
The less you know, the better.
But listen to me.
If the FBI comes here, you can't say anything.
You have to tell them you don't know me.
  The FBI?   Yes, and if they do,
I want you to contact this man. His name is Doug Stamper.
  And he can help you.   Max. This is crazy.
It's not my name.
I made it up. I made up everything.
The name, the girlfriend, the clinic.
No, I was there with you.
I faked it. I had to.
If you're not Max... then who are you?
Take this. He will help you.
He can protect you.
Please. I know it's not fair.
  Please leave.   Let me leave this with you.
I don't want to have anything to do with it.
Please, just take it with you.
Please leave.
You're a good person, Lisa.
I'm just not.
And I'm sorry.
What can I offer you instead of her?
Nothing.
What about a humanitarian relief fund,
for your allies in Africa?
You can distribute it any way you see fit.
A few billion dollars? I'm not that easily bought.
All right, let's say that we re-examine our base in Izmir.
Congress would never let you.
And realistically,
you're willing to barter major strategic airfields
on account of your wife?
You can't make this about her.
She was never equipped to be an ambassador.
You know that.
I understand.
How could you say no to your own wife?
But she's blinding you.
  I'm doing you a favor.   You are being petty.
The SEAL team you sent.
Look how easily we manipulated her.
Moryakov didn't have to work too hard.
Did we blow up our own men?
Maybe we did.
Maybe we didn't.
But we made her believe that we did.
And she convinced you.
Now, wouldn't you call that blindness?
You want to kill me now. I can see it.
I read an amusing article about, um...
a Civil War re-enactor,
who said that your great-great-grandfather
killed a Yankee soldier with his bare hands.
When I was in Afghanistan, we were ambushed by the Mujahideen.
And the man who shot me here and here,
he stabbed me when his rifle jammed.
I pulled the knife away and slit his throat.
Yes, I know, you've told that story dozens of times to the press.
The part I don't tell is
that after I slit his throat, I kept going.
We strapped his head to a donkey
so it would carry it back to his village.
I've killed a man with my bare hands.
It wasn't make-believe.
Do you think you're capable?
I think you are.
You're ruthless.
Like me.
Sometimes we must be ruthless with those who hate us.
And sometimes we must be ruthless with those we love.
I don't see why Claire means so much to you.
Because she means so much to you.
And if you do this, I will know you're serious.
Your wife is on the line, sir.
Tell her I'll call her back.
I've told her that twice now.
  Tell her again.   Yes, sir.
You don't have to do that, Sarah.
I don't mind. It doesn't take long.
No, no. Let us do it. You go relax.
I'll move the monsters in a few minutes.
  Okay.   All right.
See you in bed.
See you tomorrow.
I wish I could sleep like that.
You ever think of settling down?
Gettin' a couple of these for yourself?
Hasn't ever crossed my mind.
Never?
It's not for me. A life like that.
You mean a life like mine?
  That's not what I said.   I know you've always felt that way.
A mortgage, nine to five, wife, two kids, a dog.
No.
It's just my freedom's important to me.
I'm freer than you are, pal.
I stayed in Columbus because I liked it,
not because anybody made me.
I chose to put down roots.
You've always been running from something.
Hey, I don't judge you. Don't judge me.
Listen to your big brother for a second.
No, last thing I need is a lecture right now.
During your whole recovery,
all you kept talking about was getting back to work.
Over a month I've been here,
using all my vacation time and then some.
If you don't want to be here, then maybe you should go home.
It's not about that, Doug.
I'm here because you're family.
Because you're more important than work.
If I lost my job because of you, I'd find another one.
What do you have?
Frank Underwood? You don't even have that.
You got two pictures on your fridge,
and they're of my kids.
That's not freedom.
Petrov wants a diplomatic change.
At the UN.
  Me.   It was non-negotiable.
Clearly, you didn't say no.
I wanted to discuss it with you first.
I called more than once.
I wanted to convince myself to refuse what he asked.
But... I couldn't do that.
I told you it was a mistake to go, Francis.
And the resolution was a mistake. And Corrigan was a mistake.
We could tally up all our mistakes, but we are where we are.
I need to concentrate on what's in front of me right now.
I am. I'm in front of you.
The Russians need to leave. It's as simple as that.
You want me to say this is okay.
No.
Francis, I would've preferred
if you had walked in and just told me I was fired.
They played you, Claire.
Moryakov was not having some crisis of conscience.
It was all so that we would send our SEAL team in.
So that we would provoke the Israelis.
And I didn't see it, because I trusted you too much.
I didn't look at it objectively...
because you're my wife.
  Petrov told you that?   Yes.
  And you believe him?   I do.
I'll resign.
I wish it didn't have to come to this.
What do we say to the press?
That you want to focus on the campaign,
that that was your plan all along.
That I want to see this crisis through, first.
No one will question that.
Tell Petrov.
And I will...
make the announcement whenever you want me to.
Claire.
You were right. I shouldn't have gone.
It was your decision to make. Not mine.
Good night.
My decision.
Sometimes I think the presidency...
is the illusion of choice.
What is it?
I have to go to the White House.
It's the middle of the night.
He's the president.
Thank you, Meechum.
Have a seat.
I wake you up?
It's fine.
I'm a light sleeper anyway.
If it wasn't you, it would've been a siren or a dump truck.
I get woken up in the middle of the night all the time.
Some crisis somewhere in the world.
Some... situation...
in the Situation Room.
Well, that's better than a dump truck.
You reached out to Tim Corbet.
I did.
I spoke to him a few days ago.
He called to let me know.
So you two are still close.
Not anymore.
At school we were.
I thought he might have some insight to how you were back then.
Those are formative years.
More formative for you than for me.
I learned how to march and shoot a gun, that's about it.
I would've been better off in military school.
Yeah? Why's that?
You go from turning tricks to being on the bestseller list
before you can legally drink, it messes with you.
You told me your friend was the one who, uh...
I lied.
Why? You ashamed?
First time I did it, I was scared out of my mind.
I knock on the door, it opens...
guy's in a satin robe.
He's fat.
Stringy hair, combed over his bald spot.
Beads of sweat rolling down his cheeks.
I almost ran back to the elevator.
But you didn't.
No.
I needed the money.
Before I got undressed...
he tells me that his wife just died.
Car accident.
Says they had plans to visit Tokyo in the spring.
Tells me about his three kids.
The one that was born with a cleft palate.
Describes his house in Westchester,
with a Juliet balcony in the living room.
Says how beautiful she was.
Tells me he doesn't want to die.
Never touched me once.
Sometimes it was just sex.
But a lot of times, it wasn't.
They would tell me everything.
These men.
That access.
Those stories.
It was an addiction.
I craved it.
I lived for it.
And then you wrote about it.
When I got famous...
I had to stop.
I tried it once, I got recognized.
I wasn't invisible anymore.
I couldn't escape myself.
I wish I could do that sometimes.
Escape myself.
Is it Claire?
You didn't ask me here to talk about Tim Corbet.
What's in this for you?
I'm addicted.
To me?
I betrayed her.
How?
I'm not asking as your biographer.
I'm asking as your friend.
Are we friends?
We could pretend to be.
This isn't pretend.
I'm real.
You're hurting.
She's hurting more.
Everyone's hurting.
Go home.
You should get some sleep.
And so should I.
Thirty years is a long time.
You've made it this far.
Okay!
Double!
Jesus.
I didn't hear you come back.
I didn't want to wake you.
  What is it?   Mid-East bureau.
They say the Russians are pulling out their troops.
Whatever he did out there must have worked.
I wonder what it cost him.
We ran the different looks by a couple of focus groups.
These are the three favorites.
Not this one.
Uh, this one. What do you think?
I like it.
  The hair color as well?   Do you mind going back to blonde?
I'd prefer it dark.
The groups, in Iowa, in particular, they like the blonde.
Fine. We'll go blonde then.
You're popular among women.
We want to push those numbers as high as we can,
and every little bit counts.
You don't have to explain. We'll do the color change
after we announce the resignation.
Thanks, Abbie.
If you don't want to, you don't have to do this.
It's fine.
The nomination is not gonna hinge on your hair.
You heard what Abbie said. Every little bit counts.
We'll do what we have to.House.of.Cards.SE
Over  years?
Thirty?
  How about fifty?   Fifty-five.
Fifty-five years.
And what is your name, ma'am?
  Agnes.   Yeah, I think you mean Saint Agnes.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Well, Francis and I are only halfway there,
but I bet you know your husband as well as you know yourself.
  Am I right?   Yes, I do.
Well, I know Francis Underwood.
I know what keeps him up at night.
And I'm sure it's the same thing that keeps your husbands up, too.
The future. How can I ensure a better future for my family?
Except... Francis, as President...
his focus is on the progress of all American families.
You know what he said to me last night?
He said, "Claire, my entire presidential agenda, it's very simple.
I want to be able to look every single American in the eye,
and know that I have made their lives better."
Yes.
I have to say, Mrs. Underwood,
I find you very charming.
And you seem quite honest.
But I have trouble believing
that your husband truly cares about people.
Well, Francis Underwood is a good man.
He's dedicated and generous.
And I have  years of proof.
And I can honestly say, even if I wasn't married to him,
he would definitely have my vote.
Thank you.
Negligence. Nepotism.
Misappropriation of federal funds.
A foreign policy fiasco and loose with the truth.
What do these five fingers have in common?
Francis J. Underwood.
Mr. King, I would like to respond to that.
This is a man who believes in the rule of law-ish.
The legislative process-ish. The Constitution-ish.
Is this the man who should be president?
Ms. Dunbar, like any good lawyer,
you have a knack for rhetoric-ish.
But the American people are tired of words.
What they crave is action.
My concern about focusing on the word, "action,"
is that she'll just come back with failed actions.
America Works, the UN mission.
"Action" performed well with key demos in our last poll.
Yes, but doesn't this take us off message?
We have been saying, "A vote for Frank Underwood
is a vote for America Works."
That's what we've been running on.
You need a word that goes beyond America Works.
Something that can be used for anything.
Remy, what do you think?
We're talking about the word, "action."
Sorry, I was, uh...
my mind was on the foreign policy argument.
  I was just thinking ahead.   What about "vision"?
Isn't that too generic?
That's what we want. I mean, the more generic, the better.
People can project anything they want on "vision."
I'll get it polled before tomorrow.
We should work on Sharp next.
You want me to play her?
Thank you for taking your role so seriously, Donald.
You should consider a career on the stage.
Because he sure as hell isn't gonna be on my ticket.
You're good at this. They loved you.
Three decades of campaigns, you learn how to read an audience.
Self-promotion gives me hives.
Honestly, I don't know how you do it.
I'm promoting my husband, not myself.
That's a convenient way to spin it, don't you think?
Are you always this blunt?
I only have two days to tag along.
Mind if I ride with you, since we have so little time?
I need to make some calls. Maybe we'll find some time later.
Remy, you were distracted earlier. What's going on?
Nothing. Everything's good.
I need you on your A-game, Remy.
This debate could make us the front-runner.
It's just between the campaign and managing the White House,
I'm a little burnt out.
We still have months to go. A year before the general.
It's temporary. I'll get past it.
If you can do it, I can.
Gavin?
  Hello, Douglas.   What do you want?
You still can't believe she's dead, can you?
Well, you shouldn't. 'Cause she's not.
She's alive, and I know exactly where she is.
I've known for a while.
  What?   Look on your laptop.
No, you... you showed me the picture.
  Of her body.   That wasn't her.
I forged it all so you'd lift my passport lock.
Well, I'm out now, Doug.
And I'm safe. But my friend isn't.
Talk to Green.
Get him the same deal you got me, all charges dropped.
You do that, and I'll tell you where she is.
  Hey, Meechum.   Sir.
Mr. President.
Thank you for coming all the way to Andrews.
Did Remy walk you through the broad strokes?
No matter the policy question, foreign or domestic,
we hammer Dunbar's lack of experience.
We bludgeon it.
We cannot say "lack of experience" enough.
And no doubt, she'll bring up Claire's recess appointment,
where I can't take the bait, so I leave that entirely to you.
This was one of the things that I was hoping to discuss.
Oh, you don't want to call her "sexist"?
  The argument doesn't hold.   It does hold.
She says that Claire was unqualified.
You say she wouldn't say that about a man with the same CV.
I'm not sure that's true.
And calling another woman sexist
when there's a man on the stage  
And who else is better but you
to call her out on what she's done for women,
which is absolutely nothing?
Whereas gender-equality legislation is one of your hallmarks.
But it could hurt me more than it hurts her.
I thought we had an understanding.
You were gonna play pit bull while I play presidential.
Will you get a little bloody? Yes, probably.
But that's what people want in their debates.
And then you and I together, we bury her.
You drop out next week, endorse me
and the race is over.
I have no problem being forceful.
But this sexism thing, and the whole school argument, I  
You mean her kids.
I really don't want to involve them.

she lacks experience
and she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.
But there has to be another way.
She wants to trumpet an equal playing field?
Then why does she send her own kids to private school?
That is a clear and simple argument
that everyone can get their heads around.
And it doesn't hurt
that Iowa's biggest employer is the public school system.
Alan sends his kids to private school.
Yeah, but they're not your kids.
They're my step-kids. And that makes me a hypocrite.
Is that really what you're concerned about?
Being a hypocrite?
It's my family.
Oh, trust me, they'll understand
the moment they step into the White House.
Jackie, I really shouldn't have to convince you
to do what it takes to get a set of keys.
I'll be the pit bull, Mr. President.
Thank you, Jackie.
  Are we all clear?   The press has boarded, sir.
  All right, make sure no one sees her.   Yes, sir.
Flight time to Des Moines today will be two hours...
Such a pity how much ruthless pragmatism
gets weighed down by family values.
Without her doctor and his pimply-faced brood,
she could soar as high as this plane.
Oh, I know, the marriage was my idea. Don't remind me.
Doug.
  You okay?   Yeah. I'm all right.
What, did you get locked out or something?
I felt the need to drink.
I got this far and I stopped myself.
Okay.
I wanted you to see it.
That I could control it.
You wanna go back up?
Yeah.
I know it looks crazy.
But I had to do it.
Why?
There was this girl... before the injury.
She left me. So I started drinking.
I tried to shut her out,
but I just kept checking my e-mails, my text messages.
It needed to stop.
Who was she?
You know what? That's okay.
Doesn't matter.
What matters is that you got pushed to the edge today
and you didn't fall off.
You did what you had to do.
I don't judge you for it.
And I don't think it's crazy.
We could've met somewhere a little warmer.
Walmart wanted to knock this down, build a store here.
  But the community put a stop to it.   I know.
Because they wouldn't give a tax credit
unless entry-level wages were higher.
So which is better? A shitty job, or no job?
  Well, I think I know your answer.   Don't be so sure.
Jackie, you have repeatedly
opposed the minimum-wage and CEO salary bill
I asked the leadership to introduce.
I've put a lot of thought into it.
This community took a stand.
If enough of them do, Congress won't have a choice but to act.
Are we here to talk about legislation?
Because we both have a debate in six hours.
I want to endorse you.
I'll lay off you tonight. You and I attack Underwood.
In three days, I'll drop out and endorse.
We haven't even had the first caucus.
You two are neck-and-neck.
I have  points in Iowa, twelve in New Hampshire.
You get my people, you have a clear win in both states.
My endorsement is valuable.
How much does Underwood value it?
  Highly.   What did he offer you?
I'm more interested in what you have to offer.
Did he promise a cabinet position?
More than that?
He offered to put you on the ticket, didn't he?
I wouldn't expect to be on your ticket, Heather.
You need a Southerner with a penis.
I was thinking Secretary of Defense, given my war record.
But I'd be open to other ideas.
I would love your support, Jackie, but I offer you nothing.
But... this is an easy win.
I'm not gonna start selling off cabinet positions
before I've won the White House.
Those decisions will be based purely on merit.
If I'm gonna lock up this nomination for you,
I deserve to be compensated.
I plan on winning, Jackie. Just... not your way.
And with or without your support.
Then I'm sticking with Underwood.
You do what you have to do.
Is Jackie in here?
Hi, Bob.
Sorry I'm late.
  How did your surgery go?   Terrible.
The patient almost didn't make it.
But he's alive?
She. And yeah. Stable condition.
It means so much to me that you came.
All done.
  Do you like?   It's good. Thank you.
  So, how'd it go with  ?   Thanks.
What'd she offer?
Nothing.
  Nothing at all?   I know, I was surprised, too.
It's foolish. She could lock this up.
I have to say, I almost... respect it.
Anyway, you were right.
Stick with the devil you know.
Are the kids watching tonight?
Yeah. They've got all their friends over at the house.
Listen, the ki  
What?
Nothing. How do I look?
I'd throw you on that bed right now
if it wouldn't mess up your hair.
Watch me prep.
You can mess up my hair all you want after the debate.
  She's here.   There she is.
Quiet, guys. Quiet, guys. Here she comes.
Quiet, quiet!
Thank you. Thank you. Hello, everyone!
Thank all of you so very much
for working so hard to make sure we take New Hampshire.
It is field offices like this that win primaries,
and the president wants you to know
how much your dedication means to us.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Now, who's ready to watch a debate?
There is a large crowd here in Sioux City tonight.
I would say potential voters, but of course, here in Iowa,
citizens caucus instead of vote,
and many of the people here in this room
will be doing just that on January th.
A CNN ORC poll has it
as a tight race between the two front-runners.
Heather Dunbar at  percent.
President Frank Underwood at  percent.
Congresswoman Jackie Sharp trails in third at  percent.
Twenty-two percent remain undecided.
You can switch it.
Really?
Unless you want to watch.
No, I thought you would.
It's your last night here.
I want to spend it with my brother,
not Frank Underwood.
What do you want to watch instead?
Anything. Whatever you want.
...promising universal employment,
and on Israeli Palestinian relations...
Oh, shit. Have you ever seen Contagion?
No.
If you're a clean freak,
this'll definitely make you a germ freak.
  I love this movie.   Go for it.
Welcome to the first
Democratic nomination debate hosted by CNN.
Frank Underwood,
Jackie Sharp, and Heather Dunbar.
I'm John King and I'll be your moderator tonight.
Our debate will be divided in two parts,
the first part focusing on foreign policy,
part two focusing on the domestic agenda.

I will ask one candidate a question.
That candidate will have one minute to answer.
After that, all of our candidates can engage in an open conversation
lasting for five minutes.
We begin, though, with opening statements.
And by lottery, it was decided
that President Underwood goes first.
  Mr. President.   Thank you. And good evening, John,
good evening to my fellow candidates,
and to the good people of Sioux City.
vision.
I believe that I have shown a clear vision to this country
with America Works,
the most comprehensive jobs program in nearly a century.
We showed it could work in Washington DC.
We need now to take what we did there and spread it nationwide,
so that the American dream can become the American reality.
But that vision isn't enough on its own.
You need someone with experience to make it happen.
And between my time in Congress and now at the White House,
I have more experience than both of my opponents combined.
And, uh, when you hire someone for a job,
are you gonna hire someone with  years' experience,
or someone with less than ten
or someone with no experience at all?
Where I come from down south,
we call that as clear as a glass of moonshine.
Former Solicitor General Dunbar is next.
  Your opening statement, please.   Thank you, John.
And thank you Iowa.
Well, I agree with the President.
Vision and experience are exactly what America needs.
Unfortunately,
he has the wrong vision and horrendous experience.
You can call America Works visionary, but in truth,
it is just an ultra-conservative agenda
that's been around for decades.
Dismantle the safety net and hang people out to dry.
As for the President's experience,
he was in the leadership during
one of the most ineffective decades in Congressional history.
As president, he has failed at everything he's done.
America Works was illegal in the minds
of many legal experts, myself included.
His Jordan Valley plan was a disaster.
If that's what you call experience,
you're not just padding the rsum, you are fabricating it.
President Underwood isn't presenting us with a vision,
he is convincing himself of his own delusion.
Now, my vision is to tackle corporate greed,
raise pay for those who need it most,
and create jobs by growing the economy,
not robbing people of their retirement and health care.
My experience is  years defending the Constitution.
You know when I take my presidential oath,
I will mean every word of it.
Ms. Dunbar, thank you. Congresswoman Sharp,
  your opening statement, please.   Thank you.
As many of you know, I am a US Army veteran.
Now, I've seen firsthand the great sacrifices
my fellow servicemen and women have made defending this country.
But how can we ask them to protect a system
that isn't protecting us?
Take women, for example.
There are two women at this debate running for president.
That's extraordinary. But out in the general workforce?
Women earn  cents on the dollar compared to men.
Even worse is minority women earning  cents on the dollar.
Now, Ms. Dunbar can talk about balancing the scales,
but she inherited a multi-billion-dollar fortune
and never had to earn any cents on the dollar.
Now, I don't agree with everything
that President Underwood has done or proposes,
but at least he knows what it means to work for a living.
I can give you even better than that.
I know what it means to fight for a living.
And I will fight for fairness here at home
just as fiercely as I fought our enemies overseas.
Thank you.
Thank you, Congresswoman.
Let's move to part one: foreign policy.
And the first question is for you, Mr. President.
Given the recent volatile events in the Jordan Valley,
do you still believe it was correct
to assemble the United Nations coalition and to intervene,
or is it time now to call that intervention a mistake?
Well, I will answer that question, John,
but I'd like to address first
something Ms. Dunbar said a few moments ago.
America Works is not some stale, old, conservative agenda.
You name me one Republican
who has suggested using federal funds
to guarantee jobs for every American
who wants one and I will eat my hat.
This isn't about dismantling government. It is about  
Aren't we supposed to be talking about foreign policy?
Yeah, I will. But first,
  I'd like to correct...   because it's easier to talk about
America Works
than to defend your indefensible UN mission.
At least I have a record to defend, Ms. Dunbar.
Speaking of your record, Mr. President,
you went on record saying you wouldn't run for president.
  And yet here you are.   John, it seems that
your very thoughtful rules have gone out the window.
You have no respect for rules, Mr. President.
Take FEMA, for example.
Oh, you want to talk about FEMA now
instead of foreign policy.
I am just following your lead, sir.
See what a mess we get into
when we follow your brand of leadership?
Well, I must admit that Ms. Dunbar
does have many years of experience
making rhetorical arguments in court.
You've just seen proof of that today.
But serving the American people is not about what you say,
it's about what you do.
what have you ever done?
I have to agree that Ms. Dunbar's lack of experience is a concern.
I find it ironic that the president talks about
the importance of experience,
given the fact that he appointed his wife UN ambassador
despite her utter lack of credentials.
That's a sexist comment.
Excuse me?
You wouldn't be making that argument
if a female president had appointed her husband.
A husband with the same lack of international affairs experience
as Claire Underwood? Yes, I would.
In fact, it makes me question your advocacy for women in general.
Well, that's ridiculous.
What have you done to further gender equality?
What have you done to balance the scales?
That's your slogan, and yet
you've left half of the population out of the mix.
But that is simply not true.
Can, can you name one specific thing?
Yes, I can. Being a woman, who has served as Solicitor General,
one of the few in the history of the court.
Well, that advanced your interests,
but what did that do for  million women out there?
The very fact that a woman can hold that position  
  So you are a symbol.   In a way, yes, I suppose I am.
Me and many other women, including yourself  
Okay, but how does that get us
from  cents on the dollar to ?
Real cents. Not symbolic cents.
Well, now you're just aping the president's rhetoric.
Another sexist comment.
  How could you possibly misconstrue my words?   I speak for myself.
I am not aping the president or any other man.
I'm sorry, I won't engage with this  
You know, when things get tough on the battlefield,
we never say,
"Sorry, I won't engage."
We engage, Ms. Dunbar.
And you need to confront the fact
that you do not have women's best interests at heart.
John, this is getting out of hand.
All right, then let's move on to the next question.
We are in the foreign policy portion of this debate.
Ms. Dunbar, let me bring this question to you.
You're critical of the president.
You say it's indefensible, what he has done in the Jordan Valley.
  That's right.   But specifically, what would you do differently?
Well, John, I'm glad you asked that.
Sending troops into the
  Jordan Valley isn't what I call diplomacy.   I need to go back to the hotel.
Everybody, Mrs. Underwood needs to leave us now.
I really wish I could stay,
but I have a very full day tomorrow.
I should rest up. But again, I want to thank you all
for your hospitality and all of your hard work.
Thank you so much.
Good night, everyone.
His trickle-down diplomacy is another example of delusion.
Mrs. Underwood.
Oh, you should go back inside with the volunteers
and have the full campaign experience.
I didn't come to New Hampshire for that.
I came to speak with you.
Tomorrow, maybe. My brain is a bit fried.
Is it what Sharp said?
Why you don't want to watch anymore?
  The sexist comment?   Oh, I honestly don't care.
It's all spectacle.
Who can get the most points, right?
Good night.
the domestic agenda.
And the first question goes to you, Congresswoman.
The President speaks of America Works.
Ms. Dunbar wants to raise minimum wage.
Talks about regulating executive pay.
But a lot of people aren't quite clear
about your economic policy.
What specifically, I underscore "Specifically,"
would you do if elected president?
Well, I plan to do a lot. And we talked about this earlier.
First and foremost,
I want to press for gender equality
and close the salary gap.
If half of the working population
has more money in their pockets,
that will catalyze spending, which will grow the economy,
which will, in turn, create more jobs.
Mr. President, what do you think of that?
Oh, I agree. I think that gender equality is very important.
And under my AmWorks program,
there will be a provision that all AmWorks jobs,
there can be no discrepancy in pay between men and women.
AmWorks jobs, so that's the government.
What about the rest of the private sector?
Well, I think we have to start by leading by example,
then we introduce legislation...
Leading by example?
If America Works is how you lead by example...
I'm sorry, please let me finish my point, Mr. Dunbar.
If that is how you lead by example,
then are we to assume that everyone should illegally
raid funds that they have no right to use?
Everyone should start robbing banks?
Holding up liquor stores?
Now, Ms. Dunbar, with all due respect,
you can criticize my programs as much as you want,
but to accuse me of illegal activity  
One thing you can't deny is that I am much more of an authority
on the Constitution than you are, Mr. President.
Ms. Dunbar, all three of us on this stage
have taken oaths of office.
I would have to say that we have all defended the Constitution.
You don't have some special claim on the Constitution.
The Constitution belongs to everyone in this room
and every citizen in the United States.
But I would ask Ms. Sharp,
you voted in favor of dismantling America Works.
Was that because you thought it was in fact,
as Ms. Dunbar says, illegal?
I voted for dismantlement because I wanted to make sure
we were prepared for the hurricane,
not because I thought your
reading of the Stafford Act was illegal per se.
Honestly, you think the president had a right to do what he did?
It's an appropriations issue, not a legal one.
What about his character?
He basically walked into FEMA and said,
"Stick 'em up and show me where the vault is."
So now I'm a bank robber. Six Gun Underwood,
what they call me in South Carolina.
I'm sorry, but I do not find this funny.
I say you are a hypocrite.
You claim to care about the ten million people out of work,
but you will steal their Disaster Relief Fund...
This is an appropriations issue, Miss Dunbar.
  Social Security and health care.   I'd like to talk about hypocrisy.
We put , people to work in Washington DC.
Heather Dunbar wants to balance the scales
to fix a broken system.
And yet she sends her own kids to private school.
With money she never earned, but which she inherited.
Now, it is easy to talk about the problems of the poor
with a silver spoon in your mouth.
Am I well-off? Absolutely.
So was FDR when he developed the New Deal.
Since when does one's income determine one's amount of empathy?
Would you send your kids to public school?
Let's keep our children out of this.
You want your kids to have a head start,
to have an advantage over the kids in public schools.
Lots of Americans, of all ranges of income,
choose to send their children to private or parochial schools.
But isn't it true that you want your children
to have a leg up on everyone else?
Is that balancing the scales? Or is that hypocrisy?
Or maybe it's that you didn't want to raise them yourself
so you sent them to boarding school.
You must really want to be president.
I would never in a million years
bring up your children in a debate.
The way you choose to raise them is your business.
Do I want the best for my kids? Yes, I do.
I imagine you're the same way.
I hope you are.
Well, I'm sure you're both excellent mothers.
But perhaps we should get back to
  some of the issues at hand.   Congresswoman Sharp
raised the issue of sexism earlier.
Now, it is an important point, and we need to address it.
Sexism is wrong. The Congresswoman is correct
in saying that all aspects of it should be illegal.
And then, she accused me of being sexist
for criticizing Claire Underwood.
But wouldn't that same logic hold true for you, Ms. Sharp?
Would you have come after my kids if I were a man?
Aren't you trying to paint the picture that I'm a bad mother,
shipping my kids off to some far-flung place?
Because you know if you can make me seem like a bad mother,
then how could anyone possibly support me?
That's not hardball, that is just disgusting.
Well, I have to say I do think Ms. Dunbar has a point.
I mean, speaking of hypocrisy,
don't you send your own kids to private school,
Congresswoman?
Well, that wasn't my point. I  
What was your point?
Well, I was, um...
My... My point....
John, I think I've said all I need to say on this subject.
All right, fair enough, Congresswoman.
Next question goes to you, Ms. Dunbar.
Okay, guys, first poll is coming in.
Most of them give Frank Underwood the win.
Not by a lot.
But did he do enough to overtake Dunbar, become the front-runner?
George, I don't think it's so much what Underwood did,
but what he didn't do.
He remained presidential.
And when the attacks came his way, he held the high ground.
Now, Dunbar and Sharp, they came out swinging,
and I think it hurt them both.
Yeah, but Sharp had to do something.
She's  points behind the other two.
But the sexism thing? And going after Dunbar's kids?
It seemed quite desperate.
She did do some damage to Dunbar.
I don't know about that. Dunbar could've fared far worse.
She took it on the chin, held her own,
and in my opinion, it was a tie.
But bottom line, does this debate change anything?
Does it affect the caucus,
Does it affect the primary in New Hampshire?
We're still over a month out.
And so a lot could change in this process,
but I do think the momentum could shift in Underwood's favor.
Let's not forget that it's remarkable that a sitting president
isn't considered the front-runner to begin with.
That's an excellent point.
No incumbent has ever had to fight back from this far...
  Yes?   He said she's not picking up, sir.
Would you like me to have him knock on her door?
No, that's all right. Thank you.
You haven't said a word.
Well, you've been prepping for days.
I thought you might want a break from talking.
You're disappointed in me.
That the kids got mentioned.
They're teenagers. They'll be fine.
Probably thrilled... that they got mentioned at all.
If I'm disappointed in anyone,
it's him, for throwing you under the bus.
I gotta fly back with you tonight.
Don't you have events tomorrow?
This is more important.
What is?
Thank you all for coming in.
If you want to head out this door right here.
Thank you very much.
All right, I'll give you some privacy.
This should only take  minutes.
  So just holler out if you need anything.   Thank you.
Pull up a chair. We can talk while this finishes up.
I should be doing this, too.
I'm sure we could get another lawn chair in here.
I can't. I was a junkie once upon a time.
What would you call this color? Scarlet isn't right.
It's not crimson or maroon.
  Carmine.   Carmine?
You must be a writer.
No, I know that. But you know she always tells everyone
she bakes them herself and I know she doesn't.
That's local.
Thank you for your support. I'll see you when I get there.
Is there some reason we couldn't do this by phone?
This needed to be in person.
Yes, but you canceled all your events.
I want to talk about the debate.
You know, it wasn't the home run we hoped for,
but you did great, Jackie.
She spent half the debate on the defensive.
I humiliated myself.
You got a little beat up, that's all.
And you threw the biggest punch.
Oh, you mean the thing about your kids?
That wasn't what we discussed.
I had to hit you hard so she wouldn't.
And besides, we had to dispel any suspicion
that you and I might be in concert.
I'm not comfortable with the dynamic we've established.
What dynamic is that?
The leash you have me on.
How I'm supposed to roll over and do any trick you want.
You're taking me for granted.
What, am I supposed to be, uh...
appreciative of your lackluster enthusiasm?
How fortunate I am to have you "sort of" on my team?
You're not "happy" with our dynamic?
Well, I'm not happy with your attitude.
If anything, you're taking me for granted.
  Sir     We had a deal, Jackie.
And I am perfectly willing to hold up my end of the bargain.
But do not be under any illusions.
This is not a partnership of equals.
Nothing close to it.
If you are to be my Vice President, you will do what I ask.
And we will not
have this conversation every time you feel uncomfortable
with what I ask you to do,
or how I choose to conduct myself.
That's our dynamic.
Are we still sticking to the timeline?
I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you.
Are we still sticking to the timeline? I drop out next week?
I see no reason why you shouldn't.
  Thank you, Mr. President.   See you in Iowa.
Why did you change your hair back to blonde?
That's your burning question?
I'm curious.
How does that help the book?
Who knows? But right now, I got nothing.
We changed it because blonde polls better with the voters.
We?
There's a whole gaggle of people
that weigh in on how you look, and what you wear,
whether an event calls for...
heels, earrings, no earrings.
You hate it, don't you?
Campaigning?
Everybody hates campaigning.
Except for the politicians. They feed off the energy.
And their spouses.
You think Francis feeds off me?
You are literally giving your blood.
Plenty of people give blood who aren't married to politicians.
Very few people campaign for someone who just fired them.
He tell you that?
He said he betrayed you.
Three days later, you change your hair back to blonde
and resign so you can, quote, "devote yourself to the campaign."
I did the math.
You and Francis, you've....
We've what?
He's shared a lot.
Does that bother you?
Why would it?
Another betrayal?
No.
You're...
Are you okay?
Just a little light-headed.
  Here.   Thank you.
I was thinking.
About what?
Mrs. Underwood?
Jumping.
Jumping?
You ever have that feeling?
  Conversation?   Which feeling?
On a bridge, you look over and...
step back.
Do you need me to get someone?
He proposed and I said...
I said seven years.
If it's still good, another seven.
If not...
Every seven years.
I don't hate campaigning.
What I hate is...
how much I need us.
How much you need each other?
I didn't jump.
I didn't step back.
I didn't...
Mrs. Underwood?
  What happened?   She passed out.
Let me see. Mrs. Underwood?
Can you hear me? Mrs. Underwood?
So all these three girls, they got a different papi or what?
They got the blonde, they got the redhead, they got the brunette.
  And that's Petticoat Junction, right?   Sir?
  May we speak privately?   Oh, let me let y'all be.
No, Freddie. You're in the middle of your story.
Sir, if you don't mind.
  Is it classified?   No, it is not.
Then talk.
Jackie just stopped by my office. She's upset.
I think we need to take her views more into consideration.
She's being ridiculous.
I think she made some valid points.
Who do you work for, me or her?
I'm just trying to communicate her concerns.
She'd better get in line and so had you.
I'm never gonna win if I have to spend my time
explaining myself to my subordinates.
  Look, let me let you     No, no. Now, Freddy, sit down.
Do you remember when we talked about how you treat your staff?
You want to win?
You sure as hell won't do it without any of them.
You keep on like this, you won't have any of them left.
Are you talking about loyalty?
The only brand of that I accept is unconditional.
  Anything less is a     Y'all should put this on pay-per-view.
But you. You a big guy. But this sucker,
I've seen him go through a rack of ribs like it was wet tissue.
Who'd you put your money on?
Oh, I'm not gonna fall into that trap.
  You.   Sir? It's your wife.
  She passed out giving blood.   What?
She's okay, but, uh, Mr. Yates is on the line.
I'll take it in my private study.
Don't do no good callin' a man out like that.
It's like... blamin' a snake for having fangs.
I couldn't help myself.
  Could you do me a favor?   What's that?
Cover for me. I got work to do and he needs company.
Back at the ribs joint, I could just walk back in the kitchen
when I got tired of hearing him talk.
  Yeah. I'll tell him your boss came over.   Thank you, brother.
Put her on the phone with me.
She didn't want me to call, but I thought I should.
  Well, is she nearby?   I think she's embarrassed.
I'm her husband.
The nurses are with her.
Maybe you should just hold off for a few minutes.
Tell the head of her detail to get her on the plane right away.
She has to come back here and see the White House physician.
My guess is she'd be even more embarrassed
if she had to cancel her events.
This isn't about how she feels.
This is about what's best for her.
She doesn't need a doctor. She needs you.
What do you mean?
She said some things, about every seven years.
About being in limbo, on the edge of a bridge.
Listen, just because I may have shared with you
a few things about our marriage
does not give you the right to interfere with it.
Now, please have her call me when she's ready.
Well... this is it.
  Sixty days.   Sixty days.
That movie freaked me out.
The whole world can fall apart in sixty days.
Or a guy can get sober.
I washed my hands for ten minutes last night before bed.
You turned me from an alcoholic to a germaphobe.
That's not a bad trade-off.
The  years I got by on my own...
they mean nothing compared to the last eight weeks
you've been here with me.
You would have done the same for me.
I'd like to think so.
Know so.
I love you, brother.
Call me when you land.
Jesus, you sound like Sarah.
So we want to focus on ad-buys
more in the Quad Cities market, less so in Des Moines.
You're stronger in the East
and we want to turn our twos there into ones.
The "vision" message really resonated
in our focus groups post-debate,
so I think we should cut a new ad centered on that
and weave it into the stump.
Sir?
I'm sorry, what?
Are you good if we change the stump
to focus on the "vision" theme?
I want to go to New Hampshire tomorrow, first thing.
We have you going to Iowa.
I know, but I want to change the schedule.
In every campaign, there comes a time for taking stock.
A time for soul-searching. And...
in the past  hours, I have done just that.

If the goal is a safer, more prosperous America,
I don't need to run for us to achieve that.
All I need to do and what I encourage all of my supporters to do
is to help elect Heather Dunbar to the White House.
  Judas bitch.   While I may be ending my camp  
I'm just pissed off. I'm sorry if I offended.
Yeah, I wonder what she offered her.
Nothing.
Yeah, right.
I know for a fact.
You knew about this?
You should call the President.
"A very hairy, terribly scary tarantula named Tina.
I found her in a shoebox in New York City.
When I first saw Tina I shrieked..."
Were you scared?
Oh, I was terribly scared.
"Tina had poked her head up out of the left shoe..."
  I didn't know you were coming.   She doesn't either.
"So there I was, not knowing what to believe.
Should I leave Tina in the shoebox or set Tina free?"
  Leave her in the box!   Set her free!
  Set her free!   Leave her in the box!
Oh, my Goodness! I don't know what to do!
Nothing! Do nothing!
  What should I do?   Sir, Mr. Grayson needs to speak with you.
  Tell him I'll call him back.   He says it's important.
Later. I'm with my wife.
I don't know what to do!
You shouldn't do anything.
  Let her out!   Don't do anything?House.of.Cards.SE
With just one week to go before the Iowa caucuses,
the latest Gallup poll has
Dunbar ahead by six points,  to ,
with  percent still undecided.
That's a lot of undecideds so close to election day.
Dunbar has incredibly high favorability numbers here,
much higher than President Underwood's,
but I have spoken with many Iowans
who have doubts about her lack of experience
and whether she'll be able to stand up to a Republican candidate
with a substantial record.
Even so, the fact that she's still the frontrunner,
  having never run for office.   It's extraordinary.
Jackie Sharp's endorsement was a big coup.
It really helped her numbers with women.
We want you to have a much more active role during the events.
You'll go first, introduce the president,
stay with him the entire time,
and then participate in the Q and A.
I really shouldn't be answering questions.
Francis is the candidate.
Well, the truth is, your favorables are double what mine are,
so let's give the people what they want.
Well, if you think it will help.
I know it will.
Do you have a speech prepared? Do you have issue papers?
Everything is in the conference room.
Let's get started, then.
Have you had a chance to go over the list...
of replacements for Remy?
Oh, I can't focus on that right now.
I need to get through Iowa first.
Well, I have a suggestion, sir, that's not on the list.
Who?
Me.
Seth, you're invaluable as a comm director.
Well, that's just it, sir.
You need a media expert at the helm.
We're in an election cycle.
  Everything's about perception.   Seth  
I want to integrate the policy and the press teams.
I want to work with cabinet members and agency heads
on gearing every public statement towards our platform.
Mobilize our AmWorks allies in Congress.
A commitment list for future's legislations,
not just simple endorsements.
Look, this outlines in detail
what I would like to do as your Chief of Staff.
All I ask is that you consider it.
Well, of course I will. Thank you, Seth.
I appreciate you putting so much time into this.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Robert.
Sorry I'm running late.
We hit some weather on the way back from Iowa.
I appreciate your coming here in person.
Especially during the... final rush.
Anything for you, Robert.
Have a seat.
Oh, thank you.
And, you know, it's good. I get a few hours with the kids.
So how does it feel to be back here?
I have to admit, I miss it a little.
Your dissent on Godfrey v. Kent was brilliant, by the way.
My clerks. They wrote it.
Every word.
So it's time.
Ruth says it is, but I knew before she said anything.
  When are you going to announce?   Soon.
But I'd like you... to say yes first.
  To what?   Replacing me.
This isn't the disease speaking.
I haven't forgotten you're running for President.
But Underwood...
I'm sure he'd nominate you in a heartbeat.
I am the frontrunner, Robert. Why would I drop out?
Because this position's for life.
Underwood is going to lose.
You think he'll go down easily?
And even if you get the nomination, the Republicans...
They'll... rip you apart.
I'm the swing vote. My seat is important.
You can make a lasting difference here.
That is exactly what he said.
His motivations were atrocious, yes,
but his logic was sound.
Your mind seems sharp as ever, Robert.
Except...
Except for the fact that I can't remember your name right now.
Heather.
Heather.
Will you continue to do the work I've done, Heather?
I can't.
If I'm honest with myself, it's that I want this too much.
I didn't realize it before I started running.
It is not that I've changed, Robert,
that ambition has clouded anything.
It is that I was blind to this until now, what I am meant to be.
And I am meant to be President of the United States.
Wouldn't you all like to hear from Claire first?
Thank you!
Francis and I so appreciate you all coming out here
on such a cold day and welcoming us with such warmth!
It's so good to be back in Iowa!
And I can feel it, with your support and enthusiasm,
there is no doubt that we are gonna take this state!
  Hello.   Good evening.
So pleased to have you staying with us again, Mr. President.
We always love coming here.
It's our favorite house in all of Iowa.
  If you need anything...   Thank you very much.
  Good night.   Have a good evening.
You were wonderful today.
They just adore you.
Good night.
Good night.
Yes, connect me with Tom Yates, please.
No, I'll hold.
Mr. President?
Where's the rest of it?
  Have you read it?   No, not yet.
Just this first chapter arrived.
Will you please read it first, sir? And then let's talk.
Are you sick? You sound hoarse.
Well, no, I'm not sick.
I haven't slept much.
All right, I'll call you tomorrow.
Sir?
Excuse me. Sir?
I forgot why I came in here.
The orange juice.
That'll be two twenty-five.
Yeah.
"The Fourth of July means nothing anymore.
Overcooked hot dogs
and fireworks that always leave you disappointed.
Bite-size American flags made in China,
halfheartedly waved by five-year-olds
who'd rather be playing Minecraft.
But the third of September, that's a date which matters.
It's the day, three decades past,
that a redneck from Gaffney married a debutante from Dallas.
And the Earth's axis tilted that day,
though neither they, nor we, knew it at the time.
Here's a woman who describes her vows
as a suicide flirting with a bridge's edge.
And a man who wears his wedding ring as a badge of shame,
for the debutante deserved more.
But truly, what more could she desire?
Together, they rule an empire without heirs.
Legacy is their only child."
Come in.
He sent you a copy, too?
I thought this was supposed to be about you, not us.
The whole thing was a mistake.
We revealed too much, Francis.
I should've never put you in that position.
I'll put an end to it.
Do you think he was right?
About what?
"A cold fusion of two universal elements,
identical in weight, equal in force.
United they stand. A union like none other.
The unsplittable atom of American politics."
Well, he was right about some things.
I should go speak to him face to face, soften the blow.
She did an event in Oelwein yesterday
and our people say you
could barely hear her with all the cheering.
How badly can she hurt us?
They only need a point or two and he's in the margin of error.
So we need to attack her.
The UN stuff slid right off. We need something new.
Let's talk to Jackie.
Thank you for coming. How was your trip?
Good for me. A little rough for my mom, though.
She's not used to seeing me more than two days in a row.
She actually ran out of questions.
I'm jealous. Have a seat. It's been nonstop here for me.
Full-time job here.
Doing surrogate appearances for Heather in California.
We could really use you, Remy.
A recruiting session?
You can't be surprised.
I was hoping you just wanted to see my face.
We can't offer you as much as you made at Glendon Hill,
but we can offer you a lot more than you made at the White House.
I'm not interested.
That was fast. Even for you.
  Where'd you land?   Nowhere.
I'm out, Jackie. No more politics.
You know you don't mean that. It's who you are.
That's what I thought, too, for a long time.
I don't even know if I'll stay in DC.
What are you gonna do?
That's the best part. I have no idea.
I'll save you the trouble of trying to convince me.
Claire Underwood.
We need to hit her hard.
You want dirt. I don't have any.
You must.
If I did, I don't know if I'd shovel it your way.
But I don't. They never let me in the inner circle.
She pressed him, but nothing.
I find it hard to believe
that we don't have a single thing we can use.
Our OPPO team has looked at every article,
every piece of footage going back  years.
Researched acquaintances, family, the works.
If it's out there, we would've found it.
Wait. There is one thing.
What?
Hello?
Doug. It's been a while.
  What do you want?   The journal.
What would it take?
You said you would never do that to another woman.
  How much?   You're offering money?
If that's what you want.
Betrayal doesn't come cheap.
Name a figure.
What do you like to read?
Do you read?
Yes, I read.
Oh, thank you, Meechum.
  You hate it.   I didn't say that.
You wouldn't fly back from Iowa just to say, "Good job."
Well, look, you've only turned in  pages,
and the book was supposed to be finished by now.
It took me this long to figure out what the book is really about.
And what it's about, is the two of you.
We have to start over.
Start over?
The book was supposed to be about America Works.
Now, you said you wanted to try a different approach.
I was skeptical, but then I went along with it and now,
you've handed over to me the beginning of a book...
about my marriage?
Well, do you want it fast, or do you want it right?
I told you I've never written anything in less than a year.
Yeah, and in a month's time,
you're gonna say you've come up with some new idea.
No, this is it. You and Claire.
The marriage.
That's the key that unlocks everything else.
If I had wanted an expos about my personal life,
I would've hired a staff writer from Us Weekly.
Well... hold on a minute. This is not tabloid bullshit.
You said, in this room, you wanted an original voice.
I am giving it to you.
You're not narrow-minded, Mr. President.
I know you can appreciate what I'm trying to do.
Right, but see, that's the problem right there.
This is about what you're trying to do.
What your needs and... what did you call it?
  Your addiction.   That's not true.
No, it is true. I hired you to do a job,
which was to get me votes.
Yesterday, not six months from now.
Now, look, it's no big deal. It didn't work out.
But I promise you, you will be paid in full.
Thank you, Tom.
This deserves to be finished, and it deserves to be read.
Well, I just happen to disagree with you.
Are you afraid of what I wrote?
Afraid? No.
It's just no one's business.
Well, you can't bury it.
I won't allow that.
You're in an intimate relationship with Kate Baldwin,
isn't that correct?
I've never said anything because I presume that you can
separate your personal life from our professional arrangement.
But before you start getting any reckless ideas,
why don't you just remember one thing: I own this material.
And if you attempt to share it with anybody,
and I mean one single word,
litigation will be the least of your worries.
I mean, after all, I don't think either of us
wants any controversy about the authorship of your first book.
Do we?
Meechum, will you please escort Mr. Yates out?
And good luck to you, Tom.
Too bad about the book.
You don't really mean that.
No, I don't.
Mr. Grayson is on the line, sir.
What was that?
Mr. Grayson is on the line, sir. He says it's urgent.
He's on line one, sir.
Seth?
All right. I better stay in Washington.
Let Vaughn know.
Get me Claire.
You think the timing is strategic?
Well, he and Dunbar are close.
Do you have any idea who you're going to nominate?
We'll go through our master list in the morning,
but this'll take me off the campaign trail.
I won't be in Iowa for a day or two. You're okay to cover me?
Yes, of course. I'll keep waving my pom-poms.
Well, you're a saint to do it without me,
but it's probably best.
They like you even better.
Did you speak with Tom?
I did. He didn't take it well, but I made it very clear.
I read it again. The chapter.
Let it go. We're done with him.
Claire?
Sorry. Uh, the last event went quite long.
I'm fading.
Well, you get some sleep. We'll talk tomorrow.
Okay. Good night, Francis.
Good night.
This is a nice surprise.
Now a bad time?
Not at all. How did you get in the building?
Nobody called me.
The receptionist. Scorpio is her favorite book.
Of course, it is.
What are you working on?
Covert operation in the Jordan Valley.
Your boy Underwood has refused to confirm or deny,
but take a look at that.
That's a letter to the family of Justin Nix.
Navy SEAL who died the same day as the covert operation.
Signed by the president.
Says it was a training exercise.
I just got off the phone with a source in the DOD
and they said there were no SEAL training exercises that day.
His death is the only
military KIA reported on October eighteenth.
Am I shattering your illusions about the guy?
He fired me.
What? Why?
I didn't want to e-mail it to you.
This is it?
The first chapter.
Justice Jacobs served our nation with duty and distinction.
And when the Court was strongly divided,
as it was many times during his  years on the bench,
it was his swing vote
that created legal precedents that will last for centuries.
Now, it will not be an easy seat to fill, but fill it I must.
Sir.
Dunbar's people just reached out to me.
She's back in Washington and she wants to meet with you.
What for?
She wants to talk about the nomination.
She wants to propose someone.
Yes. Herself.
Find a time. And find somewhere discreet.
I don't want anyone on staff seeing her.
Good morning. I'm Claire Underwood.
Uh, I just changed her diaper.
I haven't had a chance to wash my hands.
What is her name? She's beautiful.
  Kayla.   Kayla. And what's your name?
  Suzie.   Hi, Suzie.
Well, I just wanted to thank you so much for your support.
It means so much to my husband and me.
I don't support him.
I saw the signs out front.
Those are my husband's. I support Heather Dunbar.
When we vetted the house, the husband was here.
Um, would you ever consider changing your mind?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Underwood,
I don't really want to be on TV or in the papers.
My apologies about that.
Would you mind if I just came inside?
No cameras, just me?
I guess so.
We need to do a sweep of the house first, ma'am.
No. And they stay out here.
Hello, Heather.
How's Robert?
He's sad.
But at least he's making his exit with grace.
Those were some very nice things
you said about him during your press conference.
Well, what was it you said to me...
about, uh, making things palatable?
  The obscene.   Ah, yes. The obscene.
Well, it is obscene, a mind like his losing its sharpness.
I didn't expect the Oval, but this is interesting.
This is where Petrov and I smoked cigars during the summit.
That's where he put his out on the wall.
So, Seth tells me you want the nomination.
No. I just said that to get in the door.
Robert thought you'd say yes in a heartbeat
if it meant me dropping out of the race.
But the decision you have to make
is whether you'll drop out or not.
And why would I do that?
I know Claire lied about the abortion,
and I have the journal to prove it.
I'm giving you an opportunity to bow out gracefully,
just like Robert.
But you have to do it before the caucus.
I'll give you three days.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The one you asked Doug to destroy.
I wouldn't be so certain that he did it.
So...
you're finally one of us.
One of who?
The men. In their smoky back rooms.
And even if there was a journal...
you don't have it in you.
Make whatever assumption you want.
Well, Robert was right. I would offer you the nomination.
You should take the advice of a smart man.
Three days, Mr. President.
Think about Claire.
Show me out, please.
She can go after me all she wants,
but she goes after Claire,
I'll slit her fucking throat in broad daylight.
Like when he pardoned Walker, and that other guy, the rich one.
  Raymond Tusk.   Yeah, him.
I mean, those were bad people, and he let them off the hook.
And then he says he's not running and he does.
Well, it's a little more complicated
than the way you're putting it.
There's a lot of variables
that go into making decisions like that, and...
I can tell you I was right beside him and he was agonizing.
I'm sorry. She's hungry.
I still breastfeed my girl.
  Go outside, please.   Ma'am?
Just go outside.
I can go out too, if you like.
No, it's okay.
As long as you don't mind seeing some boob.
Does she have any brothers or sisters?
No, this is the only one.
James and I have been trying for a while.
Had some trouble getting pregnant.
  James is your husband?   Yeah. He goes by Jim.
But I like James better.
Well, he must trust my husband. He's supporting him.
James doesn't know what that word means.
  Trust?   Yeah. The whole town knows it.
He runs after anything in a skirt.
Which I don't mind so much, to be honest.
I mean, I've had a fling or two myself.
What I don't like is how he lies about it.
And then, when he asks me if I've been with someone
and I say yes, he flips out.
Like there's some kind of double standard.
I mean, he wants to dog Christy Mulligan
in the back of her brand new Escalade?
Fine. Why shouldn't I be able to give Kyle Beckenbauer some head
for building Kayla's crib?
I'm sorry.
This is what happens when you don't sleep for three months.
You two fight? You and your husband?
Every married couple fights.
I mean, really fight. Like, the cops get called.
Or they would, if he wasn't the president.
'Cause I mean,
the sheriff is practically a family member at this point.
Now we're fighting about the damn election.
Like those stupid yard signs.
Sometimes, I wish I could just pull up stakes and leave him.
But I can't. Why not?
Because of this little one.
Last in vitro we did, I said to myself,
if this one doesn't work, I'm outta here.
We had to double mortgage the house to pay for it.
But it worked. And... here I am.
If I was like you... didn't have a kid...
Can I tell you a secret?
No mother will admit this, but sometimes I fantasize,
like, like this pillow here...
I mean, and when Kayla was in her crib.
Two minutes. That's all it would take, and I could go.
And I wouldn't be stuck to a man I want to leave,
rubbing lotion on my nipples, they're so raw.
I could start over.
Of course, I don't mean it. I mean, I'd never to do that.
But... you have thoughts.
You know what, Suzie,
I think I've taken up too much of your time.
You know I'm not serious, right?
Of course.
I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm so tired.
You're a really good listener.
I wish you were running for president.
Hey, you can tell them I'm for your husband if you want.
I probably won't even caucus.
Good luck to you, Suzie.
Mrs. Underwood, did she change her mind?
No, she stuck to her guns.
But you can't blame a woman for having conviction.
The president just called for you.
I'll call him back from the car.
Listen to me. What I'm about to say, I don't want you to panic.
What is it?
The journal. Dunbar claims she has it.
  But how?   I don't know.
It looks like it might have been Doug.
  He was supposed to     I know. It's hard for me to believe.
No, Francis. This can't happen.
Meechum is tracking him down now.
Sweetheart, listen to me.
No, the whole thing, it   The whole thing  
All she did was make the threat.
That doesn't mean she actually has it.
Whatever you have to do. Just fix it, Francis.
I will, I promise you that.
But in the meantime, you have to come back here.
I need you to get to the plane. You have to come back.
I don't want you there, out on the road, if we get blindsided.
Claire? Claire.
I'll come home.
You go straight to the plane. We'll say you weren't feeling well.
Okay.
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.
Keep coming back. It works if you work it.
So?
You honestly believed he'd go for this?
Yeah.
The writing is good. And it's honest.
But what candidate in their right mind
would want something like this out there?
I need you to write about it. That he's trying to suppress this.
  What you need is sleep.   Do this for me, Kate.
  I can't. It's a conflict of interest.   Come on.
The moment we slept together, we crossed the line.
Fuck the line!
I'm not risking my reputation because your book is dead.
Oh, no. Not dead.
I'm gonna finish it.
I'll change the names if I have to, call it fiction.
He's the President of the United States.
  So what?   He crushes people.
Let this go. Just start something new.
"Start something new."
Jesus... Christ, you don't get it.
I do it all the time.
My editor passes on a story, I move on to the next one.
I'm so fucking disappointed in you right now.
Me?
I'm the one trying to save you from your own delusions.
That's exactly what he said.
Maybe he's right.
I almost felt something for you.
Come in.
Let me take your coat.
Can I get you anything? Something to drink?
No. No, I'm good. Thanks.
I appreciate the home visit, but I'm not gonna change my mind.
No, no. I didn't think you would.
Something wrong?
I don't know what to do.
I figured...
when I asked you to join the campaign,
I just assumed you would say yes.
That the two of us, we would be working together.
And...
I... I...
I can't stop thinking about you.
You're married, Jackie.
For the wrong reasons.
I thought you loved each other.
Not like this.
I'm not the person I want to be.
You're who you need to be. Look at what you've achieved.
But you did it. You gave it all up.
In a heartbeat.
We're different people.
You should go.
Put this behind you.
I guess it was naive to think that we could remain close.
So this is it?
Yeah. It is.
Jackie?
Jackie...
She says she has it.
She doesn't.
How do I know there aren't other copies?
Where do you keep your cigarettes?
In the bowl up there.
Why didn't you destroy it when I first asked you to?
I don't know.
Something stopped me. Maybe I would need it one day.
For you. To prove my loyalty.
You told her. I'd hardly call that loyalty.
I had to show her I was serious.
The journal was a way to do that.
I never came close to putting it in her possession.
Anything else I should know?
I'm sober. It's been  days.
I meant in regards to Dunbar.
It is related. This is a tight race.
Make me your Chief of Staff.
You promised.
You promised there'd be a place for me here when I was ready.
That was before you fell off the wagon
and walked in here with that journal.
I've made mistakes.
I've fallen down more than once,
and you've always been there to pick me up.
But you've been falling down for the past year, too,
and you need someone to pick you up this time.
It's not Remy. It's not Seth.
It's me, Frank.
And how can I know I can ever trust you again?
Because I just lit two million dollars on fire.
We expect higher than usual turnout, anywhere from  to .
The higher the turnout, the better.
We're stronger with women and students.
  We've got a GOTV     Excuse me, I have to take this.
Doug?
I have an update regarding the journal.
What is it?
A message from the president.
I have only one thing to say.
Go fuck yourself.
Christ, that felt good.
Start putting together a shortlist
of potential nominees for the court.
You already...?
I'm on it, sir.
Claire.
Want me to have them make you something
from the downstairs kitchen?
No, I ate on the plane. Just feeling a little warm.
It'll pass.
What did Doug say?
It's destroyed.
I watched him burn the page myself.
  What about copies?   He says there aren't any.
And you trust him?
He had ample opportunity to do us real damage and he didn't.
  But he held onto it for so long     I believe him, Claire.
I believe him.
And I'm gonna make him my Chief of Staff.
Are you out of your mind?
We need him, Claire. We need him now more than ever.
He betrayed us, Francis!
He told Dunbar about me.
To gain her trust, not betray ours.
Look, Doug is the only person we've ever been able to trust,
and he played this very smart.
He never put us in any real danger.
The journal is gone. She can't do anything.
Why didn't you ask me before you brought him back?
  Bec   We're discussing it now.   After you hired him!
Look. I know this must have been harrowing for you,
  but listen, it is ov     No. I don't  
I'm starting to question all of it, Francis.
What any of it is worth. What... what are we doing this for?
For this house.
For the presidency.
Now, look, if you need to take a few days off, that's fine.
You do not have to come with me to Iowa tomorrow.
No. Of course, I'll be there.
Welcome back, Doug. Congratulations.
Thank you.
I just wanted to get a heads up on
when you'd like to make the formal announcement.
Let's do it after the caucus.
I don't want to draw any attention away from the campaign.
You probably shouldn't attend the press briefing today.
No. I'll take off before then.
Here, you should see this.
This just came out ten minutes ago.
Have you shown the president?
I drafted up some talking points.
I figured you'd want to brief him.
I'll be in my office.
Seth.
The president told me you asked for the job.
Yeah, I didn't realize that you were in contention.
I don't want you to resent me.
Hey, I'm a professional.
Let me know if you want any changes made to the talking points.
I'm sure they're good.
You can share 'em with the president.
You don't want to look 'em over first?
No. I trust your judgment.
I can tell you that the shortlist is coming along,
and it is my intention to nominate someone
within the next two or three weeks.
It's very important that we do this quickly,
so that the Senate has time for their hearings.
And we shouldn't leave that seat empty too long anyway,
while the Court is still in session.
  Mr. President?   Sara.
Mr. President, would you comment on Ms. Baldwin's article
about the Jordan Valley operation?
I think Ms. Baldwin's article
is really nothing more than speculation.
  But the evidence...   I'm sorry?
But the evidence she presents is convincing.
Evidence? A letter?
Unfortunately, I have to write letters like that
more often than I would like.
And I don't think it's proof of anything more than
I reached out to the family of a young man
who sacrificed his life for our country
and for which I am eternally grateful.
Mr. President?
Well, Ms. Baldwin, it is your article we're discussing.
I suppose I'd get hammered
if I didn't allow you to ask a question.
Thank you, Mr. President. My question is very straightforward.
You mentioned in the letter
that Lieutenant Nix died in a training exercise.
You signed this letter with your own hand.
Can you tell us in all honesty that this is how he died?
I can tell you that
this is exactly what the Pentagon reported to me.
And beyond that, it's not the policy of this administration
or the Department of Defense to discuss any specifics
about any Special Forces deaths.
May I ask one more, please?
I believe we're finished with that subject now.
It's about Iowa.
Yes, all right. Go ahead.
Your wife has been doing a lot of events.
Did she resign her post at the United Nations
because you think she's more valuable as a campaign asset
than an ambassador?
Claire has been doing a lot of events, that is true,
as she has in every campaign that I have ever run.
I'm hoping, I suppose my strategy is that if the American people
can see that I was smart enough
to marry an extraordinary woman like Claire,
well, they might think I'm smart enough
to be President of the United States.
As for the ambassadorship,
that was entirely her decision, not mine.
She enjoys campaigning, and I'm looking forward to getting back
to Iowa with her a little later today.
Thank you all very much.
We know he's somewhere near Caracas.
I need him back.
The Venezuelans haven't been cooperating.
We have extradition.
Doesn't mean they'll enforce.
Then get me a precise location.
Why?
It doesn't concern you.
It does concern me. There are a lot of people
at the agency who are embarrassed that
he crossed the border without us knowing.
That's not my problem.
Was it you? Passport lock?
The only other agency that could've lifted it is Homeland.
I know you have friends there.
I have friends everywhere.
I'm not gonna help you clean up your mess, Doug.
Not if you helped him escape.
This isn't a request.
I'm Chief of Staff to the president now.
  He hasn't announced anyone.   He will.
And if you want my first official task
to be finding your replacement, so be it.
If not, you tell me where Gavin is.
I watched the press conference this morning.
I think the Baldwin article will blow over.
A non-story. No legs.
You said it was my decision to resign.
Well, it was, wasn't it?
I mean, at least that's how we presented it.
I spoke with a woman yesterday in Iowa, who...
said she couldn't support us...
because she doesn't trust you.
Well, I'm not the first politician that some people don't trust.
We've been lying for a long time, Francis.
Of course we have. Imagine what the voters would think
if we started telling the truth.
Not to them.

Owner's coming in next week.
Anybody off the books, he'll be on my ass.
If I switch some doubles with Benito, is that okay?
Whatever you and him wanna work out.
Welcome to Caracas. The time is :  
We've been lying for a long time, Francis.
Of course we have.
Imagine what the voters would think if we started telling the truth.
Not to them.
To each other.
What do you mean?
You know what? Never mind.
No. How have we been lying to each other?
  We're not.   You just said that.
We've begun our final descent into Des Moines.
Please find a seat and put your seat belts on.
Should we talk?
No. I shouldn't have said anything.
Where is she?
Tell me where she is.
I don't know, man.
  You don't know?   I don't know.
God!
I'm not asking again.
  My computer.   I tried that.
  It's locked.   I'll give you the code.
  You don't have anything more?   That's all I have.
  How current is this?   She's there, I promise.
I found you once. I can find you again.
If this information is wrong, you die.
You try to contact her, you die.
Frank Underwood is a dangerous man.
Because power in the hands of those who lack honesty,
lacks a moral compass.
And without a moral compass, power runs amok.
Heather Dunbar can question my husband's choices.
She can criticize his policies.
But to cast aspersions on his character is proof of desperation.
If he will lie about the death of a US soldier,
what else is he lying about?
We know he already lied about not running in .
The people of Iowa know better.

a strong, decisive leader who doesn't always do what's popular,
but he always does what's right.
The decision you make next Tuesday
is one you'll live with for years.
For three decades, I've stood by my husband's side.
Because I know he stands up for people like you.
You have the power to choose.
Choose progress over pettiness.
You have the power, not him.
Choose a president over a charlatan.
Ladies and gentlemen, my husband,
President Frank Underwood.
Thank you! Thank you very much.
I'm gonna give you one good reason
why Heather Dunbar doesn't stand a chance on Tuesday.
She doesn't have Claire Underwood standing by her side.
I want to spend a few minutes talking about the future
that we are going to build together.
And I say together, because I can't do it alone.
I need your help.
Meet me out back.
  You have it?   Yeah. How about you?
Cassie Lockhart.
Social Security card, driver's license, birth certificate.
It's all legit.
Why "Cassie"? It's not even a real first name.
I mean, if it were short for something, like Cassandra.
  But as your legal name?   It's all there.
Hey, Cassie, take a hundred back if you want it.
My truck's right there.
You keep it.
Come on. I gave you a big discount. Show some gratitude.
Go home to your wife... and kids.
I want you to fuck me, Francis.
  I'm working.   Shut up.
What is going on?
I want you to be rough with me.
  Take me.   Claire.
  Now, listen.   Do it. Now!
Is this what you want?
  You want this?   Yes.
  Yes.   You want it rough?
I want you to look at me.
Look at me while you do it.
That's what I thought.
Yes, I'd like to arrange a room for the First Lady, please.
Yes, right away.
I think you should go back to Washington in the morning.
Sorry I'm late. I did a double at the store last night.
  No worries.   I'll work quick.
About , miles.
It's not much to look at, but... it runs well.
  How much?   Twelve hundred.
But I don't got a title, so
technically, you're just buying it for parts.
Have gas in the tank?
Yeah, you can drive her right out.
  You'll need plates, though.   I got plates.
  Cash okay?   It's all we take.
Underwood! Underwood! Underwood!
Yes, I'm good.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States, Frank Underwood!
Thank you! Thank you very much.
It's good to be back in Iowa City!
Claire couldn't be here today, but she wants you to know
she's a big Hawkeyes fan.
Now here, at one of the country's finest public universities,
I wanna talk to you about Heather Dunbar's preference for  
  Hey, can you do another double tomorrow?   Yeah, no problem.
  All right, have a good night.   You, too.
Hi, I'm Cassie Lockhart.
Hello. Cassie.
Cassie. C-A-double-S-I-E.
Lockhart. L-O-C-K-H-A-R-T.
April st   Just a second!  
I've got rent money for you  
No, no, no, no. I have good news.
Bianca got her protected status.
Oh, my God! That's so great!
She says thank you for all your help with her paperwork.
  Of course.   We're celebrating.
Maria got a bottle from her Thursday house.
They gave it to me for the holidays.
This is nice.
I know, it's really terrible.
She has family in Houston.
They're gonna help her get into community college.
I'm so happy for her.
What about you, eh? You're not staying here forever.
Once I save up enough, I want to get my own car.
And have enough for my own place.
Here in Santa?
Up north, I think. In the woods somewhere.
I miss the trees and the rain.
Someplace quiet.
Something new.
Yeah.
Well, you're a smart girl, Lisa.
I'm sure you're gonna get everything you want.
If Bianca can do it, you can.
To Bianca! And her new life.
  Salud!   Salud!
Sir?
Do you think she can join us tomorrow?
  The press are starting to ask.   If we win,
it'll be strange if she isn't standing next to you
for your victory speech.
Even stranger if you have to make a concession speech.
If I have to make a concession speech,
the absence of the First Lady will be the least of our problems.
I'm going for a run. Can you arrange the detail, please?
Ma'am, if you run in public, it might...
Might what?
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll take care of it right away.
No, if it's a problem with me running, tell me.
It might highlight the fact that you're not in Iowa.
Right there, please.
Quiet.
Help! No!
You want me to put you out again?
Open your mouth. Open it.
I won't make any noise.
You make one sound, or you move an inch...
  What?   I won't.
I won't scream or anything.
Nataly puts the ball on the  ya

Less than  hours to go before the Iowa caucuses,
the Republicans have a broad field with no clear front-runner.
For the Democrats,
President Underwood has gained momentum in the polls.
A rise that many political experts are attributing
to the recent appearance of Claire Underwood in the  
Every major poll has it as a dead heat,
with both candidates hovering at  percent.
That still leaves one in ten likely caucus-goers
who won't be making their decision until tomorrow evening.
Mrs. Underwood, the president is on the phone for you.
President Underwood spent the last full day of campaigning
traversing the state, completing his tour of all  Iowa counties.
  Hello?   Listen.
No matter what happens tomorrow night, I want you by my side.
Are you open to that?
Claire?
I'll fly out in the morning.
No, no. You can come in the afternoon.
You don't have to do any events or press, just...
be there with me when I make my speech.
  I said yes.   Thank you.
Of course.
Last night...
Let's not. I'll see you tomorrow.
  All right. Good night.   Good night.
I'm sorry for what I did to you.
I wish I could take it back.
I told you to be quiet.
I thought I killed you.
When I heard on the news you were alive, I felt so relieved.
  I doubt that.   I mean it.
I would pray for you.
Probably sounds strange, but it's true.
I would, because I felt so bad. You didn't deserve what I did.
None of this is going to change anything.
Where are we going?
Doesn't matter.
Is it gonna be a while? 'Cause I have to pee.
You can pee back there.
You don't want that. The smell.
It's either that or you hold it.
  It hurts.   Too bad.
All right then, I'm gonna do it.
Mrs. Underwood.
Please, come sit.
Thank you for coming.
I'm sorry for how everything has worked out. It's unfortunate.
I'm sure it's been difficult for you,
with all of the effort you put in.
Is this how it works?
He nixes the book, you soften the blow?
No, Tom, it's not that.
Francis doesn't even know I asked you here.
Why did you ask me?
Because I was wondering if...
we could talk honestly to each other.
If you'd be open to that.
  About what?   New Hampshire.
Did you let me pass out that day on purpose?
When I was giving blood.
I let you keep talking. I didn't know you'd pass out.
And you didn't see it coming?
You had things you wanted to say.
And what did I say... before I blacked out?
Was there anything else other than what you wrote?
You don't remember?
Some. But not all of it.
I'm asking for me. Because I need to know.
Hatred.
For how much you and Frank needed each other.
I used that word? Hate?
You did.
And of all the moments...
that you spent with Francis and myself, you...
You believe that we're equals?
I got fired, Mrs. Underwood. I'm not on the clock anymore.
There's a lot more to Francis and me than what you wrote.
Maybe so, but I never got a chance to ask.
Then ask. Whatever you want.
Why aren't you with him? In Iowa?
I'm heading there tomorrow.
You see?
I ask a question, and neither of you answer them.
It's tiresome, constantly swinging a sledgehammer at the faade,
just to get a glimpse through the cracks.
Tell me what you see.
Somebody who's lost.
But I don't know.
Maybe it's all for the best.
I'd rather imagine who you might be
than who you actually are.
Good luck, Claire.
That's enough.
  It calms me.   Then sing it in your head.
You're gonna be able to live with yourself?
What's the point?
I can't hurt you.
No one's ever gonna find me or know who I am.
I'm never gonna say anything.
Quiet.
If it's about punishing me, you don't have to.
This last year, some of the things I've had to do,
I wouldn't wish it on anyone.
I said quiet.
What did the overnight internals say?
Still a toss-up. Less than half a point gap.
  Her or me?   Doesn't matter.
The margin of error is four-point-five.
The last few days, the lead's gone back and forth three times.
Bottom line is turnout.
  Sir?   Yes, I'm almost ready.
May I speak to you for a moment privately?
  Yes. Thank you.   I'll be right outside.
I just got word that Mrs. Underwood has postponed her flight here.
  What? Why?   I don't know, sir.
Also, Agent Swift, the head of her detail...
he said Tom Yates came to the residence last night.
  Tell Vaughn I'll be down in a few minutes.   Yes, sir.
This is Claire. Please leave a message.
This is Claire. Please leave a message.
It's me. When you get this message, will you please call me?
Listen, if you breathe deeply,
you're gonna pass out right away.
  Please.   Then nothing's gonna hurt.
Doug, please. Please.
Help!
No one can hear you. Lie down, Rachel.
Look, Rachel's gone!
That is who I am now.
Look, I know you don't want to do this.
You   You could  
You could've done it in the parking lot last night,
but you didn't, you kept me alive!
I know this isn't who you are.
Please.
Please. Please. Please, just let me go.
Please.
Doug.
Doug, please. Please. Please just let me go.
  Please! Doug! Please!   Fuck!
The president is on the line for you again.
You told him I'm not feeling well?
Yes, ma'am. He'd still like to speak with you.
Tell him I'm sleeping.
I'm sleeping. Please tell him.
Yes, ma'am.
Here.
I don't know why you had to run that night.
All I ever tried to do was keep you safe.
I was afraid. I wasn't thinking.
I'm sorry.
I know you have a good heart.
You're saying that because you want me to let you go.
Look at me.
Look at me, Doug.
You don't have to kill Rachel.
She's already dead.
She died in those woods, and it's better that way.
She didn't have a very good life.
But... But if you do this,
you're not killing Rachel, you're killing Cassie.
And...
all Cassie Lockhart wants to be is someplace far away.
Someplace where nobody'll ever find her.
She likes to go to the movie theater.
It doesn't matter what's showing,
just... she likes the smell of the popcorn.
She wants a dog.
A black lab.
And a queen-size bed.
Lots of blankets to curl up in. She doesn't want much.
She just wants to be invisible.
Hey, look at me.
My name is Cassie Lockhart.
Give me your ankles.
Give me your hands.
Come on.
Let's go.
Some water.
There's a town  miles that way.
First off, I'd like to congratulate President Underwood
for his victory here tonight.
It was a tight race and he came out on top.
No. No, no, no, no!
Let's not be sore losers here.
Because the truth is, we haven't lost.
We are just getting started!
I want to thank all the staff and volunteers
who worked so hard over the past several months.
We should get going.
I want to try Claire one more time. See if she'll come out.
That's three hours from now, even if she left this minute.
But the crowd will wait.
We don't want to squander primetime.
A speech at one in the morning, we lose major viewership.
My children and my dear husband...
Fine. Let's go.
How do you want to handle the stage if she's not on it?
I won't need a stage.
Thank you for coming out.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Well, Iowa has spoken.
And they have spoken so loud,
that I don't even need a microphone.
Listen, I wanted to come down here
to our campaign headquarters in Des Moines,
not go to some fancy hotel ballroom like you know who,
and say to all of you who worked day in and day out,
on our behalf for this campaign, in every corner of this state...
It's because of you that we brought it home tonight!
Now, I know you're all wondering where Claire is.
Some of you may know she's been a little under the weather.
She's from Texas.
She doesn't understand these Iowa winters you have.
But she's on the mend and I'm flying to Washington tonight,
so that tomorrow she and I can get on a plane
and fly to New Hampshire, where we are gonna win there, too!
Claire.
They told me you were down here.
I just wanted to come somewhere to think.
Well, I hope you have.
And that whatever was clouding your mind is gone.
Because I just had to give a victory speech... alone.
And one way or another,
I need you on that plane with me tomorrow.
No. The desk.
Left-hand drawer.
You still have this.
Yes.
It felt wrong to throw it out, for some reason.
When I said we were lying, what I meant was...
For all these years, I thought we were on this path together.
But it's not what I thought it would be.
What I convinced myself it would be,
like what Thomas wrote.
  We're two equal parts.   We are.
You really believe that?
We earned this together.
I said that to your face
the first day I walked in here as president.
It's your office. Not mine.
I have not made a single major decision
without asking your opinion first.
But see, that's it. You make the decisions.
Anything that I want, like the UN...
It made me ill, Francis. My stomach turned.
Why, because you had to resign?
No, because I had to ask for your help in the first place.
That I couldn't get the confirmation on my own.
And what is wrong with asking for my help when you need it?
The fact that I need it.
I hate that feeling. It's not me.
I don't recognize myself when I look in the mirror.
I do things... like I did in the hotel in Iowa.
I can't even talk with you about it.
Instead you want me to slap you around like some animal.
That's what we are when we strip everything away.
  That I can understand!   It was deranged,
begging me to take you like that.
And you couldn't even give that to me.
If you wanted a husband who proved his manhood to you that way,
you should've stayed back in Dallas with your mother
and married the prom king.
At least I would've known where I stood.
No, you can't have it both ways.
You want an equal partner when it suits you?
You want a man to take charge when it suits you?
And I'm supposed to what, just divine when you want which?
Stop being so selfish. You're better than that.
  I'm not being selfish.   You are.
We're in the middle of an election, and look at us.
That's exactly it. Look at us, Francis.
We used to make each other stronger.
At least I thought so, but that was a lie.
We were making you stronger.
And now I'm just weak and small,
and I can't stand that feeling any longer.
All right. What do you want?
What is the goddamn alternative?
Please, Claire, tell me, because I don't understand.
All I am hearing is, it's not enough.
That the White House is not enough.
That being First Lady is not enough.
  Not enough!   No.
It's you that's not enough.
When we lose... because of you...
there will be nothing.
No plan. No future.
We will only be has-beens.
And you want to amount to something?
Well, here is the brutal fucking truth.
And you can hate me, you can be disgusted,
you can feel whatever it is you wanna feel
because frankly, I'm beyond caring.
But without me, you are nothing.
You're right. This office has one chair.
And you have always known that from the very beginning.
And if you now can't stomach that,
well, then I'm a fool for having married you in the first place.
But I don't have time to be a fool.
I have to run this country and win a nomination.
I'm doing my job.
Doug is out there doing his job.
And it's time now for you to do yours.
You want me to take charge? Fine. I will take charge.
You will get on that plane tomorrow.
You will come to New Hampshire.
You will smile and shake hands and kiss babies.
And you will stand with me on a stage.
And you will be the First Lady!
And you do all that.
I don't give a damn if you vomit on your own time.
You're scheduled to depart in  minutes, sir.
Thank you. Check in with the First Lady, make sure she's ready.
Yes, sir.
So?
Are you okay?
I'm good to go, sir.
Yes?
Ma'am, the president wanted me to check and see if you're ready.
Ma'am?
Francis.
I'm not going to New Hampshire.
Yes, you are. I'll see you in the car.
I'm leaving you.
Claire.House.of.Cards.SE
Mayda slides her fingers in...
all the way up to her... her wedding ring.
She pushes you onto your back and leans down.
Puts the fingers into your mouth so you can... taste them.
The gold of the ring...
You could taste the sting of the metal on your tongue...
mixed with the taste of her cunt.
She leans down, whispers in your ear,
"I love you, Gagik.
I love you."
  I'm close, man.   She straddles you, pulls you inside...
grinds her hips back and forth, back and forth  
Ah, damn, you're good with words.
"...New Hampshire for over  years.
There've been ups and downs along the way.
Like the big A-mos-ke-ag."
Am... Amos  
Do you have her?
She won't get on the phone.
  Then get her detail on the phone.   I did.
They can't force her to talk to you, sir.
We need to think about what to say when I show up at this event
and she's not with me.
And I don't want to make it worse by mispronouncing this.
How do you say this word?
They didn't put in the goddamn phonetics in this speech!
And I can't be expected to look this shit up myself!
I'll find out for you, sir.
And of course, there's been...
"...ups and downs along the way."
Like the big Amoskeag strike in the s
over pay and hours.
But this industry survived that as well.
And all of you in this room have been carrying on a tradition
that goes back to the beginning of this country,
and that's something you have to be very, very proud of!
"But there's another tradition in this state:
Live Free or Die.
Now, my wife  "
There's another tradition in this state:
Live Free or Die.
Live Free or Die.
Now, of course, as some of you may read in the papers,
and, uh, hear from the television pundits
that my opponent has a ten-point lead here in New Hampshire.
But...
you're not gonna let polls and pundits tell you what to do.
  No!   Or tell you how to vote on Election Day.
You are gonna show them that New Hampshire makes up its own mind.
Thank you! Thank you all for coming out today.
And God bless America. Thank you.
Underwood! Underwood! Underwood!
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you all. Thank you all very much.
Thank you.
She landed in Dallas ten minutes ago.
Our story is she's down there laying groundwork for the primary.
That only gives us a day or two.
If she's not doing events, they'll think we're hiding something.
You think she'll stay put on the ranch?
I have no idea. You keep track of all of her movements.
Visitors, names, times,
the color of their shit and how much it stinks.
  Yes, sir.   And I want you on a plane.
  Back to Washington?   Down to Texas.
  Where is she?   The master bedroom.
Mrs. Hale mentioned that she might take a nap.
Is my room made up?
It's being dusted right now.
  I'd like to take a look.   Yes, ma'am.
Well, Texas is an important state.
Nearly   of the delegates we need for the nomination.
But you said the First Lady would be here with you today.
Yes, well, when we assessed things this morning,
we felt good about New Hampshire.
I mean, look at this crowd, the enthusiasm.
Hello, hello. Oh, my goodness.
Hello there, aren't you a cutie? What's your name?
  Gabby.   Hello, Gabby.
Anyway, we wanted to start looking ahead.
Claire's from Texas,
so it made sense for her to head down there early.
Hello. Hello. Thank you for coming out.
I can't do my job if you keep me in the dark.
All you need to know is what you put out in the statement.
  Was it an argument?   Seth.
Look, I'm working  hours a day here on a normal day
with the campaign in full swing, and now this is on my plate?
Look, I can do damage control,
but I have to know what the damage is.
Okay. I'll fill you in. Let me get up to my room.
Welcome to Dallas.
Or maybe it's a decoy,
trying to lure us into making ad-buys in Texas.
That would explain why it wasn't part of her schedule.
Have you spoken to our friends in Dallas?
No meetings or calls.
If she were making the rounds, we'd know.
Well, they're either excellent at covering their tracks,
or something's up.
  Like what?   I don't know, but I wanna find out.
She's gonna fucking leave me. My kid in her belly.
And she gonna act like I never existed.
Probably pawned the wedding ring already.
  How many is that?   Two more.
  Can you blame her, though?   Yeah, I can blame her.
I gave her everything. She gonna rob me of my kid?
He's gonna be in high school before you're out.
I'll still be his fucking father.
You gotta let them move on, man.
  It's unfair not to.   Let me tell you about unfair.
Okay? Unfair is I'm even in here,
and that fucking bitch doesn't even know it.
She thinks I belong in this shithole?
You did kill a guy.
  Are you saying you didn't?   I didn't say shit.
Because I...
I had my doubts.
What do you mean your doubts?
Just...
never struck me as a killer, that's all.
You don't know what I am!
Come on!
Let up! I can't breathe.
All I'm saying is...
I interviewed a lot of murder suspects
when I was on the crime beat.
I think you're innocent.
I think you didn't do it.
These guys, they'll skin you alive.
Make you watch in a mirror while they do it.
What guys?
You ever hear of Armenian Power in LA?
  No.   Their top guy.
No way that motherfucker was going to jail, huh?
I didn't have a choice.
So, you didn't do it?
It doesn't matter what I did or what I didn't do.
It matters what I said I did.
Who did you take the fall for?
A national Wall Street Telegraph poll finds
Governor Conway leading the Republican field
with   of GOP primary voters saying he's their first choice,
over   more than any other candidate.
Conway has had a dramatic ascent
since he announced his candidacy in May of .
In another Wall Street Telegraph poll conducted at the time,
he only captured   of GOP primary voters.
Many felt that his young age and his lack of...
Meechum!
  Yes, sir?   Claire's clothes are here.
I'll get Advance.
Along with his campaign's focus
on his successful tenure as Governor of New York,
his service in the Air...
My apologies, sir.
Her wardrobe shipped last night and we neglected to adjust.
  All right, just get it out.   Yes, sir.
Hundreds of supporters lined up
at nearly every one of his Iowa events,
sometimes numbering in the thousands.
Prominent in the crowd were military veterans.
Conway's grandfather was a Navy chief warrant officer
who fought in the Pacific theater of World War II.
  Conway's approach has been likened...   Meechum.
...to that of John F. Kennedy's  presidential campaign.
A combination of public charm and personal poise.
Last week, at a campaign event...
This morning when you went into her room...
Uh, I told her we were leaving soon.
She just...
She was looking at a photograph...
of the mandala, the one you gave her.
...event in Manchester, but without the First Lady.
  Reports from the Underwood administration...   Good night, sir.
   ...have stated that Claire Underwood...
  Keep me company for a bit.   Sir?
You just have a seat. I've got some reading that I have to do.
Yes, sir.
But you said the First Lady would be here with you today.
Yes, well, when we assessed things this morning,
we felt good about New Hampshire.
I mean, look at this crowd, the enthusiasm.
Hello, hello. Oh, my goodness.
Hello there, aren't you a cutie? What's your name?
  Gabby.   Hello, Gabby.
Turn that off.
Claire's from Texas,
so it made sense for her to head down there early.
Hello. Hello. Thank you for coming out.
"Hmm, aren't you a cutie?"
  What are you doing?   You fell asleep, sir.
Your glasses, I was...
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to...
  You all right, sir?   No.
I mean, yes. I'm just...
  Can I get you anything? Some water?   I'm fine.
It's late. You should get some sleep.
I'll stay if you like.
I think I'd like to be alone, but thank you.
Of course, sir.
Watch your step, please.
  LeAnn.   Mrs. Underwood.
  Let's take a walk.   Of course.
You've made the Democrats relevant again in a very red state.
You want me to help ramp up the Texas operation?
No, I'm not here for the primary.
I'm here to run for the th,
and I want you to run my campaign.
The White House is saying that you're here to  
That's just so we don't draw attention to the congressional race.
Doris Jones, her daughter's running.
The congresswoman would need to be convinced.
You're saying Celia bows out?
She waits. In two years, the seat is hers.
Four at the most.
  Senate?   Possibly.
Or governor, .
And the president's on board with this?
Completely.
Look, even if you could convince Celia,
there's still a big problem.
  That I'm white.   Lily white.
In your designer heels and tailored dresses, I mean...
look at this property, Mrs. Underwood.
A woman who marched with Dr. King
is not gonna have much patience for...
For what?
An outsider.
Well, I believe we can change her opinion of me.
Look, I don't mind betting against the odds.
If I did, I wouldn't be consulting for Democrats in Texas.
  But what you're asking me     When you started your firm, LeAnn,
your father told mine that you were making a huge mistake.
That's because he was a Republican.
Yes, but you didn't make a mistake, did you?
You proved him wrong.
Now, a dozen consultants can tell me why this won't work,
but I think you can tell me why it can.
Meechum said she was in there for over an hour.
We don't own Harvey.
Vaughn thinks she's been holding out for Dunbar.
She wouldn't be meeting with her about the primary.
Maybe she thinks she can run for something.
  What? This cycle?   Elected office has always been her goal.
There aren't any open races.
Not in Texas. Except for Doris Jones.
Yeah, but her daughter's running for that seat.
She hasn't announced yet.
Which gives Claire an opening.
Hello?
  Hello?   LeAnn?
Doug Stamper.
Wasn't sure if I was in the right  
Is that how you say hi in Texas?
Sorry, the elevators are usually locked down on the weekends.
We've had some burglaries in the building.
  It's nice to meet you, Doug.   Pleasure.
Mrs. Underwood didn't tell me you were in town.
I just got in. President thought it'd be a good idea
if I were here to help coordinate on the campaign.
Well, I'm not officially on board yet.
I wanted to see how the meeting goes tomorrow.
The meeting?
Doris Jones. The First Lady didn't tell you?
No.
Will you excuse me for a moment?
  I just have to make a quick call.   Of course.
It's the president.
Hello?
Doug tells me you greeted him with a firearm.
Yeah, we've been having some issues with  
Do you know what fascinates me about guns, LeAnn?
You pull a trigger and bang,
a bullet explodes out faster than the speed of sound.
And if you're on the wrong end of that bullet,
why, it hits you before you even hear it.
Mr. President, forgive me, but  
No, I want you to hear me, LeAnn.
You will walk away from this nonsense with Claire.
You will not make a phone call nor answer one.
You will offer no explanation.
Whatever you discussed with my wife,
you will erase it from your mind and never speak of it again.
Tell me I've been heard.
Yes, I heard you.
Good.
This is cute.
Put it down, please.
Souvenir.
I'll take that phone, too.
Have a good night.
How soon?
The judge is reviewing the Rule  order now.
I mean, once he signs it, if they make an arrest,
it won't take these guys long to figure out
it was me that talked to the Feds.
Well, once he signs, it'll be a matter of hours, not days.
The WITSEC arrangements are already being made.
  You know where they're sending me?   Nope.
And I never will. Nobody will.
Except for the DOJ.
If you need to reach me for anything,
you're gonna have to contact me through the WITSEC officer.
It's not just the Armenians I'm afraid of.
  Lucas...   I know you never believed me
  about the president but     Look. Listen carefully.
The U.S. Government is not your enemy now.
Okay? They're protecting you.
He is the government.
Not even the White House knows who gets released on Rule .
Unless the Attorney General tells them,
which almost never happens.
Listen.
You did good work here, Lucas.
You're getting out.
Try to be happy about that.
This how you unwind?
I've never been here in my life.
I wanted some place we wouldn't be recognized.
Rack 'em up.
  You said you had something to offer.   Yes.
Insurance.
We took Iowa.
We're closing the gap in New Hampshire.
You squeaked by in Iowa.
You're not gonna close the gap in New Hampshire by Tuesday.
  You're overconfident.   And you're still Press Secretary.
He didn't make you Chief of Staff.
Don't tell me you weren't angling for it.
What's your ask?
One solid thing for us to work with.
It tanks him, you got a cushion.
It doesn't?
You still have your job in the White House.
Why should I trust you?
Wouldn't you rather have a back-up plan in your pocket if you lose?
Your shot.
We guarantee you a place in our administration
after my two years as Chief of Staff.
Then it's you.
Tell me what's happening in Texas.
  Mrs. Underwood.   Congresswoman, so good to see you.
Wonderful to see you, too. Please, come in.
Celia, so good to see you, too.
Always a pleasure, Mrs. Underwood.
LeAnn called me a little while ago. Said she couldn't make it.
Congresswoman, I asked LeAnn to have this meeting set up
because I have a radical proposal,
and I wanted to make it in person.
Well, Doug has already filled me in.
Usually, I wouldn't endorse anyone four years out,
but in this case, I'm really open to it.
Anything to put a Democrat into the governor's mansion.
I told the congresswoman that
enlisting her political machinery in Dallas
is a crucial first step.
Which is why I asked my daughter to join us.
She'll have my seat by then, and you two will work closely.
I have a great deal of respect for you, Mrs. Underwood.
I think we can accomplish a lot together.
Well, actually, Congresswoman,
I've decided that the governorship is a big leap
without holding any elected office first.
Are you thinking Senate next cycle?
No, I'm thinking your district, this cycle.
That would mean your daughter holds off,
and then I would throw my full weight behind her
to replace me when I run for governor.
I've already put together my team.
Oh, no, you would still get the seat, Celia.
I'm just asking you to wait a little longer.
And the president thinks this is the best plan.
Why didn't you tell me this?
  I wasn't aware, ma'am.   Well, he and I spoke privately about it.
Celia has waited over a decade for me to retire.
It's her time.
I understand.
And that's why I want to put her in the best position to succeed
  when she takes office.   When was the last time
you set foot in this district?
When Francis was elected whip.
So, how are we supposed to ask our people to support a woman
that doesn't even know them?
Their lives, their everyday struggles.
Carpetbagger.
Who's white.
It goes deeper than race, Mrs. Underwood.
You grew up in Highland Park, never wanted for anything.
You just don't reflect our community.
Congresswoman makes a good point.
What I want is a stepping stone.
And what you want is federal funding for a breast cancer center
run by Planned Parenthood.
Something that a Republican-controlled Congress will never do.
Especially in a VA hospital.
You had resistance even when the Democrats controlled the House.
But there's not one congressperson, Republican or Democrat,
that would refuse a meeting with the First Lady.
You're right, Mrs. Underwood.
We haven't accomplished everything we set out to do.
But the one thing my constituents have always had...
is the pride that they take in being represented by one of their own.
I refuse to rob them of that.
Thank you for your time, Congresswoman.
We'll reassess our thinking and get back to you. Thank you.
You tell the president to stay out of this.
Maybe you should speak to him directly.
As soon as he's willing to support this race, I'll talk to him.
You're making a mistake, Mrs. Underwood.
A source within the White House tells us this,
that the First Lady traveled to Texas
after some sort of a major argument with her husband.
Well, the president has claimed that she went to Dallas
to lay groundwork for the Texas primary.
But there's no evidence of any campaign events or fundraisers
since she arrived there three days ago,
and she hasn't appeared publicly.
So, Monica, gotta get your take on this.
Well, if there is marital discord,
the Underwoods certainly wouldn't want to admit it.
Her being down there for the primary?
Come on, that could be a smokescreen.
  Juan?   Well, come on, Gretchen. Let's be real.
Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
I mean, the timing on this could not be worse.
Don't forget, the New Hampshire primary is tomorrow.
So, whatever momentum the president had coming out of Iowa...
Just like air going out of a popped balloon.
Well, you know that Heather Dunbar
is gonna have something to say about this. Let's take a look.
I don't know whether this story is true or not,
but if it is, I hope that the president and the First Lady
can work out their differences.
No one likes to see a marriage under strain.
Personally, I wouldn't be able to carry on my campaign
without the incredible...
Do we know where the leak came from?
We're talking to Secret Service and to staff now,
but no, sir, we don't know yet.
I'm looking at a ten-pound stack of clippings,
and that's just what's been written in the past hour.
This is Dunbar. I know she's behind this.
Sir, I might have a solution.
May we speak privately for a moment?
Yeah. Seth, hop off the line.
If we're gonna switch tactics, I think I should  
I'll fill you in if the president wants to move forward.
Hop off, Seth.
During the debates, we all remember,
Underwood went after Sharp for sending her kids to private...
All right, go ahead.
Claire's mother.
What about her?
I told you when you were five years old
not to come in this house without saying hello to me.
I came by when I arrived. You were asleep.
That was two days ago.
Well, I wasn't sure you wanted to see me, Mother.
Well...
as long as we're living under the same roof
  and besieged by news trucks     I apologize for all that.
Is it true?
Is that why you came down here?
No, I came down here because...
That woman who visited...
  LeAnn Harvey.   Mmm-hmm, I know who she is.
She calls me all the time asking for money when she's...
peddling some candidate.
Are you the candidate?
Congress. th District.
I see.
You don't approve.
Well, you've always made your choices
regardless of what I think.
What does he think?
Has he spoken to you? To discourage me?
He hasn't spoken to me since the day of your daddy's funeral.
Just like you haven't.
Not even a phone call when you became First Lady  
If you don't want me here, I can make other arrangements.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
This house is as much yours as it is mine.
I put covers on everything
because the maids were cleaning rooms I never set foot in.
But now that you're here...
Just leave them.
I only need a bedroom.
Fine.
This house is just a hotel to you.
The president will arrive in Dallas later this afternoon.
As to the nature of his trip, I can't comment at this time
other than to say he plans on seeing the First Lady.
  Seth!   Mark.
His going down there would seem to lend legitimacy
to claims that they're having marital issues, wouldn't it?
We've already denied those claims.
  Seth!   Sara.
Neither the president nor the First Lady
have publicly responded since this story broke.
Can we expect them to?
What you're calling a story isn't a story.
It's a flashy headline
that gives you a bump in Twitter followers.
It doesn't warrant a response,
but if the president or First Lady chooses to make one,
you'll be the first to know.
  Seth!   Thank you all very much.
  How long has she been gone?   Not long.
  LeAnn Harvey's office.   Christ.
The press didn't follow her, did they?
No. They took a utility road out.
No police escort.
Are you two gonna make a habit of showing up here
without even the courtesy of asking?
I wish I didn't have to be here,
but your daughter's made it necessary.
You know, when she got married,
I was sure she would wake up in a year or two.
I had no idea it was gonna take her .
Claire is the First Lady of the United States,
and you still think she made the wrong choice.
Reduced to tabloid gossip?
She might as well be living in that trailer park you come from.
Well, it was a peach farm.
But you're right, I am still white trash.
I just happen to be white trash that lives in the White House.
Not even being president could give you any class.
Well, let me tell you what's about to happen, Elizabeth.
I am not going to put myself in the crossfire
between a president and First Lady.
Oh, I'll handle Francis.
You said he was on board.
And I'll make sure he is.
The point is you misled me, Mrs. Underwood.
What is it you want, LeAnn? Is it money?
Or do you want more, to make a real mark?
I don't have to choose. I can have both.
Well, if you wanna make history, you need to get out of Texas.
I've turned down plenty of jobs in D.C.
Juggling  clients a year.
But I want the next  years of your life.
Texas is just where we begin.
It seems you didn't hear me after all.
I don't respond to threats.
You're speaking to the president.
Yes, I recognize his voice.
I'd like to talk to my wife alone, please.
She stays. Tell me what you need to tell me.
Doug.
She's been sick for three years.
Radiation, chemotherapy, the works.
But you didn't know, did you?
You're not dragging my mother in front of the cameras.
Just you, and you're going to say that that's why you're down here.
This is a family matter, Francis.
This has to be done, Claire. We have to kill this story.
He's right.
I need to know you won't meddle with my campaign.
The State of the Union is in two weeks.
You show up for that, then I'll leave you alone.
Let's get this over with.
When Claire first came down here to Dallas...
we said it was to lay the groundwork for the Texas primary.
And that was partially true.
What we left out was something that we hoped to keep private.
But in light of false stories over the last number of days
about the state of our marriage,
we now feel it's important to share this unfortunate news.
Claire.
For the past three years,
my mother has been suffering from intermittent lymphoma.
Initially, she had some success battling her illness,
but it's come back full force the last several months.
So, I came down here to spend time with her
while she undergoes further treatment.
And we ask just for the sake of my mother's dignity...
and well-being that you respect her privacy.
Thank you.
I will be resuming my campaign tomorrow
and Claire will, of course, be staying here.
And let me just add...
Claire's mother is blessed to have such a loving daughter.
And I am blessed to have such a thoughtful and caring wife.
Thank you all very much.
Nothing fancy, but it'll do the job.
You're officially John Carlyle now.
Driver's license is expired on purpose. You take the bus to work.
Memorize everything, address, birthday, social.
There's a personal history in there for you to know by heart, too.
  "Pegasus Car Rentals"?   Yeah.
You wash rentals. It starts tomorrow.
Keep a low profile.
Don't be weird about it,
don't go out of your way to make friends.
What if there's...
If something's wrong?
Landline goes directly to our local office.
Away from home, use the cell phone next to it.
What else? You have basic cable.
No Internet, obviously.
Keep the blinds drawn and the doors locked.
That's it.
I'll check in with you later this week.
Now, we didn't just win a plurality here in New Hampshire.
We won a majority.
Now, you know what that tells me?
It's looking like Dunbar's got it by  or  points
by the time everything's counted.
How many precincts have reported?
As of two minutes ago,  .
Seth drafted a speech for when we land.
Normally, Dunbar would wait to give her speech until after yours,
but since we're on the plane  
  Get her on the phone and I'll concede.   Yes, sir.
Look at that snot-nosed pretty-boy.
I'll bet he just learned how to shave.
Get me Dunbar.
  Ma'am, I really think     Open it.
She wants to be left alone.
Unlock the door.
I want you to go!
Mother...
why didn't you tell me?
Because it was none of your business.
  Just listen to me.   No, don't even bother.
I understand why you did what you did.
But that doesn't make it any less hurtful.
Is that for me or for yourself?
Claire.
Come here.
Come here.
You're stronger than he is.
But you gotta put him in his place.House.of.Cards.SE
He is a classless, graceless, shameless barbarian.
What he did to you, Elizabeth, it was disgusting.
  Awful.   Just vile.
  Can you pass the plate of...   Yeah.
But why didn't you tell us?
The thought of you fighting this alone, all those years...
I didn't want pity.
Is it true that they were arguing?
No, she came down here to be with me.
Of course, we didn't expect
that it was gonna be made a public display.
I guess he thought that was the best way to dispel the rumors.
That man does not deserve to be president.
I've never wanted to speak ill of him, Elizabeth,
but when I think of the way he's treated you and Claire...
Oh, stop now. He is still her son-in-law.
No, Bar's right.
He doesn't deserve to be president.
You could... all help me, actually.
  Anything.   Just say the word.
Heather Dunbar.
We should be supporting her.
With our checkbooks.
You really want him to lose?
When he loses, Claire can begin her own career...
which is far more important to me.
I don't know if we can really make a difference, but...
I'd rather do more than just sit around and bad-mouth him.
So, we just write a check?
Now, Francis can't know.
I mean, our donations will have to be... once removed.
That amendment has stalled for years.
Because we didn't have someone in Veterans Affairs.
It isn't a veterans issue. It's public health.
That's not my specialty.
Wait, you're telling me
you don't know anyone who's had breast cancer?
I mean in terms of legislation.
Fifty percent more.
That's how many more black women
die of breast cancer than white women.
In our district, it's higher than the murder rate.
Help us get this clinic.
I don't deny that it's an important issue,
but I have to pick and choose what I support.
You're in a tight race back home, Congresswoman.
We'll set up a super PAC.
Three million dollars.
You did this without talking to me?
Claire and I spoke at length, Mother.
Claire?
You're calling the First Lady by her given name, now?
Well, and I would hope you would, too, Congresswoman.
You went behind my back, Mrs. Underwood.
I'm not asking for a full endorsement.
I'm just asking for your blessing on Celia delaying her run.
And of course, a promise to not campaign against me.
Jackie Sharp's big on Dunbar.
Why would she help you?
This money isn't directly linked to us.
You mean the president's comfortable
putting money in Jackie's war chest?
He is, but we have to keep this quiet.
There can't be any communication between your office and his.
  Speech?   Seth put in your latest edits.
Once you approve, we'll send it to the teleprompters.
  Has she arrived yet?   A few minutes ago.
Please sit down.
If Jackie gets cold feet, we can't leave her any choice.
I'm already on top of that.
How?
They always use the same hotel.
I've got a guy set up across the street.
I'm assuming you're being careful.
I'm not just a tech outfit. I can go old school, too.
Ma'am? We have lunch prepared for you.
This is impressive.
Well, soak it up while you can. We won't be here long.
I'll be right back.
Anatoly Rostropov. His empire's worth  billion.
Petrov had him killed last night.
Stanislav Ustravich,
founder of Turkas Oil.
Found dead early this morning.
Igor Milkin, media tycoon worth  billion.
Very outspoken against Petrov
after the government seized his TV stations and newspapers.
His private plane landed in Bangor, Maine, two hours ago.
We've got him quarantined on the tarmac.
He's seeking political asylum. Says he's in fear for his life.
We believe they've been formulating a plan to unseat Petrov.
Brutus, Cassius, and the one that got away.
Moscow's adamant we send him back immediately.
Then send him back.
I don't want the State of the Union
overshadowed by some asylum dispute.
He's Petrov's problem, not ours.
Legally, sir,
we are obligated to process his asylum request.
  Don't tell me the press knows he's here.   No, sir.
We jammed communications on his plane
as soon as it entered U.S. airspace.
Then we don't have a problem, do we?
It's likely he'll be killed if we send him back.
So be it. He tried to slay a dragon and he missed the mark.
Now he's gotta face the fire.
Our fear is more killings, more company seizures.
That leads to a run on the banks,
collapse of the ruble, default on debts.
And we already know
he's been back-channeling about a bailout
with the IMF.
Well, if you have a proposal to make, then make it quickly.
  I have a speech to prep for.   Yes, sir.
Last year you wore the taupe, so maybe this is too similar?
Come in.
I was able to get Mrs. Hale on the phone.
Oh, great. Uh, could you excuse me for a moment?
  Mother?   You doing okay, Mrs. Hale?
Yes, thank you.
Who was that?
I'm treating myself to a pedicure.
Nobody can hear me.
You wanted to talk?
Yes, I wanted to thank you, for all of your help.
Uh, it looks like the congresswoman is leaning toward a yes.
You know, I was thinking, when you run,
you should use your maiden name instead.
Mother, I couldn't do that. It would look bad.
Well, then how about if you...
if you use Claire Hale-Underwood?
That has a nice ring to it.
Maybe.
  Have you seen him yet?   No, not yet.
What are you gonna wear tonight?
I was just deciding that now, actually.
Something dark, I hope.
Well, it's between black and ivory, and to tell you the truth,
this ivory is so beautiful  
Oh, for God's sakes, don't wear ivory.
Even with your figure,
it'll accentuate all the wrong places.
Are you going to watch the speech?
Mother?
Yes, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna have Michael put a TV in the bedroom.
Mrs. Underwood, the president is ready for you.
I'll be right out.
Mother, I have to go.
Yes, I   Of course. I'm sure you must be very busy.
I'll see you when I get home?
If I'm asleep...
Then I'll see you in the morning.
Goodbye, Mother.
Bye. Wear the black!
I don't want even the slightest chance this gets out.
We set up a perimeter. And we'll cover the tail number.
Good. Set up a call with Petrov, for after the speech.
It'll be : a.m. in Moscow.
Oh, I guarantee he'll be watching.
Sir? I think you should take this.
Excuse me.
Hello, Congresswoman.
Sorry for the delay. Please sit down.
Did you get the earrings?
I did. Thank you.
My mother's. Two-carat diamonds.
For tonight.
There's nothing quite like diamond earrings.
Shall we begin?
Uh, this year, we're handling the arrival a bit differently.
You'll be escorted to the rotunda for a photo op with the leadership
before going to the holding room.
I don't need to go to the holding room.
You can take me directly to the gallery.
Yes, that's fine. Whatever the First Lady prefers.
And we'll need two separate motorcades after.
I'll be going straight to the airport.
  Two motorcades, then.   Yes, sir.
I'd like to brief you on the list of special guests attending  
This all seems pretty straightforward.
I'm good if you are.
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you so very much.
Do you have a moment?
How's Elizabeth?
She sends her regards.
I'll bet she does.
And the campaign?
Still exploring viability.
Doris isn't on board yet?
Uh, we'll see.
What have you offered her?
Well, I want to put together a solid campaign strategy with LeAnn
before engaging her again.
Well, if you need my help, let me know.
She and I were very close when I was whip.
  You've got a lot on your plate.   No, it's no trouble at all.
I'll let you know.
See you tonight.
You ready to prep, sir?
  I need to make some changes.   I'll call the speech writers.
No, I wanna do these myself. And track down Calista.
We have to make room for one more guest.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
I'm having it removed.
Well, that's too bad. I liked it.
Hmm, time to move on.
From what?
From the me that needed a tattoo.
I don't have much time.
When do you have to be at the Capitol?
Less than an hour.
  Whiskey or vodka?   Vodka.
How well do you know Doris Jones?
Oh, uh, met her a few times. I don't know her that well, though.
  Why?   Her daughter, Celia,
wants me to help them get appropriations
for a breast cancer clinic.
In return, they want to pad my campaign with Texas money.
  How much?   Three million.
To start.
Her district doesn't have that kind of money.
Celia says they're courting donors from outside the th.
But one of my aides
heard that Claire Underwood and LeAnn Harvey
were in Jones' office today.
LeAnn's someone I know.
Glendon Hill was courting her a few years ago.
Did she turn you down?
We couldn't afford her.
Look, I know you're out of the game, but this is a lot of money.
If it's legit, it could really help me. But if it's not, I  
I'll talk to LeAnn and see what I can find out.
Here.
I want to taste you first.
This is a special report.
President Francis Underwood's State of the Union address
to a joint session of Congress.
Tonight the eyes of the world are on Washington.
President Underwood will take the stage in just a few minutes...
Take the food away.
You didn't eat your lunch, Mrs. Hale.
Yeah, well, I didn't feel well.
Then you really should eat dinner. Your medication  
Please don't make me ask you again, Michael.
Just take it away. The smell of it is making me ill.
Yes, ma'am.
Ladies and gentlemen, the First Lady of the United States.
  Celia.   Thank you so much for arranging this.
It's a big honor to be sitting next to you.
Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.
Interesting place to watch the SOTU.
It's more fun this way. You know, hanging with the hoi polloi.
So, what brings you to D.C.?
Well, all of Congress in town, it's good for hustling work.
Since when do you hustle? You turn people away.
How'd you know I was in town?
I might be retired, but I still have my ear to the ground.
So that's true? The great Remy Danton has hung up his jersey?
I've never felt better.
  Don't tell me this is a social visit.   No.
  Well, if it isn't business...   It's business.
  Members of Congress...   Okay.
  ...I have the high privilege...   So...
  Oh, hold on. The show is starting.   ...of presenting to you,
the President of the United States.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President,
members of Congress, my fellow Americans.
One year ago,
when I gave this address for the first time,
it was during a very different period for our country.
Our nation was recovering from a political scandal
and a trade crisis with China.
Before you stood a president no one had elected.
But that same man stands before you now,
and the darkness is behind us.
The state of the union is bright, and getting brighter.
We've had our challenges, yes.
Particularly with Russia.
There were some tense moments, to be sure,
and yet we overcame those tensions.
President Petrov let us continue to build trust
and show that we've learned from our experiences last year.
And I'd personally like to acknowledge the First Lady,
who led the way in repairing those burned bridges.
She's getting more applause than the president.
Good for you, isn't it?
Quite a high-profile client.
Who told you that?
  Just a guess.   No, you guessed wrong.
So what do you know about big Texas donors...
who care enough about a poor Dallas district
to donate money to a campaign in California?
That went right over my head.
First Lady was in Dallas. You were in Dallas.
The First Lady is here.
Now you're here.
I think you have far too much time on your hands, Remy.
Your fingerprints are all over this money.
You're working for Jackie Sharp now?
No. Just friends.
  Just friends, huh?   Yeah.
I think your fingerprints are all over her.
How about this?
You don't poke around in my shit...
and I won't poke around in yours.
It was good to see you, Remy. Don't get too soft in retirement.
Now, it's considered uncouth
for a president who's in the midst of a campaign,
to talk directly about the upcoming election, but tonight,
I feel compelled.
Because the votes our electorate casts
during the current primaries and the general election in November
will have a profound impact on everyone in this room.
Some of us, myself included, may find ourselves out of a job.
If we want to keep our jobs,
we have to listen to the American people.
We have to work harder! We have to deliver!
Just like Doris Jones.
She has kept her job in Congress for  years
because she never relented in the face of adversity.
In fact, just today, she called me about a breast cancer clinic
she has been fighting for over the past decade.
Now, her plan is bold.
A VA hospital expansion open to the general public,
financed by federal money.
A bold plan that will significantly increase successful diagnoses
and treatment through education, screenings, and affordable care.
Now, she's gotten resistance, time and again...
from the Veterans Affairs administration,
from her colleagues in Congress...
  Can you turn it up a bit?   ...from those who don't want to see
government funds going to Planned Parenthood.
And yet, when she called me today,
she was just as passionate about this clinic as she was
when she first brought it up to me ten years ago.
Well, Doris, it worked.
I'll be working with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs,
HUD and the congressional leaders to get you that clinic.
Because of you, we'll save lives.
And that is exactly the sort of leadership the American people want.
More leaders like Doris Jones.
And when she retires at the end of this term,
I'm delighted to say that her daughter, Celia,
will run for the open seat
to continue delivering just like her mother has.
No fucking way.
And I, for one, will support
your candidacy with everything I've got.
And I know Claire will, as well.
Texans are tenacious.
I'm proud to be married to one,
and I'm proud to have served with one,
like Congresswoman Jones.
Thank you, Doris, for all your years of service,
and thank you, Celia, for picking up the mantle.
Doris said her daughter spoke out of turn,
that she didn't know about the deal she was brokering with Underwood.
Did you connect with LeAnn?
No, I didn't.
She said she couldn't meet until tomorrow.
Well, I guess there's no point now, anyway.
If the White House is orchestrating the funding,
Underwood's not gonna want my help.
Fuck! I really could've used that money.
Well, when it looks too good to be true...
Yeah, I know.
When am I gonna see you again?
I don't know.
I've been... feeling a bit stir-crazy.
If I'm retired, I should probably travel some.
Well, you could travel to California.
I'll be there more than here until November.
Yeah, maybe.
Or don't.
You know how to reach me.
Do you think it was Remy?
Highly doubtful. I made it clear what we knew.
He knows you have proof?
He knows that I know. Not that I have proof.
Maybe we shouldn't have played that card yet.
Remy was connecting the dots.
I needed to put the brakes on him.
Well, if it wasn't him,
Doris must've gone to Francis himself.
She saw an opening and  
Ma'am, there's been a change of plans.
Uh, hold on. What change of plans?
We're taking you back to the White House.
No, we're going to Andrews.
I'm sorry, this is direct from the president.
This is not gonna be as difficult as it seems.
Now, Terry's gonna be in touch with Veteran Affairs
first thing tomorrow to draft an amendment.
And if the Republicans give us any resistance in committee,
I'll start making calls.
No reason why this can't get to the floor
before the end of the session.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
Thank yourself. You played this well.
How did you play it?
Well, now, that's our little secret, isn't it?
I'll walk you out.
Uh, Mr. President, I got this.
Oh, Claire.
Didn't the president make the most wonderful speech?
Oh, he certainly did.
And I thank you for convincing the president
to mention Celia in his remarks.
Well, it was my pleasure.
  Good night.   Good night.
Good night, Claire.
We had a deal.
I showed up.
And used that opportunity to undermine the campaign.
Why didn't you just ask me?
If you needed the clinic to convince Doris  
You don't want me to run, Francis.
That's right, I don't. But we'd reached an understanding.
I think you said what you wanted me to hear.
Well, then you misread me.
I am looking out for myself. Just like you are.
And where did that get you,
looking out for yourself instead of looking out for us?
The th is dead now. You know that.
You think I'm giving up?
What, you're gonna run against the Joneses?
You'll make a fool of yourself, Claire.
The odds were against you even with their blessing.
Now, I hoped you'd reach that conclusion on your own.
But instead, you lied to me.
Now, I can't force you to see reason.
But I will not allow you to become dangerous.
I'll take one.
Take mine.
Claire, look...
When I win the general, then we can concentrate
on a Senate seat for you in Texas.
You don't want to be in the House, anyway.
And neither of us could have predicted a Heather Dunbar,
or how formidable she'd be.
We are fighting for our lives here.
And when you run, you wanna do so from a position of strength.
It's about timing.
Maybe it's too soon. Maybe you're right.
But I need to think.
Fair enough.
I can't do that here.
Back in Texas?
I'm not sure how long I'll need.
Well, take as long as you want.
I should get going.
It's late. You sure you don't want to spend the night?
  Well, Mother was expecting me.   All right.
I'll walk myself out. You enjoy your drink.
You know, there was a boy
that lived down the street from me in Gaffney.
About my age. His name was Walter Wryson.
He used to run away from home all the time and come to our house.
Not for any good reason.
His daddy didn't beat him. He had clothes on his back.
The Wrysons had way more money than we did,
but run away he would,
at least once a month and come straight to our place.
Now, usually, my mother would call his mother
and she'd come and fetch him.
But about the ninth or tenth time this happened,
Walter ran outside, climbed up into a tree in our backyard,
and wouldn't come down for nothing.
Now, my mama said to his mama,
"Why don't you let us keep him for a while,
until he feels like coming home?"
But man, oh, man, that boy was stubborn.
Night came, and he was still up there.
No food, no water... no toilet.
And just before I went to bed,
I looked out my window and I heard him crying.
And I said, "Walter, why don't you come on down?"
And he just shook his head no.
Well, the next morning, I woke up, I looked out the window
and Walter was still up in that tree.
So after breakfast, I walked over with a plate of eggs...
and I asked him if he wanted some.
And again, he just shook his head.
And I got angry.
That boy had a good house, a good family,
the sort I would've killed for,
and he didn't even realize it.
So I went into the tool shed and I took out an ax.
And I said to Walter...
"You want to know what it's really like to live at my house?"
And I gave that tree a good whack.
And Walter cried out, but I kept on.
I mean, you've never heard
screams like the one coming from Walter
as I chopped at that tree.
He pissed his pants,
and it came raining down on the ground,
but I didn't pay it no mind.
I just kept whacking away.
Well...
it didn't take long before Walter was on the ground
and running back to his house.
You see, all he needed was a little motivation.
So I'll give Claire some time.
But for her sake,
I hope she comes out of her tree
before I have to bring out my ax.
He wants me to hold off for Senate.
I told him I would think about it.
  So it's over?   Oh, no, it's not over.
He endorsed Celia on national television.
Forget the th.
We need to think bigger. This cycle.
Then we need to talk seriously about my compensation.
  He on?   Yes, sir.
I'm ready.
I'll connect you now, sir.
President Petrov, you are now on with the president.
Good evening, Mr. President.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Your speech was good.
Perhaps, a bit too...
optimistic, hmm?
I meant what I said about Russia.
It's just words. They mean very little.
I'm willing to back them up with action.
First, we should talk about a bailout.
I'm willing to work with the IMF to get you what you need.
And second, as a gesture of good faith,
we'd like to return Igor Milkin to Russia.
You should've done so already.
I need your assurances he'll get a trial.
  What do you care about Igor Milkin?   I don't.
You can send him to Siberia
and let him die of black lung in a coal mine, for all I care.
But I do care about your economy.
You keep killing high-profile businessmen
and seizing their assets.
  That's no     You mean, traitors?
Look, I am aware that they were plotting a coup,
but that still doesn't  
Yes, because you orchestrated it.
  Excuse me?   Why else would Milkin fly to America?
We had nothing to do with this.
You... you lied to me about the Jordan Valley,
you lied to me about Michael Corrigan.
I am not trying to replace you, Viktor.
I'm trying to help you. But you have to help me.
These threats of reducing your oil production, it won't work.
You think jacking up energy prices is gonna hurt us,
but it's just extortion.
And I will not respond to extortion.
Now, I'll send your traitor back,
but you've got to stop
seizing companies and making people disappear.
Igor Milkin is worse than a traitor. He's an American puppet.
Regime change, that's extortion.
Yes, but they acted on their own. You're being paranoid.
Send him back. No terms.
We're not going to get anywhere if you're not willing to negotiate.
Well...
then I believe we're finished.
And I believe you're right. Thank you, Mr. President.
Put Milkin in a secure location. He's not going anywhere.
Mr. Milkin.
I need you to come with me.
Where are we going?
A detainment facility.
I'm not being deported, am I?
No, we're going to process your asylum request.
Claire?
If you wanna smoke, you should smoke.
I only wanted one drag.
He hated how you used to go down to the stables with your cigarettes.
I didn't realize he knew.
He adored you. You got away with murder.
Did you wait up for me?
No, it's the medication.
Keeps me tired all day, and then I'm up all night.
I... I watched the speech.
What are you gonna do?
It's late, Mother. Let's talk in the morning.
By the way, those earrings are beautiful. I noticed 'em on TV.
They're Francis' mother's earrings.
  They look like they're over a carat.   Two carats.
No doubt she stole them from someone.
The Underwoods never cease to amaze.
Mother...
I'm going to need some money.
For the clinic? Isn't  
A million five for LeAnn and some on top of that.
Well, I thought your campaign was dead.
It is, but I still need her to work for me.
But, what for? I mean, I can't ask my friends for money and  
Our money.
You mean my money.
Don't fight me on this.
Daddy would've done it, no questions asked.
Yes, well... I'm not as foolish as he was.
Well, I'll just have to sell the estate.
You what?
The money is in the trust, but the land is in my name.
  You wouldn't dare.   Well, I'm asking for your help.
  If you refuse to give it     Help?
You didn't lift a finger to help me when I got sick.
You didn't tell me you were sick!
Because you had turned your back on me!
Oh, you are such a disappointment.
You don't want me to sell
this house out from under you, but I will.
I am the mother.
I am the mother!House.of.Cards.SE
John! We're paying you to clean cars,
not read the paper.
Yeah, okay. Sorry.
When I think of the goodness of Jesus
and all that He's done for me,
my soul shouts out, "Hallelujah."
  Hallelujah!   Amen.
That was absolutely beautiful.
You sang it as heavenly and as loudly
as we do in Dallas. Amen!
Amen.
My mother and I are proud to
introduce a man who fought for you in Congress.
He's fighting for you now in the White House.
We wanna help him to stay there.
  Amen.   Amen.
President Frank Underwood!
All right!
Thank you.
You're all wonderful.
Thank you. Please be seated.
You know, it's on a morning like this, in a church like yours,
that I'm very proud to be a South Carolinian.
"How many of you drove to church?
Let me start by asking,
how many of you drove to church here this morning?"
How many of you drove to get to church here this morning?
And how many of you drove together?
Well, I can appreciate that.
Gas prices right now
are putting a strain on everybody's pocketbooks.
Isn't that true?
I think maybe more here in Gaffney,
at least I feel it here in Gaffney more than anywhere else.
"Especially here in Gaffney.
Now, as president, I feel responsible for that.
Or maybe, I feel even more so here.
You know, we've never been a rich town.
You know, a lot of times in my childhood, I thought to myself,
'Why, we just, we were almost like an invisible town to people...
We didn't matter.'"
That we didn't matter.
And, of course, I was a white boy.
And as poor as my family was,
we still were a lot better off than a lot of your families...
who not only had to struggle through poverty
but had to fight racism as well.
Now, how many of you remember ?
"Now, how many of you remember ?
When gas prices were as bad as they are today,
and we had to wait hours just to fill our tank.
Why, OPEC was trying to hold us hostage then
just as Russia's trying to hold us hostage now.
But somehow...
our little community, why, we came together, didn't we?
We came together, didn't we?" Yes.
We looked out for each other. We were there for each other.
Now, maybe we didn't matter to the rest of the country,
but we sure as heck mattered to each other.
We're still struggling with poverty,
and racism is still something we have to fight against.
But I know that this town does matter.
That all of you matter.
And I don't just say that because African Americans
represent half the vote in this state.
I say that because, despite our troubles...
we are one community.
One family.
And that gives us strength.
That strength is a powerful thing.
It's not invisible.
It radiates.
I place my faith in God to give me purpose.
I put my hope in you to give me strength.
Yes, sir.
And come tomorrow, when you vote...
I hope that you will place your trust in me...
...to help continue to lead this country
as we have led this community, together.
Thank you all very much.
Good morning.
I'm LeAnn Harvey, traveling to Washington.
The First Lady isn't here yet, Ms. Harvey,
but you're welcome to board the plane, if you'd like.
Uh, no, I'll wait until she gets here. Thank you.
Aidan.
Hey, I just sent the research.
  What's the gist?   The anger, it's biblical.
  Uh, gas prices?   Yeah, gas is school.
Gas is work.
Gas is the family trip to Disneyland.
Every cent it goes up is another six points on the anger index.
We predict that   a gallon will get you riots.
What about the First Lady?
Oh, she's faring better than he is.
Sympathy for the sick mother.
Thanks for the rush job on this.
Well, you're a friend. And this is far more interesting than...
testing names of anti-depressants for five-year-olds, or...
what color cross trainers soccer moms will drool over.
  I thought you hated politics.   I do.
But anger? And seduction?
Those are interesting.
  Mother, my earrings.   Yes?
You took them.
I did no such thing.
I said I don't...
You're taking my money. I took something of yours.
Claire...
When you leave today, I don't want you coming back.
Oh, I'll come and go as I please, Mother.
This is unreal.
You sure we can count on this guy?
He loathes Francis. That we can count on.
But use your best judgment.
Who compiled this?
An analytics firm I contract with,
one of the best in the country.
They can be trusted?
Yes. I work directly with the owner.
Francis really needs this win in South Carolina.
He sure does.
Let's release more of the strategic reserve.
That might slow down the price inflation, but it won't halt it.
How are you two ladies enjoying those ribs?
Mmm, I'm gonna need a nap after this.
Well, you'll have time.
I have two hours of fundraising calls to make.
It was very nice of you
to let us stay at your house, Mr. President.
Well, that's how we do things here in Gaffney.
Sir?
Listen, I am not gonna negotiate a bailout
if he won't budge on privatization.
If he wants to let his own people starve, so be it.
He may look for relief from Beijing, and that would  
The only thing he hates more than us is China.
He won't kowtow.
But if Petrov does cave to them,
that puts the global energy  
Look, Cathy, I have to call you back.
  When?   About  minutes ago.
  So this will be your box, number .   Thank you.
Would you like to open up a savings account with us?
  Debit card?   No, the box is fine.
Okay.
Would you mind if I...
Oh, sure. I'll give you some privacy.
Thank you.
Good to see you.
You, too, Francis.
I'm surprised.
I don't hear from you, then you just show up.
Mmm, to be honest, I wasn't sure until I landed.
You've gotten some sun.
Tractor-pulling event yesterday. I should've worn a hat.
  Are Doris and Celia here?   They were.
I set up cots for them in the guest room,
but when I heard you were coming, I sent them off to a hotel.
I figured you'd want that room for yourself.
That's very thoughtful.
You have an event now.
Limestone College.
Well, I'll join you.
They'll be there, if you'd rather not see  
It'll be fine.
Unless you'd rather I not go.
No, I'd love you to come.
If he knows I'm involved...
So make sure he doesn't.
Can I see it?
Oh, boy.
Now, this could get interesting.
We need it done by tomorrow morning.
Well, my cousin has a friend, owns an industrial print shop,
but a job that size...
This should cover it.
And then some.
Oh, I didn't know Heather Dunbar had it in her.
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Chase.
Well, are you sure you wouldn't like some iced tea?
Thank you, no. I should get going.
How about some fries with that shake?
Get done what I want done. Don't make me come back here.
  What did Manny say?   I got your shift, bro.
  What about the car?   The Fusion.
I can reset the odometer,
park it in front of your place after work.
But, hey... you gotta get it back by tomorrow night.
  Otherwise, when they do the inventory     I promise you.
All right.
So the cost.
As soon as I get my paycheck, I'll  
No. I don't want money.
Most of the other guys work here, they ain't much to look at.
You?
Keep lookin' over.
Hey, man, listen...
  You want the car or not?   I'll find some other way.
I know about you.
I seen your parole officer come check in on you.
What would he say about you taking one of these cars?
Come on.
Get in.
I just learned today that Limestone College,
founded in ,
was the first women's college in South Carolina,
and one of the first in the nation.
And that's something to be proud of.
And since then, this school and its students have flourished.
A young, eager community
of men and women of all races and backgrounds,
a true reflection of America's future.
How did he convince you to come back?
I convinced myself.
Forty-six years I was married to my husband before he passed.
But if he'd pulled on me what Frank pulled on you,
he would've been long gone.
I think it's worked out for the best.
Your daughter is going to make a fabulous congresswoman.
Well, thank you.
Two minutes.
Now, Frank Underwood understands the need for equality,
in education and throughout our lives.
Most of all, he believes in giving every American
the opportunity to earn a living.
He put this belief into action before and he will again,
and Frank Underwood
will not allow this journey to end with Limestone.
You will go out into this world
and astonish us all with your intellect,
your... your worthiness, and your strength.
Now, I would like to introduce two of the strongest women I know.
Well, don't you look thick as thieves.
...and the First Lady of the United States, Claire Underwood.
It's as though she never left.
And that's what I'm afraid of.
All right, let's hurry on up, now.
Bugayev is telling me that they are willing
to reduce their oil output by
another   by the first of next month.
What are the projections on gas prices?
North of  a barrel for oil.
Six, maybe   a gallon for fuel.
My phone has been ringing off the hook, sir,
from the U.K. to Poland.
The IMF wants to help us
with the debt relief solution.
Sir?
We need to respond to strength with strength.
Well, I don't know how we could be any stronger,
other than to invade Russia.
And what if we do?
  Excuse me, sir?   Not with troops.
With fear.
He's never trusted us.
He already thinks we're behind Milkin's failed coup.
What if we put Milkin in a position to succeed.
Now, I don't care if Milkin actually succeeds.
Unfreeze all his assets. Fly him to a border country.
Put him in a room with other dissidents.
Petrov needs to know that we'll stop at nothing.
Sir, the diplomatic repercussions of such an action  
All I want is the appearance.
Let's look at best and worst case scenarios as soon as possible.
Thank you very much.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were  
That bed was too stiff.
  I'll sleep in there then.   Sleep in here.
We had the mattress on the floor.
What?
That first year, the mattress and those lumpy pillows.
Which you used to steal from me in the middle of the night.
Well, because you would hog all the covers.
God, we were living like heathens.
Well, because we were spending everything we had on the race.
I remember I used to think this place was a palace, though.
  It was.   Not compared to the ranch.
Well, it was a palace because it was ours.
Good night, Francis.
The press has surrounded the house.
I can't leave the damn place
until I know exactly what I'm gonna say.
We need to cancel your events.
Of course we need to cancel my events.
  The expression on my face is a     What's going on?
...taken in a nondescript location,
does not seem to be a direct endorsement for the KKK.
  My God.   My father.
Sir? Congresswoman Jones is heading back to Texas.
Get her on the phone for me, right now.
Meechum, I need you to do me a favor.
There are no clues at the moment
as to who may be responsible,
but Gaffney PD is taking the canvas picture down
within the hour for further examination.
On primary day.
I can't verify anything yet in terms of who it is,
or even whether it's real, or  
The day before New Hampshire, there's a marriage story,
and now in South Carolina we have this?
Uh, how are we getting blindsided?
  I should get that     Let it ring.
Look...
I didn't even know about the fight until you told me.
And how was I supposed to know about this photo?
Because it is your job to get out ahead of this shit.
The oppo team should've tracked this down. That's the campaign.
So, if Vaughn didn't know, or the president didn't tell him...
It has to be somebody close to him. Someone with a lot of access.
The president's on the line.
Sir, it's Doug. I'm in here with Seth.
I'm gonna tell the truth. I'm gonna say it is my father.
That's probably the best response,
if you have a good way to frame it.
I know what to say. The question is where.
One-on-one. Something exclusive.
Not in front of the media.
I need to connect directly to the voters,
the African American voters.
Mr. President, I've got the Secretary of State.
I'll call her back.
Hang on, boys. Meechum?
It's here, sir.
What can you tell me?
Yesterday, a woman named Leslie McIntyre
opened a new box.
I'm having the name run now,
but it looks like she used a fake social.
What about security footage?
They reset the cameras every morning.
I asked what she looked like
and all the manager said is that it was a Caucasian brunette.
Nothing strange about her.
All right. Bring the box back here.
Don't let it out of your sight.
As far as I know, there's only one photograph.
Meechum says it's still at the bank.
Sir, it's just me.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yes, sir.
Well, you keep an eye on him.
I want emails and phone records of everyone in the White House.
Including yours.
Mine? You honestly think  
Is there a problem?
No.
Good.
It's unfortunate.
Ms. Dunbar! Ms. Dunbar? Ms. Dunbar?
The imagery...
That anyone would try to inflame racial discord
by doing something so base.
Whether it's Calvin Underwood isn't the point.
If it is, and we have no confirmation on that,
I mean... Who put this up? And why?
Who knows.
And the sins of the father aren't necessarily the sins of the son.
But... it's troubling. Very troubling.
Stunts like these have the potential to open old wounds.
We can't let that happen. We need to rise above it.
Make clear, no matter who you support,
that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated.
Get me Reverend Clark and Gene Clancy on the phone.
Hey, they want you out by the bus.
By the bus?
  Um, who are you?   Sorry.
Mark from the Butler County office.
They want all the Cincinnati volunteers
to gather by the bus for a photo with Dunbar.
Jenn told me I wasn't supposed to leave  
That's why she sent me.
She didn't want you to miss the photo. Go.
Out by the bus?
She told me to cover for you.
Okay, um...
well, there were a couple of no-shows,
but, you know, otherwise, everyone's here.
  Okay. Thanks.   Very convenient. Thanks.
Enjoy.
I'm David Grimes with the Cleveland Plain Dealer.
Where's your credential?
I was an idiot and left it in the car.
They recognized me at the check-in desk, though.
I can direct you to the bullpen,
but this area is off-limits to the press.
I'm actually supposed to do an interview with Cynthia Driscoll.
The Advance guys said I should come this way.
Wait here.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, we just can't do it.
Forty-five percent of the vote here is African American.
You and your mother standing by my side
would go a long way to put this  
I am running for Congress in a black and Latino district.
My mother was beaten and hosed down in marches.
You want us to vouch for a man whose father was in the KKK?
  No, he was not in the Klan.   That was him in that picture.
Yes, but I've explained that.
This is the state where the Civil War started,
where you can still see rebel flags on bumper stickers.
There is a history of racist brutality here, Mr. President.
Those sort of symbols matter.
Could you put your mother on, please?
Mom?
He wants to speak to you.
Mr. President.
Listen, we need to stand together. Now, I've endorsed Celia.
Claire can do a great deal for her in Texas.
She's better off without the Underwoods at this point.
But what about your clinic?
Imagine how that would look, holding our clinic for ransom.
I'm appealing to your goodwill, Congresswoman.
When we stop getting beaten and shot...
you'll have my goodwill, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Get me Gene Clancy again.
What if it's Oren Chase, Francis?
He could've gotten his hands on a copy.
There may be more than one.
Meechum first, then Clancy.
Lucas?
We need to talk.
  I thought you were     I was. I'm... I'm out now.
This is important.
Mr. President, was your father a racist?
Was your father a racist?
Mrs. Underwood, is your mother okay?
Mr. President!
  Mr. Chase?   Who are you?
United States Secret Service.
We're not after you, Mr. Chase.
We're after whoever put you up to it.
Put me up to what?
You can answer me here,
or we can go to the Columbia field office for questioning.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
All right, I need you to come with me, sir.
  Now, hold on.   Step outside, sir.
I wanna talk to a lawyer.
I need backup at .
  Come on, that's not necessary.   Not if you cooperate, sir.
If I talk to you, I won't get in trouble?
I swear to God, Ms. Dunbar. It's all true.
Then where's the proof?
I don't have the means, but you do.
You've investigated him before. You know he's dangerous.
Mr. Goodwin  
Why would he go after me if I wasn't onto something?
This was a high-level sting operation.
Major resources were dedicated to it.
I'm... I was a journalist, no criminal record.
How am I suddenly such a threat, unless I'm  
Even if I did believe you,
I am no longer part of the DOJ. I am a private citizen now.
Who's running for president  
Aren't you breaking WITSEC protocol by being here?
I am no longer comfortable with this.
You're... you're my last chance. Please!
  I suggest that you go back home.   I'm... The things I've  
  Don't make us get security involved.   Please. Just  
Just give us five minutes until she's out of the building.
Please. Please listen to me.
I'm... I'm begging you.
Just help me...
Help.
Please, please...
Oh, God...
How could you put me in a room with him?
I didn't know what he was gonna say.
But I assumed that if he went to such great lengths  
The DUI, that's all he has proof of. That's nothing.
Even I have helped people get off for that.
  There's the affair...   With no evidence.
Then he leaps to murder... Two murders?
The man is troubled.
We saw the look in his eye.
I thought he might have something real.
He used to be a good editor.
And now he is a convicted felon.
You said no stone unturned.
I'm sorry, I should have thought better of it.
Yes, you should have.
Let's let it go. How are we doing in South Carolina?
Early exit polls are good.
  We have a shot at winning.   Actually winning?
That billboard's done real damage.
I appreciate you doing this, Gene.
You're really saving my life here.
Just remember it when I run for county executive.
I'll be down here whenever you need me.
Oh, it's not the when, it's the what. And how much.
Afternoon, Oren.
  Mr. President.   Have a seat.
Didn't you learn your lesson with all that Peachoid nonsense?
Well, you promised to help me with the th.
I let my bitterness get the better of me.
Who specifically approached you? A woman?
  Brunette?   Yeah.
Uh, about so tall, good-looking.
Wouldn't give me her name.
We should get photos
of everyone in Dunbar's staff that fits that description.
Already compiling it, ma'am.
And as for you...
you're gonna plant yourself in front of as many TV cameras
that can gather around that bony ass of yours.
You're gonna be wracked with guilt and overcome with conscience.
And you do that and I'll make sure that you aren't charged.
You want me to say it was Dunbar?
Come on, be smarter than that, Oren. She'll sue you for slander.
Just say you were bought
and people will connect the dots on their own.
Get him out of here.
I hope you don't Welsh on
your promise to me the way you did with Oren.
You're family, Gene. I would never betray one of the family.
Shall we?
Ready?
Many of you voted for me for mayor
because you've known me your whole lives.
Well, I've known Frank Underwood my whole life.
He's my friend and I trust him,
and I don't care what's on that billboard.
I'm proud he's my president,
and I'm proud to have... be standing with him here today.
Thank you, Gene.
Yesterday, I stood in this church...
and I talked about community.
I talked about our collective strength,
black and white, coming together during times of crisis.
And today there's probably a lot of you who think I'm a hypocrite.
How can a man whose father was in the KKK stand up here
and mean the things he said?
Yes, that is my father in that photograph,
I'm not going to deny it.
But the truth is he wasn't in the Klan.
The year that photo was taken,
my father needed  , to pay off our debts,
or the bank was gonna foreclose on our farm.
Now, my father went to every other bank
within a hundred miles of here,
and no one would give him a loan.
He asked friends, he asked family,
but nobody had that kind of money.
And we were about to lose everything.
Now, at the time, the owner of the Gaffney First Bank
was a member of the Klan.
Some of you know that.
And he would do whatever the Klan told him to do,
and my father knew that.
So my father did what he had to do.
He went to a meeting and begged the leader of that chapter
to talk to the owner of the bank.
And at that meeting, that's when that photograph was taken.
The only reason he was there was to try to save our farm.
Now, Calvin Underwood hated himself for going to that meeting.
He hated himself for taking that photograph.
But he would've hated himself even more if he'd lost our farm...
if he hadn't been able to provide and support his family.
Now, look, I'm not trying to ask you to forgive him
being in that photograph.
He probably thought no one would ever see it.
But I am asking you to empathize with his predicament.
And ask yourselves...
what would you do to save your family?
Now, whoever stole that photograph and vandalized that billboard,
they're not trying to unearth some big scandal about my past,
'cause it just isn't true.
What they're trying to do is divide us.
What they really wanna succeed in doing
is making sure you don't vote for me today.
They've gone to a whole
lot of trouble to make me look pretty bad.
But that's politics.
My hope in coming here today...
and speaking openly and honestly about this...
is that we can stay united.
So my plan is to stay here as long as it takes,
to speak to each one of you individually,
and answer every question that you might have.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
President Underwood,
speaking live in his home town of Gaffney, South Carolina,
addressing claims that
his father was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.
A billboard there was vandalized late last night
with a photo of his father standing
next to a man in Klan robes
with the caption, "Underwood ."
As we've just seen, the president did not deny allegations
that his father had some connection to the organization,
instead explaining that Calvin Underwood attended one meeting
as a last resort
to save his family's peach farm from foreclosure.
The president was subject to widespread criticism
after news of his family's
alleged Klan connection broke this morning.
Today's primary result will show  
I don't know her name. I asked, but she wouldn't tell me.
And I deeply regret
that I allowed my political leanings to compromise my better judgment.
I want to apologize to anyone I might have offended
by hoisting up such painful imagery.
We're getting calls asking if it was us.
  Do you think someone from our team     Absolutely not.
I think Underwood put this guy up to it.
He's trying to turn this back around on us.
We need to deny, forcefully.
I'm already putting a press avail together at your next event.
Maybe we need to reconsider Goodwin.
  What do you have in mind?   I'm not sure.
Look at this.
It came from the goddamn White House!
We're questioning the photographer now, sir.
I've got a statement prepared that
this was a run-of-the-mill event,
that you took photos with lots of re-enactors.
It doesn't matter how you spin it.
I just stood in front of
a group of African Americans in a church
asking them to believe in me.
It's bad enough they see my father next to a Klansman.
Now they see me next to a symbol of slavery.
I wanna find out who's leaking this shit,
and I want their head on a goddamn stake!
Sir, I have a theory.
I think...
Well, I think it might be Edward Meechum.
Meechum?
He knew about the argument between you and the First Lady.
He was there on that trip to Virginia.
He would never do something like this.
Dunbar has a lot of money.
Put out a statement to the networks
that I won't be giving a concession speech.
Sir... don't you think that might look like you're running from  
I just lost my home state.
I'm not gonna rake myself over the coals.
Meechum?
I'm not ruling anyone out.
Sir?
I brought the safety deposit box for you.
You can put it down.
  Meechum.   Yes, sir?
Have I given you any reason to hurt me?
Hurt you, sir?
Have I done you wrong in any way?
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.
Look me in the eyes, Meechum.
  Sir...   Meechum, shh.
Are you all right, sir?
I've been better.
I'm still on duty.
Is there...
anything I can do?
You could go out and stuff some ballot boxes for me.
  You'll bounce back from this.   I sure hope I can.
Uh, when I got fired...
from the Capitol Police...
I mean, I know it doesn't compare, but...
I felt pretty bad.
I thought my career was over.
Then you turned everything around.
You don't get second chances in elections.
I know.
But there's a lot of primaries ahead.
All I'm saying is it's not over. You'll get through this.
  I'm sorry, that must sound so stupid.   No, it doesn't.
I appreciate it.
I'll be out by the motorcade, sir, if you need anything.
Thank you, Meechum.
I knew it, but I didn't wanna believe it.
It's only a wound.
It's not fatal.
My home state, Claire.
Have a seat.
I end your race so you end mine?
  Let me explain, Francis.   Spite, revenge!
Please, sit down. We need to talk.
Nothing is going to come from anger right now.
Last night when we were talking, you called this house a palace.
This is where we began.
And do you remember when my mother almost left Daddy
because he funded your campaign?
That's how much she hated you.
But I didn't care,
because I saw something. I saw a future.
Our future.
We had a future until you started destroying it.
Well, you wouldn't have listened otherwise.
I always listen to you.
Only when it's what you want to hear.
Well, all right, Claire. I'm listening now.
What is it you so desperately needed to say?
We've never lost a race in  years.
We started here and we've always won.
You and I, together.
But you are losing, Francis.
People are getting killed at the gas pumps.
America Works is falling flat.
Your campaign manager is ten years behind ten years ago.
You don't have a viable running mate.
We both know it can't be Donald Blythe.
Well, of course not.
But I have to win the goddamn nomination
  before I can start worrying about winning.   Even if I hadn't done what I did,
your race is in real trouble.
You need me, Francis.
My approvals are higher than yours.
I can help you win Texas.
Exactly. Which is why I didn't want you running in Dallas.
I need you at my side.
Yes, but in a different way.
Different how?
We make each other stronger, can we agree to that?
When it's working, but it's not working.
We can make it work.
We can accomplish that future I saw when we first got married.
It was us, as partners, real partners.
Let's run together, again.
Not just as husband and wife.
You don't mean...
Yes.
I'm worried about you, Claire.
You're not making any sense. You've let your ego get in the way  
I've always been your running mate.
  You just didn't wanna see it.   As my vice president?
  Jesus. Do you have any idea     I've put a lot of thought into this.
You can't have thought it through.
  Because if you did, you'd come up   She has no experience.
  with a million reasons     She's never run for anything.
No children, nepotism, arrogance, I've run through them all.
You can't win without me.
I would rather have a spineless Donald Blythe as my vice president
than a woman who's never held elected office.
You're losing to a woman who's never held elected office.
You don't deserve it.
You have no idea what it means to have nothing.
You don't value what we have achieved.
I have had to fight for everything my entire life.
Do you know why I kept this?
Do you know?
Because it's the one time I was proud of my father.
Because this man, in this moment, as despicable as it was,
is fighting to survive.
He is doing whatever it took.
And so will I, with or without you.
So no, I will not have this conversation.
I will not indulge you any further.
You have to let this go.
I can be a part of your campaign, or I can end it.
I'll do whatever it takes, too. Just like your father.
But I will not let this go.
I'll need a car to the Greenville Airport.
To Dallas, yes.House.of.Cards.SE
Less than   are comfortable
with a president and a vice president being related in any way.
Less than   approve of someone who's never held elected office.
But if we can move the needle...
Forty points?
It's how we frame it.
Her favorables are decent. They're better than mine.
In a void, but when it comes to her time as the UN ambassador,
they fall off a cliff.
Performance and experience are big factors.
Then we have to amplify her strengths, not her weaknesses.
We're looking for a VP who's an asset.
This research proves she isn't.
Your job is not to dissuade me, but to figure out how we sell it.
Sir, there are so many people to choose from.
If the goal is to win,
  and we're bending over backwards    Seth.
The president asked us to develop a plan,
so that's what we'll do.
I'll meet you in my office.
  You know he's right.   Well, of course he's right.
Maybe we offer something else.
She won't listen.
What about LeAnn?
Yes, I was thinking that, too.
Question is how to co-opt her.
She likes paychecks.
No, it's gotta be more than money. She wants coattails.
We swap Claire's for mine.
  Campaign manager?   We could use some fresh blood.
That I agree with, but LeAnn?
I mean, there's no guarantee that we can control her.
Yeah, but if she can convince Claire to change her mind,
that's all I need.
Yes.
They're ready for you in the Situation Room, sir.
I'll be right there.
You could work with her if you had to.
I don't have to like her to work with her.
  Good, make the call.   You still want Seth on the plan?
Yes, until LeAnn's on board. Do I have to worry about him?
We dug pretty deep. Nothing in his emails or phone records.
He's smart enough to cover his tracks.
I'll talk to him.
  What do you think of this painting?   I'm not sure.
Walker and I sat here one night, stared up at a painting,
the blue one that's in the Oval now.
They replaced it with this.
That's not the American flag.
No, it's the rebel flag...
sinking into oblivion.
Is that a lightning bolt?
Oh, I assume...
Unless it's just a bad attempt at making the ship a unicorn.
Do you see that?
Colors are nice.
I hate it.
I guess I hate it, too.
I suppose it's not a good idea to have
the Confederate flag hanging here in the White House
after everything that's happened in South Carolina.
Even if it is sinking.
What do you think we should put up?
I don't know. Something you like better.
Do you have that marker I sign things with?
Put your hand up on the wall.
  Sir?   Put it on the wall.
Spread your fingers a little bit.
Wait. Okay.
Yeah... That's enough fun for today.  
Doug, I don't know how to do what he's asking me to do.
  There is not some magical     The leaks.
  Was it you?   Are you serious?
Very.
I handed over all of my correspondence, just like everyone else.
Doesn't prove anything.
I'm trying to save this campaign.
If I wanted to sabotage it, I'd let the president do it himself,
instead of fighting back on this VP thing.
Or that's just a cover.
I've been in the trenches for the past year
while you've been gone, and now you doubt me?
I don't need this.
You got this job by digging up dirt.
If you can't trust me by now,
I don't know what I'm doing here.
Are you saying you wanna resign?
That is the last thing that I want,
but you're not giving me any incentive to stay.
All right. Fuck it.
Seth, I'm choosing to believe you right now,
but if I come to regret that decision  
You won't, because it's not me.
I still think it could be Meechum.
It wasn't.
  You're sure?   I'm positive.
And so is the president.
May I go?
Or did you want to discuss the plan for the First Lady?
I have some calls to make. I'll come to your office after.
Get me LeAnn Harvey.
Milkin will be staying with this man, Anton Khalski.
He owned the second-largest
bank in Russia until Petrov seized it in .
Khalski fled across the border to Estonia.
We'll have Milkin's plane fly to Tallinn,
then he'll travel by boat to Khalski's summer house on Saaremaa.
Tomorrow we'll unfreeze Milkin's American assets
and transfer them to Khalski's Swiss accounts.
Khalski will reach out to his Russian military friends
and then start buying them off.
Are the FSB monitoring Khalski?
Closely. They'll know we're behind this.
  When Moscow confronts us?   We'll deny, of course.
Are we prepared if Petrov overreacts?
The Sixth Fleet has a presence near the Bosphorus,
we have patrols in the North Sea.
  Draft the order.   Sir, if I may?
  Yeah, we've discussed this, Cathy.   Yes, sir.
I feel obligated
to raise my very strong objections. The diplomatic cost to us  
If diplomacy were working,
we wouldn't have to consider this course of action, would we?
  I've voiced my concerns.   Thank you, everyone.
You're not going to surprise me
by putting the president on, are you?
No, it's just us. He filled me in, though,
  on the First Lady's request.   And?
We wanna make you campaign manager.
Look at your email.
  What is this?   Our research.
It all boils down to the same thing.
You ran a few polls, so what?
  Focus groups, too.   Meaningless.
Not these numbers.
Claire can't be on the ticket. You know she can't.
This isn't something you can isolate on its own.
If gas prices hit   a gallon, you're fucked.
  You lose every key demo.   We're well aware.
But if the president makes Claire his running mate,
it makes the conversation tactical instead of economic.
That buys you time on the Russia crisis.
You solve that, confidence in the president
translates into confidence in his choice  
I didn't call you to be convinced. I called to offer you a job.
  Only to get to Mrs. Underwood.  This isn't just about her.
We need you. You'll turn this campaign around.
I'm surprised, Doug. I didn't think you were very fond of me.
I'm fond of talent. So is the president.
My loyalty is to the First Lady.
All I'm asking is that you talk to her.
I'll tell you what. I'll show Claire your research
if you show the president mine.
I can agree to that.
I shouldn't even be talking to you, Heather.
I'm seriously concerned that there's been an abuse of power.
Madam Attorney General? Mr. Stamper, um, is ready to see you now.
I'll be right there.
I gotta go.
The agent in charge of the operation
got a promotion directly after.
  Listen     Martha, if the president,
or one of his staff... If anyone strong-armed the bureau
into pursuing Lucas Goodwin,
then you know that's an abuse of power.
I work for the president.
I am about to sit down with his Chief of Staff.
  The law is the law.   This is politics, not the law.
Not true. You brought me on
as solicitor general because of my integrity.
I am bringing this to you because of yours.
Madam Attorney General.
I really need to go.
If a sliver of Goodwin's story holds up...
How did you even find this?
Did your oppo team speak to someone in WITSEC?
Because if that's the case, then that sort of breach is not  
  I spoke to him myself, personally.   You what?
He came to me. He tracked me down.
I'm not touching this, Heather.
Doug, sorry about that.
  No     I was just on with the Chief Justice.
  Don't be silly, come on in.   Thank you.
  This way.   Thanks so much.
I don't know. She didn't do that well as ambassador.
She wasn't experienced enough.
Hold on, she was an ambassador?
  At the United Nations.   Chris, don't you watch the news?
How many of you feel the same?
Any other reasons, besides lack of experience?
Well, she was really impulsive when she had that outburst in Moscow.
Well, she never should've been there in the first place.
I mean, the Senate voted her down,
and then her husband just appoints her?
That's not right.
Okay, see, I like her as a person, but I agree,
she should stick to being First Lady.
So, he's hoping you'll convince me to let it go.
Look, I'd make a killing compared to what you've paid me,
but you and I talked about making a real mark.
My father really liked Francis.
But as my daddy, he said to me, the day before we got married,
"You have one life, Claire.
Are you sure this is the man you wanna spend it with?"
What did you say?
I said I didn't want to live my life full of doubts.
Well, I think Francis wants me to doubt myself.
  What was that?   My mother... killing a lizard.
  I'll get the door for you, ma'am.   I can open the door myself.
Watch your step. There's blood on the floor.
I want you to take this to the president, in person.
  Try to get on a plane tonight if you can.   Of course.
This one's for you.
  It's warm.   At least it's free.
I may need to cash in my insurance.
What's going on?
Tell me what my position would be if she wins the nomination.
Is it the attorney general?
  The what?   Never mind.
For running mate?
It's way too early for running mates. He hasn't even won.
  Are we talking about the same thing?   You go first.
It doesn't work that way.
Well, you're the one looking for a job.
You can either involve me,
or you can start reading
headlines about Dunbar pushing a marriage story.
That would blow you up.
Doug's already suspicious. I've got nothing to lose.
So which is it?
Lucas Goodwin.
He was an editor... at The Herald, the one who  
  We spoke to him.   Isn't he in prison?
Not anymore.
He's scheduled to depart at  hours.
That'll put him in Tallinn shortly before dawn.
Our station chief is standing by with the escort to Saaremaa.
This is the executive order.
  Sir     Cathy, I've made my decision.
  Hourly updates once he lands.   Yes, sir.
Thank you all very much.
Tell Doug I'm ready.
Please, have a seat, LeAnn.
I'm delighted you've agreed to come on board.
It's my understanding there is a condition attached.
Well, yes.
And she understands that condition? You've spoken with her?
Oh, my apologies, sir. I wasn't clear.
I meant our condition, not yours.
On Super Tuesday.
It's a long trip to deliver this in person.
Well, it's not the sort of thing
you'd want to end up in the wrong hands.
Are you staying here in Washington?
No, I'm going straight back.
Is there anything you'd like me to tell the First Lady?
Tell her she'll have her answer by this evening.
  Thank you, Mr. President.   Have a safe trip back, Ms. Harvey.
I'll show myself out.
For quite some time, the president and I have been growing apart.
Have Meechum step in here.
We've attempted to save our marriage,
but after great effort, I've come to the conclusion
that it can't be saved.
It is with great regret that I announce today
I'm filing for divorce.
  We have to stop her.   Before she gets to the airport?
No, I mean Claire.
You asked for me, sir?
Come in.
Both the cell and the landline  
We're on lockdown, ma'am. We had to scramble all the  
Lockdown? What are you talking about?
I'm gonna need you to stay in the house.
  What     I'm sorry, ma'am.
You can't force me to stay in here.
There is a current, highly credible threat to your life  
I need to speak to your supervising  
I am the head of your detail here in Dallas, ma'am,
and I've been ordered to keep you securely in this house.
Go Underwood!
  Listen.   Blunderwood! Blunderwood!
Do you know what they're chanting? "Blunderwood."
And if I were their English professor,
why, I would give them all an "A" for cleverness...
...but a "D" for accuracy.
But that's part of being president.
You make enemies,
and you can hear some of mine just outside, right now.
So, I am grateful to each and every one of you
for coming out and showing your support today.
It's because of you we will win this nomination,
and that's why I came to your college today.
Now, of course, I knew
that there would be protesters here today...
and I could've chosen not to come,
or I could choose to avoid them as I leave,
but I'm not going to do that,
because those students out there, your fellow classmates,
I'm their president, too.
And whether they vote for me or not, I have to lead them as well.
So, it's important to hear them, to talk to them,
to listen to their ideas,
because, just as you're learning in college,
a diversity of ideas makes us all wiser,
and that holds true even for your president.
True leadership
is not running away from those who disagree with you,
but embracing them,
and that is exactly what I intend to do when I'm done today.
I'm gonna go out and embrace that entire crowd.
Shouldn't we be taking a military plane?
That would draw attention.
Relax.
Everything's been worked out. You're in good hands.
Here, get some sleep.
It's gonna be a long trip tonight.
Blunderwood! Blunderwood!
  Any news?   Everything's secure, sir.
We love you, Underwood!
Thank you all for coming out,
even those of you who don't entirely support me.
  Way to go, Mr. President!   Thank you.
I wanna try to hear what it is that you disagree with me about.
I understand not everyone's for me.
  No more wars!   Go back to Gaffney!
Hello, how are you? Thank you for coming out.
Hello, thank you for coming out.
  You're doing a great job!   We know what you are!
Hello.
All right, I'm here to try to listen to you,
but probably one at a time is gonna be a little better.
Okay, maybe we could have a conversation, more one-on-one.
It's difficult to hear you.
I understand what you don't believe in, but what are you for?
That would be a good question. All right, how about you?
You've been yelling at me for a little while.
What do you think I should be doing differently?
  You should resign.   Well, now,
I'm not asking for your vote,
but what would you do if you were president?
You're ruining our country!
I came out here to try to listen to what you wanna say,
but if all you're gonna do is scream  
Gun!
Let's go! Let's go!
Move! Move! Go, go, go!
There has been an attempted assassination of the president.
President Frank Underwood has been shot.
It occurred about ten minutes ago during a campaign event
at Hammond University in Washington, D.C.
We do not yet know how severely the president has been wounded.
He is en route to Jefferson Memorial Hospital.
We don't know how serious his condition may be.
Footage of the assassination attempt is still making its way to us,
and we expect to have that shortly.
Witnesses are reporting
that there was a quick succession of gunshots,
four or five,
a lone gunman whose identity we are still trying to determine.
We've been told the gunman was killed,
as well as at least one Secret Service agent,
but we don't have definitive confirmation of that yet.
We don't yet know who the gunman may be or who the agent is.
  What's happened?   The president's been shot.
I'm hearing now that the president
received at least one gunshot to the abdomen, possibly more,
that he clutched his stomach,
that he fell instantly to the ground,
and there were screams, people panicking,
that it has been very chaotic at that scene.
We have very little information at this time,
other than shots were fired, the president wounded.
But as I say, he is alive.
We've gotten no official
statement from the White House as of yet,
either the president's precise condition
or the whereabouts of Vice President Blythe.
He is believed to be at the White House. We cannot confirm that,
nor do we know if he will take over as acting president,
assuming the duties of the presidency
under the terms of the th Amendment to the Constitution.
That would seem likely, however,
if the president's wounds are as serious
as we believe them to be.
This is a difficult moment for the country.
It is not the first time that a president has been shot
in my lifetime or in many of yours.
But even for those of us who have experienced this before,
it is no less of a shock, it is no less terrifying.
It is the moment when our nation's resilience,
when our collective strength,
the moment when all of that is tested the most.
And we can only imagine
how difficult it must be for the First Lady.
  Francis     Michael told me.
I have to go back to Washington.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Do you expect me to console you?
No, I just...
  Goodbye, Mother.   Claire.
I hope he dies.
Claire, I can't imagine how difficult this must be.
Is there anything I can do?
I appreciate the call, Mr. Vice President,
but I'm sure you've got a lot to take care of right now.
Is there anything I can do to help you?
I'll be making a brief appearance
once we have a better sense of... where things stand.
Would you like me to be there?
I think it would be good, the country seeing the First Lady.
I think it's more important that they see your steady hand.
If you're by my side, it would certainly make it steadier.
Of course. Anything you ask.
I'm gonna be praying for you. For both of you.
Thank you, Don.
Okay.
This way, sir.
Thank you, sir.
The acting president needs
to be briefed on a highly classified matter.
Everyone without military clearance, we'll need the room.
It was in fact two shots.
One that grazed the torso just beneath the right arm
and the second which entered the abdomen,
possibly into his liver.
Obviously, it was that shot that did the greatest damage.
The president is currently reported to be in critical condition.
The Secret Service agent
that was killed protecting the president was Edward Meechum.
He is the head of the president's detail,
and we can confirm that now.
After being shot and before he died,
he killed the assailant whose identity is still unknown.
We're waiting now on a press conference from the White House
from Press Secretary Seth Grayson,
and we expect to have that beginning in just a few moments.
We confirm nothing unless you run it past me twice first,
  I don't want     Mr. Grayson...
I'm on my way. We don't want any rumors, only facts.
There's a student who's claiming it was the Secret Service
  who fired the first shot.   What did I just say?
  Do not waste my time with that bullshit.   Sir,
the press is waiting.
All right, I'm... I'm coming. Uh, where's my...
this afternoon, Vice President Donald Blythe
was authorized as acting president by the cabinet.
He is currently meeting with them.
Approximately  minutes ago, the First Lady landed at Andrews.
She is expected to arrive at the hospital shortly.
  Mrs. Underwood.   How is he?
They're still in the OR. Probably a few hours left to go.
Is he going to live?
He took a direct hit to his liver, which is partially shattered.
Fortunately, part of the left lobe is mostly intact.
Now, we think there's a decent chance he will survive surgery,
but even if he does, that's when the real fight begins.
I'd like to see him.
As soon as he's out, I'll make sure you know.
Okay, thank you.
I'd recommend we call off this operation,
we turn the plane around now.
I disagree. It's well planned.
The president already signed off.
The president might die.
  Madam Secretary...   We'll have no talk like that, Cathy.
My apologies, sir.
What I am trying to say is that
it is too risky to antagonize  
The point was to scare them, not  
To do anything of this nature
while the commander in chief is incapacitated,
  the Russians will take advantage     We're at high alert.
We're prepared for all eventualities.
We don't want the military to be the fail-safe here.
Mr. Vice... Mr. President...
I believe it is our duty to carry out the orders
that the president signed.
  The circumstances have changed.   The plan is sound.
So, what would you like to do, sir,
continue the mission or abort?
Uh, I... I wanna think on it.
He's scheduled to land in two hours.
I just want...
I've gotta think. Let's take a break.
I, uh, I need to process all this.
Sir?
The president weighed everything  
Cathy brought up some good points.
She's been against this from the very beginning,
but the president clearly  
Just give me some time, Doug, please?
I've got too many people barking in my ear.
The president is out of surgery,
and he is in stable but critical condition.
Excuse me! Excuse me! We are going to keep this orderly.
Dr. Saxon will finish his statement,
and then we'll answer your questions. Thank you.
The surgery lasted six hours,  minutes.
Three quarters of his liver was removed.
A liver, even one quarter of a liver,
has the ability to regenerate within six to eight weeks.
We will be conducting blood tests every hour.
Enzymes, ammonia levels, PT times,
I believe these are all explained in the handout.
...the medical report, live from the White House,
which we will return to shortly.
But we have breaking news we're following.
The would-be assassin was previously reported
as John Carlyle from Dayton, Ohio,
but sources in the Department of Justice now say
this was actually an alias for Lucas Goodwin,
a former editor at The Washington Herald
who was convicted of cyberterrorism nearly two years ago.
Now, if we freeze this cell phone footage of the shooting
and we compare the shooter's face to this picture of Goodwin...
well, the comparison is striking
and would seem to confirm
what we're hearing from our sources in the DOJ,
who say Goodwin was recently released
and is in a witness protection program.
It's so strange to think that I  
It was, what? Just two hours before? Less than.
How did he react?
He was cold, I guess. I couldn't really read him.
He looks so weak.
Should I come back to Washington?
Let's see how the next couple of days go.
Well, just say the word, I'm on a plane.
All right, thank you, LeAnn. Good night.
Good night.
Francis, can you hear me?
Francis.
I just spoke to Eddie's parents, ma'am.
You said you wanted to call them?
Yes, thank you.
Edward was more than a hero, Mrs. Meechum.
He was our friend.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Please, let me know if there's anything
I can do for you and your family.
You can call me anytime.
Yes, ma'am, that is my private number.
And again, I'm so sorry.
  Lucas Goodwin?   We didn't know he was out.
How can that happen? He's released and you didn't know  
Ma'am... as far as threats go,
we've been far more occupied with you lately.
I'm hoping that we can work together, because I need your help.
  How?   The vice president.
We spoke. I told him I would appear with him.
Not the statement.
He's having trouble making a decision.
Can you come back to the White House with me?
It's serious, ma'am.
I can fill you in on the way.
I'll grab my things.
I can't let you go any farther, sir.
I'm his Chief of Staff.
I'm sorry, sir.
Only doctors and the First Lady for now.
Claire.
Hello.
How are you?
  Exhausted.   I'm sure.
You must be, too.
There's so much I don't know. It's... overwhelming.
Sir, I briefed the First Lady on the Milkin operation.
I thought she might have some insight,
given her experience working directly with Russia.
I know you've had a lot of people weigh in already.
I value your input, Claire. I'm glad you're here.
  Douglas, will you give us a minute?   Of course.
I'll be with the cabinet, sir.
You know that thing that people say,
"God never gives you more than you can handle"?
Yes.
My Marjory, God bless her,
she said that was pure bullshit.
Oh, listen to me complaining
while your husband is fighting for his life.
Oh, it's okay. Actually, I need the distraction.
Let's talk Russia.
I'm torn. Uh, we have this plane circling over the North Sea...
  and I don't know what to do.   Well, what does your gut tell you?
I've never been a gut sort of guy.
I mean, if I had a gun to my head...
  Sorry, that was a poor choice of words.   It's fine. Go on.
I understand what the president hoped to achieve,
but the thought of provoking Russia...
And I'm just beginning to immerse myself in all the complexities.
What would Frank do, if he were in my shoes right now?
If he were here, he'd tell you
that's the last thing you should think about,
because he's not here, you are.
What would you do?
Proceed with the mission or bring him back?
I don't like either.
Those are my options.
Well, if there's one thing I've learned,  years with Francis,
and he said it time and time again,
"If you don't like the way the table is set..."
  "Then turn over the table."   That's right.
He's said it to me, more than once.
Then that's what you should do, Donald.
  But how?   Well, let's figure it out.
Weren't we supposed to have landed already?
  We're in a holding pattern.   Why? Is something wrong?
All I know is we're in a holding pattern.
Doug.
This plane's gonna run out of fuel soon.
We're gonna have to put it down somewhere.
I'll be making a statement shortly. Let's notify the press corps.
  About the operation?   No, to reassure the American people.
  Shall I meet you in there?   Ten minutes.
The cabinet?
  Still waiting on your decision, sir.   Good.
Let's go.
I want you to land the plane in China.
China, sir?
There's no bailout without Chinese money.
We give them Milkin, they have more leverage.
Sir, that gives away our leverage.
I'm not for regime change, but that just...
It's the last thing that Petrov is expecting.
They'll demand drilling access in eastern Siberia.
And when they do, we become the lesser of two evils.
Sir, at no time did the president
intend on bringing China into the mix...
Get the plane on Chinese soil.
And turn over Milkin's assets. That's my decision.
  I asked for your help.   And that's what I gave.
No, China wasn't part of the president's plan.
It's part of the acting president's plan.
  You ready?   Yes, whenever you are.
  Seth?   Yes, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen, the acting president.
Please, sit.
This is a difficult day for all Americans,
particularly for Mrs. Underwood,
who is gracious enough to be here,
to lend me strength while I address an anxious nation.
Mr. President!House.of.Cards.SE
Lucas Goodwin was released from a federal detention center
in Terre Haute, Indiana, two months ago.
FBI investigators searched his witness protection residence
  in Dayton, Ohio...   Why was he even out of jail?
He helped the DOJ with an ongoing investigation.
How did you not know that?
WITSEC. Only need-to-know for security reasons.
We found this today at his house.
A suicide note, I guess.
This can't go public.
We haven't told the press anything.
But this is evidence.
Once the report comes out...
Email this to me.
Mrs. Underwood?
It's two o'clock in the morning. Would you like to go home?
Oh, yes, I'll be out in a moment.
Yes, ma'am.
His liver is just not regenerating fast enough.
What does that mean, exactly?
He needs a transplant, or he'll die.
  How soon?   Days.
We've made him Status .
I'm optimistic we'll find him a suitable liver.
The recipient list is classified.
You're the only two members of the administration
who've been briefed.
Is the First Lady aware?
Yes, I informed her this afternoon.
May I?
Please.
I know it's late, but they said you were up, so...
No, I know. I just hadn't eaten all day.
I'm sure you haven't.
  Would you like some salad?   Sure. Thank you.
It's scary, about Frank.
Well, Francis is a fighter.
I wish I could ask his advice.
I have my call with Petrov in the morning.
I feel good about my understanding of the plan.
My concern is him railroading me on the call.
Well, would you like me to be on it?
An extra set of ears.
I don't... I don't know how Cathy would feel about that.
Well, she doesn't need to know.
I could just listen from up here.
And maybe I could type a note if you get into trouble.
...tight-lipped on the president's recovery.
As of now, he's reported to be in stable condition.
No press has been allowed into the hospital.
Republican presidential hopeful Will Conway
spoke of the president at a rally in Arizona this morning.
I've criticized President Underwood often.
But right now, he's our president...
Come back tomorrow. We're all out.
...and we have to pull together, both sides of the aisle...
We're all out for today.
Sorry, come back tomorrow.
  We're all out, guys. We're all out.   Are you serious?
Come back tomorrow. We're all out for today, sir.
Bullshit!
Can I siphon a couple of gallons from you?
Fifty bucks. I'm running on fumes.
I gotta get my kids to school, and my husband to work  
Eighty bucks, two gallons.
Sorry, I can't help you. Sorry.
The line's open?
Moscow is ready when you are, sir.
You can set it up here.
My Cliff Notes.
I'm ready.
Mr. President, you're on with President Petrov.
Mr. President.
All of Russia is praying for the president's recovery.
I hope you will extend my warm thoughts to Mrs. Underwood.
I certainly will.
You're a brave man
to take over during such difficult times.
I just want to make sure
we find a manageable resolution to this oil  
I've read some of your books, Mr. President.
I just finished Learning to Learn.
It was good.
Thank you.
There was a chapter on visualization that really interested me.
Yes, it's a... A tool for students. It helps them  
I would like you to visualize something.
Now, you're standing in the tundra.
Um, wind, snow...
machines drilling through the ice,
long pipelines stretching to the horizon. Do you see?
If you want to talk about Siberia, I'm more than happy to  
No, no, no. You're not visualizing,
Mr. Vice President.
Close your eyes.
All right. They're closed.
Good. Now...
picture the men
working those drills and pipelines.
What do they look like?
Um, heavy coats, gloves, boots.
Are they... Chinese?
You see, when I picture this,
I don't see Chinese.
I agree with you. The less control the Chinese have, the better.
Then why did you send Milkin to China?
You weren't negotiating with us.
We thought they might have more luck.
Their demands would leave us worse off than we were before.
I can get the IMF to provide half the bailout.
This would counteract the Chinese demands for drilling rights  
You are playing us off each other.
Mr. President  
I think you're in over your head, Mr. Blythe.
If you would just give me a chance to elaborate  
Why give you a chance?
What do you know about Russia? About China?
I've been briefed on  
Forgive me, but, uh...
I don't feel comfortable
negotiating with anyone other than the president.
When he recovers, perhaps he and I can speak.
So, are we finished?
The president's in very bad shape.
Sir...
How serious is it?
He needs a liver transplant.
I wasn't aware that...
You better get used to negotiating with me.
If the president dies, it's you and I...
or nothing at all.
My apologies, Mr. President.
I didn't intend to insult you.
Let's keep a dialogue open. That's all I'm asking.
I'd like the opportunity to present you with a detailed proposal
countering the Chinese demands.
I'll have Secretary Durant work with your foreign minister,
and then we'll take it from there.
Are you open to that?
Of course.
I look forward to reviewing your proposal.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Sir, we didn't want that to get out to the press yet.
The American people deserve to know, anyway.
Sir, the Russians don't respond well to weakness.
Now that they know that the president  
You heard him say he's open to negotiation.
I'd say that's progress.
Four days and still nothing?
No press conference, no briefing.
We have to let them conduct
their investigation on their own terms.
Feels like we're being shut out.
This isn't just the bureau.
They have to coordinate with Homeland
  and make sure nothing sensitive     That's bullshit.
There's something about Goodwin that you don't want us to know.
Wrong.
I wanna know why he did this just as much as you do...
But we've gotta let the FBI do its job.
Same theory as when I visited him.
And that was before he struck the plea, correct?
I encouraged him to plead guilty.
His claims were unsubstantiated.
Tell us about your meeting with the president
prior to that meeting with Goodwin.
Lucas asked me to investigate. I did.
That involved an interview with Underwood.
You still have your notes?
No notes without a warrant.
The press. Calling non-stop.
We suggest you don't speak to anyone while we're still  
Don't worry. I don't have any interest in getting dragged into this.
Let me go dig up those notes.
Blythe... He told Petrov the president needs a transplant.
Why would he do that?
Petrov got under his skin.
This is why we should've carried out your husband's plan.
We're giving Moscow too much room to maneuver  
Let's not debate what we can't change, Doug.
If Moscow knows, we'll have to notify the press.
We're doing that tomorrow.
Dr. Saxon will do the briefing.
No, I'll do it.
It's better coming from the First Lady.
I agree.
We need to address this, too.
The FBI found Goodwin's notes in his house.
Can we make them disappear?
No, it's already been catalogued.
We need to get out ahead of it and control the story.
All right. Get me a copy and report on the investigation so far.
I wanna see him.
The president.
The Secret Service still won't let me.
I'd like Mr. Stamper to have access to my husband, please.
We have strict orders, ma'am. Only you and  
Would you like me to call the vice president myself?
Douglas, this young man will escort you to his room.
Thank you.
  What time is it?   It's a little past :.
Sir? Sir, it's Doug.
Just because his eyes are open
doesn't mean he's fully conscious.
Insufficient liver function.
His brain is swimming in a pool of unprocessed ammonia.
If he's seeing anything, it's probably severe hallucinations.
How long until he has a liver?
Could be hours. Could be days.
He's number three on the list.
Number three?
It's prioritized in terms of need
and who was listed first as a Status .
He's the President of the United States.
It's the law.
The attorney general is resigning.
Add that to the press release for this afternoon.
  Uh, her decision or the vice president's?   My decision.
Goodwin's WITSEC was a DOJ responsibility.
We needed a head to roll.
First hers... then yours.
You'll resign tomorrow.
Doug, I know you're under a lot of pressure, but  
You sent the photo of the rebel soldier.
That's not true.
Personal phone, off the premises.
You know, maybe somebody hacked my account or something  
Are you really gonna keep lying to me?
I could have you arrested.
But I'd rather you go quietly.
I know things, Doug.
Nothing you can prove.
Now, threaten me again.
There's no proposal without China's involvement.
Now, Cathy's tried,
but she doesn't have the best relationship with them.
Maybe she needs some help.
Help? How?
Do you mind if I smoke?
Of course not.
I quit about ten years ago.
Marjory forced me to.
Ah, still smells delicious.
What was it like when Marjory died?
Oh, well, it was, um...
I'm sorry. We don't have to talk about it if you don't want.
No, it's fine.
We hadn't had a real conversation in... in months.
Her mind was gone.
When she finally died,
it felt like a limb had been hacked off.
I felt... devastated.
But I also felt relieved.
That's what I feel about my mother.
Oh, I hadn't   It hadn't even occurred to me.
You have Frank and your mother.
When my father died, it destroyed me,
but when I think about Mother, I feel nothing.
  You two aren't close?   No.
And I feel the same about Francis.
Nothing.
I know that must sound awful.
It's a lot to process.
There's no right way or wrong way.
  Wait, hold on.   No.
Marjory wouldn't approve.
We got sidetracked.
Yes. China.
I have an idea, if you can trust me to handle it.
I'd trust you with my goddamn life, Claire.
You don't want to know.
I got it. Ah, merci.
LeAnn.
You are a tough guy to track down.
  What are you doing here?   You have a plane to catch.
The First Lady needs your help.
I don't want to have anything to do with them.
Whatever you think of the president,
you still have a duty to your country.
Even if he dies, the day I walked out the White House,
I promised myself I wasn't going back.
You don't even know what we have in mind.
It doesn't matter. I'm not going.
I'd like you to leave.
Here's your briefing materials.
You're not hearing me.
You should really take a look.
Her campaign would be over.
And what would your parents think?
It looks like you're taking advantage of the fact that he's  
Conway is still campaigning.
He's a Republican
and he's already wrapped up his nomination.
Apples and oranges.
We are gonna lose,
if we sit still, to a guy who's unconscious.
Heather's right. Underwood's scoring major sympathy points.
He's ahead in six of the next seven states.
We need to keep the pressure up.
Russia, gas prices...
Attack a president who's fighting for his life?
I didn't call this meeting to debate.
I want those states back.
So let's start organizing events and media hits.
Prelim budgets and schedules, by tomorrow morning.
There has been much speculation as to Goodwin's motivations.
Cynthia.
Where are we on Goodwin?
The security guy's taken care of.
He never saw the two of you together.
What about others?
None that he knows of.
But it's not like we can ask around.
In November of ,
Ms. Barnes was struck by a D.C. metrorail train.
D.C. police classified it as an accident.
Some have speculated that...
Have a seat, Remy.
Sorry about Frank.
Oh, please, don't bother.
I've had enough people say they're sorry,
and I know you don't mean it.
I can't help you the way you want me to.
LeAnn told me she was very clear with you.
It won't work.
Tusk wants to help you even less than I do.
Well, nobody's doing any favors here, Remy.
He's going to get very rich from this.
Why don't you speak to him yourself?
Because he won't listen to me.
This needs to seem like your idea, not mine.
And you'll make a killing, too.
I don't need the money.
Because you care about other things now.
Like Jackie.
Which is why you'll make this happen.
If I had told Dunbar about Frank...
about how he knew about the laundering,
he wouldn't be president and we wouldn't be standing here.
But you didn't and you can't now,
so here we are.
Two hours and we got nowhere.
All he wants to hear is China.
I told him Beijing is not responsive.
He doesn't give a damn.
The First Lady put a bug in his ear.
Well, whatever bug she put in there won't crawl out.
I'll set up a meeting. Just you, me and him.
I don't think a meeting is enough.
We have a vice president
that does not know what he is doing, Doug.
He needs to completely turn over
all diplomatic affairs to the State Department.
  Otherwise, my hands are tied.   Not now.
This can't wait.
When we're finished, I will come and find you.
Could you give us a few moments, Madam Secretary?
  Seth, you're out of line!   It's all right.
Call me.
I will. Thank you, Cathy.
Thank you.
  What the fuck are you doing?   You can't fire me.
You don't interrupt a meeting with the Secretary of State.
I can end Dunbar's campaign.
We can end it today.
How?
If I deliver, will you keep me on?
You tell me how first.
Have a seat, Martha.
I've had second thoughts about your resignation.
Would you like to remain as attorney general?
Yes, I would.
Thank you, Doug.
Did Heather Dunbar inform you
of a meeting between herself and Lucas Goodwin?
You're having me interrogated by my own subordinates?
They only work for you if you keep your job.
I suggest you answer their questions.
I'd like a lawyer present.
Let me remind you, ma'am.
Failing to have informed us constitutes withholding of evidence.
Heather is a friend.
It's very simple, Martha.
You work with us, you stay on as AG.
You don't, we prosecute.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the First Lady of the United States.
Good afternoon, everyone.
I'd like to update you on my husband's recovery.
The President's medical team
gave me a full assessment last night
and they have come to the conclusion
that the President is in need of a liver transplant
if he's to survive.
I'm asking the nation to pray with me
that a healthy liver makes its way to Francis soon.
I'm sorry. A moment.
I'm sorry.
She's good, isn't she?
What're you doing here?
As for the investigation...
First Lady wanted some support.
...the FBI director of counterterrorism
will give you a full briefing. But...
I feel it's important to personally address
the document found in Mr. Goodwin's residence
that was made available to you just before this conference.
It's filled with language that would make for flashy headlines,
words like "murder," "corruption."
The accusation that the President was involved in the deaths
of Peter Russo and Zoe Barnes.
Phrases like "abuse of power,"
while they have no basis in reality,
they do give us a sad glimpse into a very troubled mind.
And it pains me that anyone,
even someone who is mentally ill,
would think my husband is capable of
what Mr.Goodwin believed to be true.
But mostly it pains me for Mr. Goodwin's parents,
who are coping with the loss of their son.
And, by all accounts, he was a decent man for most of his life,
but clearly, something snapped in him
and he never got the help he so desperately needed.
So I ask that all of you respect his parents' grief
by not sensationalizing the words of a sick young man.
And let's remember Lawrence and Betty Meechum,
whose son Edward
gave his life because of Mr. Goodwin's illness.
Edward's sacrifice is the only reason my husband is still alive.
And I'll be forever grateful
for his friendship and his devoted service.
Thank you.
Counterterrorism Director Nathan Green.
Today we had a new development in the investigation.
This afternoon, we interviewed the Attorney General.
She gave us a full account of a conversation she had
with Heather Dunbar the day of the shooting.
In this conversation, Ms. Dunbar claimed to have met
with Lucas Goodwin personally.
And while we have no reason to believe
Ms. Dunbar had anything to do with the assassination attempt...
we will be questioning her about this alleged conversation.
Are you arresting her?
No, ma'am. We're here to ask a few questions.
  Then you need to make a formal request.   Is she here now?
Send the request directly to me,
and then I'll discuss it with Ms. Dunbar's attorneys.
Hey, Kate.
I tried calling. Home and cell.
Pulled out the cord. Turned off the cell.
Because of people like me.
The others had the courtesy not to show up on my doorstep.
Courtesy never got me anywhere.
Can we talk? Off the record.
If it were anyone but you...
Well, luckily, it isn't.
Let me get Fausto. It's time for his walk.
I'm in the nuclear game, not fossil fuels.
No one has the relationships you do in China.
Chinese disowned me.
They'll come around.
Who put you up to this?
Starting my own firm.
I thought you were out?
I was fooling myself.
So, president gets shot,
and you just can't help taking advantage of the chaos.
What you call chaos, I call opportunity.
And you're my first client.
I wish you the best.
But I'm not your first client.
I don't wanna have anything to do with the White House.
You lost a lot of money during the Walker scandal.
I did, indeed, which is why I'm turning you down.
I'm sorry you came all the way out here for a "No."
You don't wanna go to prison, do you?
Lose the rest of it?
I've already been pardoned.
For the money laundering, not for perjury.
You said that Walker knew, and he didn't.
What you didn't say is that you were working with Frank.
Why should anybody believe you more than me?
You take that chance...
and watch Clayton West become a penny stock.
Or we're heroes for ending the oil crisis,
everybody gets rich, your image is restored.
They'll probably even let you choose
the next ambassador in Beijing.
So you don't think any of it is true?
No.
And I wanted to believe him.
So the First Lady's whole teary-eyed thing?
I think she's right.
Something in Lucas snapped.
I mean, the Lucas I knew wouldn't have tried to kill a president.
Exactly. That's my point.
You honestly think Underwood was murdering people?
Where is your skepticism?
I'm skeptical of Lucas and I'm skeptical of the White House.
How come there's no proof?
None.
After Lucas tried, after I tried.
My advice is to let it go.
You're gonna repeat the same goose chase we did.
I had to ask.
  What does your editor say?   To let it go.
You see?
  He's not as good as you are.   Was.
Wish you were at The Telegraph.
Yeah, let me know if anyone gets fired.
It's open.
I came as soon as I got your text.
We've been slammed since the press conference.
How's it lookin'?
Major play on the Dunbar story.
It was a good idea to have the First Lady talk.
You want a soda?
A glass of water or anything?
Water's fine.
I've decided you can stay.
Doug, I hope you can understand.
I got nervous.
You know, things weren't looking good and...
yeah, I wanted an out, in case I needed one.
I mean, it was a mistake. I wish I hadn't.
You corrected your mistakes.
That's all that matters. You want ice?
Sure.
We can't afford any more shake-ups in the campaign right now,
especially with the president in the hospital.
We also can't afford any more of your mistakes.
Shut up. Shut up!
When I first woke up, I couldn't speak.
I had to blink my eyes if I wanted to respond.
Do you understand?
If I can't get your loyalty,
I will have your obedience.
Blink.
Blink!
Fuck!
Fucking...
Here.
You're fucked up, man.
  Quit it.   Good morning, Mr. Hammerschmidt.
How can I help you?
Uh, we're just returning your notes.
We made copies. These are the originals.
Nothing too useful, huh?
No, sir, but thank you for your cooperation.
Your paper, too. It was on the step.
Well, you have a good day, Mr. Hammerschmidt.
You, too.
Don't tell me you're hungry already.
I just fed you. Good God.
I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
  Morning.   Morning.
I suggest we turn the negotiations over to Cathy.
If we keep stalling on Russia, gas prices will  
Now is not a good time.
I won't have the president
come back to a White House in disarray.
We don't know that he is coming back.
He is. I promise you that.
Are you God? Who are you to say?
Yes?
Mr. Tusk and Mr. Danton are here.
Send them in.
It was arranged this morning. We're discussing Russia.
Sir, I am the Chief of Staff.
You have to keep me informed of these things.
Excuse me,
but I believe you answer to me,
not the other way around.
Secretary Durant should be here.
This meeting is private.
I'll discuss it with you both after.
The president would never allow Raymond  
  Mr. President.   Mr. Tusk.
Remy, good to see you.
  Mr. President.   Mr. Stamper.
I'll follow up with you later, Doug.
Yes, sir.
Thanks for taking the time to meet with us on such short notice.
Well, there's no time to waste on this oil thing.
I've made some progress with the Chinese.
Sir, the First Lady is in there right now.
She's expecting me.
We're trying to win an election,
and you want to remind everyone
that the president pardoned Raymond Tusk?
Let's find somewhere else.
These are matters of state.
You don't have the authority to intervene.
If Donald wants my counsel, that is his prerogative.
You are deliberately deceiving me.
  Going behind my     You have forgotten your place, Douglas.
My place? What about your place?
You leave him when he needs you most, you threaten him,
and now that he's in here, you undermine him.
  You're supposed to be     Stop. That is enough.
I will fill you in on everything,
but not here. At the White House.
What's happening?
His heart.
  Doctor?   He's had some sporadic arrhythmia.
  Will you give us the room for a moment?   Of course.
We can't keep battling each other,
not with him like this.
We need a new path forward,
and I would like your help with that.
I promise I won't keep you in the dark.
I'll meet you at the White House whenever you're ready.
I'm staying here. I think this is more important.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood.
Mr. Tusk and Mr. Danton have a proposal
about how to deal with Russia.
I imagine I'm the last person you expected to see today.
I am a bit surprised,
yes, to see both of you.
I'm sure there's some wariness about us being here,
but I think we have a good plan on how to handle Russia.
Would you like to join us?
Raymond can lay it out for you.
Well, I don't know what I can offer.
Well, we're going to catch some flack if word gets out
that I'm back in business with the White House.
You could help us smooth that over.
Your press conference was very moving.
  I'm sorry about Frank.   Thank you.
Of course, he'd have a conniption fit
if he knew I were in the Oval Office.
Well, he is a pragmatist, Raymond. Whatever works.
  Shall we continue?   Remy.
So, the plan is to propose a partnership
between American and Chinese energy companies.
You seem nervous.
It's been a while.
What should I do, boss?
Dr. Saxon.
I'd like to donate.
  Mr. Stamper     My blood type is O.
I'm healthy. Let's do the tests.
That's not the only criteria for donation.
You're a recovering alcoholic. We don't accept  
I don't care about the rules.
If I'm a match, I want you to do it.
Even if you were, it wouldn't matter.
He's too ill for a partial liver at this point.
He needs a full one.
I'm sorry, but we'll just have to wait and hope.House.of.Cards.SE
China provides   of the bailout,
the IMF provides another  
and a consortium of American and Chinese energy companies
tackles the remaining  ,
in exchange for which they get drilling rights.
The US would only have to contribute  of the   billion.
Russian companies would oversee production
and get a slice of the revenues.
These are the proposed development zones.
We split the drilling rights?
Yes, sir. China puts in more money,
but we contribute our drilling technology.
Should we really be sharing that?
They're already trying to hack it from us.
Has Petrov agreed to this?
I'm planning to propose
it to him in Brandenburg at the G Summit.
We've invited Russia and China to attend,
but we didn't wanna move forward
until we had congressional approval.
  Bob?   We should discuss privately.
You're going to Brandenburg yourself?
If his health continues to worsen  
We'll assess as we get closer,
but, no, I'll stay here if it looks dire.
We should probably draft an appropriation
in case we need to pay for a state funeral.
  Doug.   Madam Secretary.
I could've come to the White House.
The organ network, it answers to you.
Yes and no. Uh, in a regulatory capacity  
You have the power to modify the recipient list.
That's up to the network.
They have an expert committee that  
The president's life isn't going to be decided by a committee.
Let me show you something.
He was number three yesterday. Number one got a transplant.
Makes the president number two. His chances are very good.
But this man, Anthony Moretti, he's just hours away from dying.
Then let him die.
I'm not doing this.
It's not just the law. It's the ethics  
Then change your ethics.
Or you can resign, and your deputy can make this call.
And if he won't, then he can resign, too.
I will strip away this entire department until I find who I need.
Now make the call.
  Okay, I'm on.   You ever use it?
No, I use Google.
Uh, it's a small market share,
but still, it's billions of searches a month.
Now, what if a certain candidate got more hits,
was ranked higher,
more positive coverage favored over negative coverage?
What if that candidate was William Conway?
Manipulating searches? The public would turn on them.
It gets them millions of votes.
Can you get me solid proof?
Well, I am not getting involved in something like this.
What I will give you is advice as a friend.
Don't waste a year of your life on the Underwoods.
They've already lost the election
and they don't even realize it.
I know you're only trying to help,
and I'm sure you must feel frightened
about Frank's condition  
You don't have to be delicate, Cathy.
I'd like you to let me do my job.
China cannot be at the center of this negotiation,
or Raymond Tusk.
Involving the oil companies
is the only shot we have at winning Republican support.
Do you remember when we played beer pong and you let me win?
The two of us were sitting right over there,
in those two chairs,
and you asked me for my advice.
It was good advice.
And you listened to it. I don't know why you won't now.
You were proposing a way forward. This time you're not.
Well, unlike you, my nomination was confirmed by the Senate,
because they believed I knew what I was doing.
Forgive me, Claire, but it seems to me
that you are taking advantage of the situation
to assert authority you don't have a right to assert.
Cathy, you don't have Francis right now.
I'm the best thing you've got,
so please work with me on this.
Congress will never approve this.
You're just wasting everybody's time.
The Republicans will get in line.
Not the Republicans, the Democrats.
I spoke to Jackie Sharp.
When she heard you developed this plan...
She's a formidable woman, Claire, and very persuasive.
  Remy Danton.   Remy, we need to talk about Jackie.
Such a nice night.
Let's go somewhere outside.
And where do you wanna go?
Take me to the bay.
We'll go skinny-dipping.
I thought you only had a couple hours.
I'll make up some excuse.
I'm sick of hotel rooms.
We both got a big day tomorrow.
Why are you being no fun?
Because you're trying to kill my bill.
You didn't wanna see me. You wanted to lobby me.
  Jackie, listen   Who told you I was against it?
Birch's Chief of Staff.
Well, I'm sure you stand to make a lot of money on this, but  
It's not about the money.
Isn't that how Claire convinced you?
I just wanted to leave it tonight.
I didn't wanna be mad at you.
I just wanted...
I don't understand why you're helping her.
You've gotta get Birch on board.
The Underwoods have lied to me,
they've used me, they've tried to intimidate me.
I don't know what Claire's up to,
but I'm not gonna let it happen without a fight,
not with the State Department against it.
Claire knows.
About you and me.
She got photographs
of us leaving the same hotel at the same time, multiple occasions.
Take me back to my car.
  Jackie, listen...   Turn around now, please.
It's the reason I haven't been in touch.
I wanted to protect you...
  but she's making     I don't wanna talk about it.
Just stop the car and let me out or drive me back.
I'll take you back.
A day or two.
We might not have much warning, Mr. President.
When the liver is this close to failure,
things can happen suddenly.
You should be prepared.
  What's happening with his hands?   It's called asterixis.
It happens when the body can't clear ammonia.
Thank you, Dr. Saxon.
I'm not going to Brandenburg.
No, you have to.
  Cathy will negotiate on my behalf.   I don't trust her on this.
That's a risk we'll have to take.
The risk I won't take is being overseas if the president dies.
We don't even know if Congress
will approve the appropriation for the bailout.
They will approve it. I'll make sure they do.
You shouldn't be worrying about this now, Claire.
You should be focused on Frank.
We need to put him on the ventilator
to protect his airways.
You should go, ma'am. Go get some rest.
  Now's not a good time, LeAnn.   This can't wait.
  What is it?   Pollyhop.
  The search engine?   Conway is working with them.
They can manipulate what people search for.
It gives them a huge advantage  
Wait, slow down. What does this mean?
It means that we lose.
Conway's name, his image,
they can control what people see. They can force-feed it.
Even if they're not doing that,
even if they're just tracking users, it's enough to beat us.
You know what people are searching for, you know everything,
their hopes, their fears,
what they're thinking about when they're staring at the ceiling
in the middle of the night.
  Who told you this?   Someone I trust.
I can't deal with this right now.
We have to do something, Claire, or the election  
LeAnn, my husband just had a seizure.
There may not even be an election.
I'm sorry. I  
If Francis survives, we will deal with this then.
Right now, I need to focus on what's right in front of me.
There was no criminal wrongdoing.
That we can fathom. But why take the chance?
Because pleading the Fifth makes it look like I broke the law.
I agree.
So I'll tell the truth. I'll own it.
Yes, that you didn't meet with him.
Are you suggesting that  
It's the Attorney General's word against Heather's.
As your lawyer, I can't be part of this conversation.
We can still win this campaign.
I'll be in the lobby.
I'll back you up.
The security detail only saw me and Goodwin together,
not the two of you.
This is under oath.
Underwood's people are trying to smear us.
The whole point of this campaign
was to be the opposite of Underwood.
I thought you wanted this.
Not if it means breaking the law.
Do you think he'd even be having this conversation?
You actually care about the law, Heather...
which is why you need to be president.
  Mrs. Underwood.   Bob, I didn't realize  
The Leader and I were just discussing the bailout package.
President Blythe just wanted me to stress
how important it is that the Democrats stick together right now
with Francis being  
There's no need.
I just called the Speaker to schedule an emergency vote.
I'm sure the President will be pleased.
  How's Frank?   He's hanging in there.
I'm sure you wanna get back to the hospital.
But thank you for making the personal visit.
Thoughts and prayers, Claire.
Thank you, Bob.
I'll walk you out.
Excuse me, Leader.
You came here to threaten me.
We don't need to be at odds, Jackie.
Do you plan on hanging this over my head
every time I try to oppose you?
You can't fault me for your sloppiness.
That's a "Yes."
As long as we're working together,
you have nothing to worry about.
Mr. President, I wouldn't get your hopes up.
The members of the G
are already ruffled because Russia was invited,
and Petrov may be using this opportunity
to embarrass us in front of the international community.
Yes?
  The First Lady is here, sir.   Send her in.
Sir, I would like to finish our briefing  
I'm not gonna keep the First Lady waiting if she wants to see me.
  I'm sure you've heard.   Yes, Birch called a few minutes ago.
I'd like to join you in Brandenburg, Cathy.
Well, I appreciate you wanting to pitch in,
but I really don't think that's necessary.
Well, I know this plan better than anyone.
  Mr. President...   There is only one shot at this.
  Everyone at the same table.   What about Frank?
In Brandenburg, I can be useful. I can't here.
The First Lady cannot
negotiate on behalf of the United States government.
The delegation is at your discretion, Mr. President.
It might be good for you to have some support.
Her presence undermines my authority as Secretary of State.
Cathy, Petrov is incredibly stubborn. Trust me, I know.
Why wouldn't you wanna have every asset available to you?
Allow me to do this, Mr. President.
  Sir     If it increases our chances.
It will, I promise.
Then join us. We're going over the briefing now.
You tried, Frank...
which is more than most people ever do.
Right now, it's just us.
Rest your eyes.
We have all the time in the world.
Danny, what was that?
  Danny?   Nothing, Mom.
Open the door.
Open the door.
Mrs. Underwood? Dr. Saxon is on the line.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Good evening, or good morning.
President Underwood is currently being prepped for surgery
to receive a liver transplant.
Barring any complications,
the surgery is expected to take  to  hours.
Uh, we'll update you about the progress if need be,
but probably nothing more until the operation's completed.
We can turn the plane around right now, ma'am.
You'll be back before he's out of surgery.
We should do that, Claire.
I'll be late to the summit, but everyone will  
No. We're almost there.
  We keep going.   Honestly, Claire  
  Inform the captain to stay on course.   Yes, ma'am.
Connect me with Seth Grayson, please.
He's already gone in.
The First Lady is currently en route to Brandenburg
and will not be in Washington for the surgery.
She will continue onto the G
Summit to assist Secretary Durant, as planned.
She asked me to read the following statement.
"It was a difficult decision for me not to return..."
But I know my husband. If he were conscious...
"...he'd tell me to press on..."
...that the best way to be at his side is to serve my country.
"And I can serve it better in Germany than in a waiting room.
If there's an emergency, I'll return immediately..."
...but I have the utmost faith...
"...in the medical team at Jefferson Memorial."
I'm praying for a successful procedure,
and I ask all of you to join me in praying for my husband,
your president.
Right over there, Ms. Dunbar.
Will your attorneys be joining us?
I've asked my attorneys not to attend.
We have to advise you that it's in your best interest  
I'm well aware, Mr. Morgan.
It's not my first time at this table.
Thank you, President Zhou. President Petrov?
Russia shares China's desire for inclusion.
We are looking forward to productive talks.
And we also want to extend our sincere best wishes
for President Underwood's surgery.
He is dearly missed at this meeting.
Thank you, Mr. President.
So, shall we begin?
The most pressing order of business
is the joint IMF, American-Chinese debt relief package
to the Russian Federation.
We're recording?
Ms. Dunbar, any statement you make
will be part of the public record as part of the DOJ report.
Although this video is simply for purposes of...
You can make the video available to the media.
I have nothing to hide.
So you're waiving your right to keep the video from public view?
I am.
The attorney general says you pressured her
to look into Lucas Goodwin's claims  
I've read the attorney general's statement.
We also have a deposition from a young woman,
a staffer, who says Goodwin
posed as a volunteer at an event in Cincinnati on March th.
Did you meet with Mr. Goodwin?
I shake hundreds of people's hands at every event.
If he was in Cincinnati, there's a chance I may have shaken his.
But the claim that he and I met one-on-one...
So you're saying you didn't meet with him?
We have phone records, Ms. Dunbar.
You did speak to the attorney general.
Martha is my former boss and an old friend.
We speak frequently. Why she would claim that I...
We need a simple answer, Ms. Dunbar.
Did you or did you not
meet with Lucas Goodwin privately in Cincinnati?
Yes.
I met with a man I didn't know
who turned out to be unhinged.
I contacted the attorney general
because she's the top law enforcement official in the country
and WITSEC is under her jurisdiction.
I did nothing wrong.
Tell us the nature of this meeting.
I'd like to say, for the record,
that I think this interview is an act of political sabotage.
Its goal is to make me look guilty by association,
but there are the way things look and the way things actually are.
When I investigated Frank Underwood,
he looked innocent, but he wasn't.
I couldn't prove it, but I knew it to be true.
Ms. Dunbar...
You have proof that I met with Mr. Goodwin.
I've admitted it.
All that proves is that I'm honest,
unlike a president who would use the Department of Justice
to target his political opponent for his own personal gain.
Let me remind you, ma'am,
the president was unconscious when this investigation began...
It doesn't matter whether he was unconscious or not,
whether he lives or dies.
The president is the people who work for him.
I don't think this is going to work.
Petrov's talking the talk in session,
but he won't meet with me privately.
Chinese are ready to sign, if that's the hold-up.
It's not the Chinese.
He refuses to meet with anyone other than a head of state.
Then see if he'll meet with the president's wife.
It doesn't change the fact that he is morally corrupt,
and he has corrupted the institutions that report to him.
That is why I am running for president,
because someone needs to fight this.
So not only did she meet with Goodwin,
she's using the investigation to attack a president
who's on the operating table as we speak.
Yeah, the way she keeps defending herself
only gives conspiracy theorists more...
She's done.
Now, I'm not saying that she was involved...
Without a doubt.
...but many are taking to social media...
  Seth.   Hello, Cynthia.
Think you might have anything for me?
...and certainly not a president whose approval rating...
On your campaign?
Yeah, it's ironic...
I'm gonna hang up now. Good luck.
...but I think she may have just tanked it.
Mr. President... the transplant's complete.
Now they're closing him up.
We'll see how he accepts the new organ.
Maybe we should try and get Claire on the phone.
Yeah.
Soon. We're waiting for him now.
Okay. Okay, thank you, Donald.
  So it's going well?   Well, unless his body rejects the liver.
  Mr. President.   Mrs. Underwood.
Mr. President.
I thought we were meeting alone.
As the administration's representative,
I need to participate in any conversations  
Madam Secretary, I believe my people were very clear, hmm?
Would you give us a moment, please, Cathy?
Just a little while.
I'll be outside.
So... how is surgery going?
So far, so good.
Ah, you must be exhausted. Now, sit. Sit.
I imagine you'd rather be at the hospital.
Well, this is too important,
and you weren't going to negotiate with Secretary Durant.
What makes you think I'll negotiate with you?
Oh, well, isn't that why we're sitting here?
Maybe I just wanted to... see your face again.
Maybe I'm fond of it.
You are a beautiful woman, Mrs. Underwood, hmm?
Those lips...
Would you say something for me?
Would you say, um...
"Shame on you... Mr. President."
Really, Viktor? Are we gonna dredge that up?
An apology would do...
if you want to negotiate...
Well, you would lose respect for me if I apologized.
Yes.
Yes, this is true.
I'm not here for a sightseeing trip, Viktor.
So, Francis needs a liver and I need a bailout.
  What do you need?   I need for you to agree to the terms.
Oh, yes, the terms. The terms, yes.
But why are you here... and not with Francis?
When your mother is sick, you go to her.
Not your husband, hmm?
Were the stories true?
Are there problems, Claire?
What are your concerns with the Chinese?
There are too many drilling sites in sensitive areas.
It's a security issue to us.
And what sites, in particular, are you worried about?
Oh, you... you are familiar with the individual zones?
It's my plan. I know it backwards and forwards.
I see, so that's why it's so important to you.
Because it's yours.
Is it one of these?
On the Pacific coast?
You asked for me, sir?
I wanna get out of this place as soon as possible.
I'll make sure of it, sir.
Where's Claire?
She's in Germany.
Germany?
A lot to catch you up on, Mr. President.
  Raymond.   The Chinese are getting skittish.
They wanna know why it's taking so long.
Now, if Petrov doesn't agree soon, they may back out.
  Thank you, Raymond.   I'm on standby.
We need to shake hands on this.
No. No, I told you, nothing on Sakhalin Island.
It's two zones on the southern end. Then you have your bailout.
It opens a door I don't want to open.
They're being more than reasonable, Mr. President.
Reasonable? In whose eyes?
You and China are raping Siberia.
We didn't run your economy into the ground.
You did.
Is this how you tried to convince Michael Corrigan
before he hung himself?
Because that's what you are asking me to do,
to tie the noose around my own neck.
What's next? The Black Sea? The Arctic?
I cannot allow the Chinese ships
to come this close to my sovereign  
Mrs. Underwood, President Underwood is on the line.
  He's awake?   Yes, ma'am.
Go, go. We're done here.
  I can't speak with him right now.   Mrs. Underwood  
I will let you know when I'm available.
Yes, ma'am.
You should talk to your husband.
I'm not leaving here until we have an agreement.
But you're an amateur, Claire.
You fly in, you puff up your chest
and you pretend to play president.
But what would you be without your husband?
Nothing. A pretty face.
So, yes, play the president if you like.
Go. Tell the Chinese they get nothing on the Pacific.
You think you can do that, Mrs. Underwood?
Your people are hurting.
Six months at most, they're gonna be marching on Red Square.
I'm done letting you have your dignity.
The truth is you're a beggar on your knees,
and you will take whatever we shove down your throat.
Viktor.
Take the deal. Get your dignity back.
Madam Secretary.
Joint control of zones  and .
We've got an agreement, pending the president's approval.
Well, he's sleeping now.
They're moving him back to the White House soon.
  And how did he seem?   I only talked to him briefly,
but the doctors say the organ is... taking well so far.
They're expecting a quick recovery.
You've done an outstanding job, Mr. President.
  So have you, Claire.   I'm going to try and get some rest.
Of course. Have a safe flight.
Experts were pessimistic that
anything meaningful could come out of the summit.
Draft of the appropriations bill from the Speaker's office.
Just put it on the desk, please.
...Catherine Durant had this to say from Brandenburg.
President Petrov and I worked through the night
in concert with the Chinese government
in order to come up with an agreement.
Along with partners in the private sector,
the United States, China, and Russia will collaborate on a plan
to extract oil from untapped sites in eastern Siberia.
This will then enable a return to a more stable oil market,
as well as a stable global economy.
Now, in order to make this plan viable
and mitigate any tax burden...
...to the American and Chinese taxpayers,
the corporations will provide the bulk of the investment,
the, uh, infrastructure to extract the oil and the technology.
and then any of the profits
will then be distributed commensurately among
these corporations, as well,
and including the land value invested by the Russian government.
So at this time, I'd like to open the floor to any questions.
I'm getting a lot of
questions about the First Lady's involvement.
We stick to our message that she was just there to assist.
Secretary Durant led the effort.
There's multiple reports that she and Petrov had a long meeting.
They greeted each other. That's it.
So we deny?
The President hasn't approved the plan yet.
We wanna focus on his recovery, not the 
  Yes?   Secretary of Health for you, sir.
I'll find you in your office.
Madam Secretary.
  I just sent you an email.   Hold on.
What is this?
The father you see there?
That's who we bumped for the President.
He died an hour ago.
Father of two, loving husband.
Delete it right now from your outbox.
I already did, but I wanted you to see his face...
the family he left behind.
Well, uh, it will probably take a few days, but, uh, I'm  
My wife is up.
Thank you, gentlemen.
  Mrs. Underwood.   Mrs. Underwood.
Claire.
Are you in a lot of pain?
Nothing I can't handle.
Meechum?
I spoke to his mother.
  Francis, don't...   Help me up.
Are you sure?
Yes. It's good for the recovery.
Doctor's orders.
They want me on my feet at least once a day.
Let's take a walk.
Now, let me see if I can do it.
I need a minute.
I'm going to approve your plan.
It's a good plan.
It was hard.
Harder than I thought it would be.
Stay with me.
It's us against them. Always.
Otherwise, what's the goddamn point?
I can't do it, Francis.
I can't come back and be First Lady.
Not that.
Not that.
I said you were nothing, in the Oval, without me.
It's the other way around.
It would have to be different.
I know.
That's what I'm saying.
Come on. Let's see if you can make it to the end of the hall.House.of.Cards.SE
...supporting my efforts to reform the Democratic Party...
and to restore integrity to the Oval Office.
Unfortunately,
I won't be able to complete the work I set out to achieve.
It has become clear that my candidacy has become
a distraction rather than a solution...
that controversy has trumped the issues.
And for that reason, I am ending my bid...
...to be the Democratic nominee for president.
That was Heather Dunbar from her campaign headquarters in Washington.
With Dunbar out, that leaves President Underwood
as the presumptive nominee.
The focus now is on who President Underwood's running  
Good morning.
Good morning.
Mommy?
Hello, darling.
  I want breakfast.   You want breakfast?
  Where's Daddy?   Oh, he's getting ready for work.
I'm gonna cut your hair.
  No! No! No!   I'm gonna cut your hair.
  No! No! No! No!   What do you mean "No"?
No!
I'm gonna make you a little bald boy.
No! No, shave Mom's head, not mine!
Shave Mom's head? Okay.
  No! No!   I'll shave Mom's head.
  No.   I'll shave Mom's head.
We've been moving so quickly.
Maybe we should take a step back. Think this through again.
We can't afford to be weird with each other, Claire.
Weird? What do you mean?
I saw you in the bathroom... looking at me.
It's not the first time.
Sometimes I want to say something, I just don't know what to say.
  It's uncomfortable.   Maybe it will always be like that.
But we have to separate that out. It can't affect our plan.
Because that's the one thing...
that we have figured out.
When Walker and Vasquez...
betrayed us,
pulled the Secretary of State right out from under my feet,
there was no room for doubt, and you made me remember that.
We took a path...
a difficult one,
because we had no guarantee where it was going to lead us.
It took a steel goddamn stomach,
and so has everything else we had to do since.
So don't worry about you and me now.
Find your steel, Claire.
Thank you all very much for coming.
Have you seen this?
ICO. Islamic Caliphate Organization.
Ahmed and Yusuf Al Ahmadi.
They've been smart about keeping split up.
If one dies, the other takes over.
But they're holding a planning session in northern Syria.
Both are there right now.
I got my ass handed to me over the Jordan Valley.
I'm not gonna launch a missile strike
unless I believe that there's an overwhelming
national security threat,
and I'm just not convinced that they pose one.
The president believes ICO to be a serious threat.
We believe they are actively recruiting American citizens.
Accordingly, the government is requesting
a Section  upstream surveillance order.
  Domestic surveillance.   Monitoring traffic, not individuals.
Approach the bench.
The FISA Court. Classified rulings behind closed doors.
Not even these men know we have a lawyer in there this morning.
ICO already has three oil fields under their control.
They made a fortune selling crude
when Russia cut down production.
It's blowback, sir. It's our responsibility to address it.
If we launch strikes, we radicalize even more extremists.
Sir, their army will grow.
The Ahmadis are former Baathists
with strong business ties.
We can cut the head off before they get bigger if we strike now.
If the threat level increases, we'll reassess.
Sir, we have a very limited window.
General, the president's made his decision.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
I have rubber-stamped some borderline requests, Steve,
  but this is very     I know.
I was surprised, too.
But it's straight from the White House.
Well, this is going to take some time.
I have to do a proper review.
This gun was illegally obtained by a career criminal
at a gun show where background checks aren't mandatory.
This gun killed Officer Dempsey's partner
at a routine traffic stop.
This one was ordered on the Internet. No background checks.
This gun killed Bob and Sue Grant's  year-old son.
And this is the gun that killed Agent Edward Meechum.
Not many Secret Service agents buried at Arlington.
I'd say he earned his place.
I took it for granted, how important he was to me,
how much I leaned on him.
It's clear to me now, now that he's gone.
I don't wanna make the same mistake with you, Donald.
How do you mean?
I didn't realize how much I lean on you.
The way you handled everything after I was shot,
it was masterful.
Well, I... I guess I kept my head above water.
Claire told me how supportive you were,
what a natural leader you proved to be.
I want that by my side, Donald,
the same way that Meechum was, as my running mate.
You want me on the ticket?
A heartbeat away from the presidency is a serious matter now.
Conway is a tough opponent.
I never expected you'd want me.
I thought I was just a placeholder.
No, we can win, Donald. You and I, together.
I don't know, Frank.
You need someone who's hungry for this.
I'm not a great campaigner.
  Vermont doesn't help you.   You have a deep sense of duty,
like all the men and women here who served their country,
and that's far more important to me than strategy.
To be honest, I don't know if I want it, Frank.
When I had to take over, the stress, the responsibility...
Two weeks as president was about as much as I can handle.
I'm disappointed, Donald.
But I understand.
And I won't pressure you.
Should we do this?
Okay.
Do you have other folks in mind, if it isn't me?
Well, we should probably reach out to the leadership,
and get their advice.
But you're right.
Whoever it is, they need to be hungry for it.
All of these deaths could have been prevented.
And that's why
I'm working with a coalition of senators to introduce a law
that will extend background checks to all gun transactions,
including gun shows and online sales.
And let me be clear, this is not an assault on gun ownership.
It's an assault on illegal gun ownership.
I'll now take questions.
The next President of the United States,
the love of my life, the best father a mother could hope for,
my husband, Will Conway.
Conway! Conway! Conway!
Hello, New York!
He's ahead by double digits in every battleground state.
The RNC is raising two-to-one what we have.
  This guy is a rock star.   We need our own rock star.
Who are you thinking of, Mr. President?
Donald Blythe.
Uh, don't you think there's a more strategic choice?
I am being strategic.
Look, it's one thing that Dunbar's dropped out,
but we have to get her supporters.
And Donald Blythe, he oozes integrity.
He can help us get all of those
disillusioned people back into our camp.
What about moderates in the general?
We need somebody from a swing state.
With deep fundraising pockets.
Well, look, we can sell Donald's experience.
He's filled the shoes.
I see no reason to change horses midstream.
He doesn't check off enough columns.
We want a fighter, not a professor.
I agree, sir. We can do better than Blythe.
Well, I am hard-pressed to come up with anyone better
than a man who actually knows what it's like to sit at that desk.
We can offer you some names.
  He'll be devastated.   Let me talk to him.
No, it's better that I do. Let me talk to him.
We'll get you that list right away.
Well, all right. If you can come up with some alternatives,
I'm certainly willing to listen. Thank you all very much.
And I believe the best government is that which governs least.
That's not a new idea. It's an old one.
The founder of our party, Jefferson, said it.
We need to make it new again.
We need a government that doesn't interfere with people's lives,
with their liberty, with their pursuit of happiness.
Isn't that what we need to protect?
Yes. And that's where President Underwood is failing us the most.
Doug, where are we on the, uh  
FISA Court could take a while. The judge was reluctant.
I should set up a meeting anyway.
I've never liked this plan, sir.
I don't think we should do anything until we get the court ruling.
Plan A is in motion, let's let that pan out first.
If plan A works, then fine, Pollyhop is no longer a problem,
but if it doesn't, I need to start laying the groundwork.
  Macallan could take some convincing.   We don't know this man  
Yeah, we don't absolutely need to widen the circle right now.
We do, sir.
Just to get this sort of surveillance operational can take weeks.
Yeah, but Doug is right.
We don't know him. He's a stranger to us.
He is the top data scientist in the country, maybe the world.
  He was exploring behavior adoption and   Stop.
We are talking domestic surveillance, LeAnn.
And the only theory I'm interested in is risk versus votes.
And he gets us the votes.
Didn't you hear the leadership?
They said Conway is destroying us.
Macallan reverses that, he wins us the election.
"ICO occupies Kurdish stronghold."
How many of you have heard of ICO?
They're Muslim extremists taking over oil fields in Syria.
The media is barely covering them
because the White House is turning a blind eye.
As the Governor of New York...
I can't turn a blind eye to terrorism
because it's been right here on our doorstep.
You know what I did when   happened?
I joined the Air Force because I wanted to serve my country,
just like my grandfather did
when he boarded a transport ship on this very dock
and sailed to the Pacific to fight the Japanese.
When my children grow up...
Charlie and Lily...
I wanna be able to... to look them in the eye...
and tell them that I fought for you.
I fought for your future.
And to me, that future is clear.
Less government, less taxes, more freedom, protect that freedom!
Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you.
Governor, can you comment on your relationship
with the search engine Pollyhop?
Is it true Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?
  I want Grant here, right away.   Uh, he's in California I think.
He's got two Gulf Streams. Have him pick one.
Thank you so much, thank you. Thank you, take care.
Is it true Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?
  The question was caught on camera.   Did he answer it?
No. It's getting a lot of traction online.
Should be all over the news by morning.
Have Seth send me all the stories and clips so far.
I don't think I have to meet LeAnn's guy now.
  Plan A's gonna work.   No, no, no.
Meet with him. Look, it doesn't commit us to anything.
  Sir    Look, I don't wanna go down this route any more than you do,
but at least we'll have our bases covered.
Yes, sir.
Imagine a duel. Me and Conway.
Now, Conway has a powerful gun, a search engine.
And it's powerful because with it,
he can tell what you think, what you want,
where you are and who you are.
He can turn all those searches into votes,
and that's enough bullets to kill my chances of winning.
But I have an even bigger gun. It's called the NSA.
It's one of the perks of being president.
That is, if the courts allow my surveillance request.
I imagine the men hanging on these walls
wished they'd had a gun like that available to them.
Your phone, the phone of the person sitting next to you,
your neighbor's phone and everyone you know
and the  million Americans you don't know.
I can see you, and I can use what I see to rig this election.
Now, of course, a weapon like that,
well, you can imagine how risky it is.
Huh, it might have even given pause to an old crook like him.
I mean, they roasted him on the spit
for tapping into a few rooms at the Watergate.
I'm talking about tapping into every single home in America.
And a weapon like that could blow up in my hand
and that's why it's plan B. Plan A is much safer.
Expose that Conway is using his gun illegally
and remove the weapon from his hand.
All three of us took bullets.
Well, I know why we're smiling. We survived.
Aidan. This is Doug Stamper.
Yeah, I know who he is.
Tell me why I'm here.
Domestic surveillance. We need to win an election.
  You serious?   What if we were?
The NSA...
  You'd take that risk?   If you can be trusted.
Every theory you have ever had,
everything you have ever wanted to test.
And in return, you get what?
Voter data? So you know who to target?
And how to target them, to influence them.
To brainwash them?
Oh, this is about Conway, the Pollyhop thing.
  I never should've told you that.   Are we wasting our time?
I couldn't put a single person on this.
  No. It's radioactive.   We're done.
  This is over.   How would this even work?
To get backbone access requires  
We're getting a FISA ruling, counter-terrorism.
I've never won a bid from the NSA  
  LeAnn, let's go.   You'd win the bid.
This is what you want, Aidan.
Jesus.
You came here to see if you can trust me.
How do I know I can trust you?
I don't care whether you trust me or not.
But if we go down this road,
you take the fall if anything goes wrong.
Not us, not the president. You.
It's the only way this works.
So you tell me if you think it's worth it.
The worth.
You have no idea.
Thank you so much for coming.
  Jeffrey!   Governor.
How you doing? Thank you so much.
Buying a whole table. I mean, you've just been so great to us.
Anything for you, Governor. Can I get a photo?
Of course.
How you doing, Rich?
Is this, uh, Pollyhop thing true?
Let's get Hannah in this. Hannah.
  Oh, Jeff.   Hannah, good to see you.
  Good to see you. How are you?   Mr. Grant is here.
I'm good, how are you?
Jeffrey, I'm gonna come find you, okay? I'll be right back.
  Okay.   Let's do it.
I'm getting calls from The New York Times.
There is no way we can keep a lid on this now.
We're getting calls from everyone.
If the media really digs their feet in,
forget about the public response.
We need to worry about the Justice Department.
You said what we're doing wasn't illegal.
No, I said it was gray, that it's unregulated.
Our data is proprietary.
How we want to use it, it's our prerogative.
If they put a value on the benefits of sharing all that data,
the figure would break all campaign finance caps there are.
How the fuck did this get out?
Sir? That reporter's not in our press pool.
  We didn't credential him ourselves.   So, who does he work for?
We're still trying to track that down.
Give me your phone.
I'll connect you now, sir.
You are now on with the president.
I must say, I'm disappointed.
I was hoping the first time we met would be in person.
  We've met before.   Oh, yes, that's right.
You know why I'm calling, Mr. President.
No, but I have been reading some curious articles.
How long before you think it becomes mainstream?
You planted that reporter.
I did not. You're giving me far more credit than I deserve.
If you bring the Justice Department into this,
I'll come down hard on you for abuse of power,
and that'll hurt you just as much as it hurts me.
I won't have to. They read the newspapers,
just like everyone else.
Well, then you better hold them back.
Let me remind you, Governor,
in case you do become president one day,
the Justice Department is autonomous.
If I were to intervene, it would be illegal.
Just like when you raided FEMA?
See, the country wants to believe that you're corrupt,
and I'll draw a very clear line between you  
Go ahead. The more volume on this, the better.
You hurl accusations, I'll let the press hurl facts.
But what did you really hope to achieve?
I think you've wasted your time.
You should have called me when you had some actual leverage.
But I must say, it is a treat to hear you so worked up.
I do thank you for that.
"Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln.
Tall men make good presidents." You said that when we first met.
Yes, I remember what I said.
You were intimidated.
I don't underestimate you, Governor. But intimidated?
Takes a lot more than height and arrogance to intimidate me.
You better get back to all your lawyers.
When the Roman general Sulla,
who was about the same age I am now,
marched on Rome to purge the city of usurpers,
it was a bloodbath.
His greatest rival was a young man named Marius,
who was just  years old.
And after Sulla had him killed,
he held up his head in the forum
and looked into the boy's dead eyes
and said, "First, you must learn to pull an oar.
Only then can you take the helm."
Will.
I called the president.
It was a mistake.
Okay.
Look, um... why don't we go back upstairs
and collect some money?
Okay? Everyone wants to see you.
  Let's go.   You'll figure it out.
Conway called. He wanted to make a deal.
I'm sure that was enjoyable.
It will be even more so
once the Justice Department gets involved.
Is that the, uh...
Same model. Not the actual one.
  Surprised the Secret Service let   Well,
they removed the firing pin.
It's lighter than I imagined.
It's amazing something this small could do that much damage.
I was gonna bring it tomorrow,
but I think it might be too theatrical.
You want me to help you practice?
All right.
Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.
Good morning, Ms. Melman.
  No, what's her first name?   Julia.
  Use that.   We've never met before.
Remind her who the First Lady is.
Good morning, Julia.
Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.
Please, have a seat.
We want to be inclusive.
We'd like the NRA to work with us on getting this bill passed.
We have major support on both sides of the aisle.
Well, you do for now, but not for long.
You can have  kids massacred in a school shooting.
There's always the usual public outcry, demands for gun reform.
But a few months go by and people forget.
Well, this will move through Congress quickly.
We've got major support on both sides of the aisle.
Not enough to break a filibuster.
We'll drag this out till the election.
We'll tie up every other bill in the Senate.
Well, I've spoken to a lot of Senators and they  
No, don't get bogged down there.
Pivot right to the Supreme Court.
You plan on holding up the Supreme Court nomination, as well?
Unless you're going to nominate an NRA member.
  You know we can't do that.   Jacobs was unpredictable.
This time we're not taking any chances.
If you bring the government to a standstill,
we're gonna make this election about the NRA.
You can't match   million in ad buys.
Go for it. Flush your money down the drain.
The Democrats lost that battle decades ago.
And you'll lose it again.
The president never offered up one gun reform bill while he was whip.
Well, because it wasn't a top priority for him  
No, no, no, no, no. Make it, uh, stronger.
Say, uh, "The president took a bullet!" Make it personal.
I'm sorry your husband got shot.
But not enough to roll over.
Oh, we're not asking you to.
We're inviting you to be on the right side of history.
Yeah, that's good, but you wanna go in for the kill.
We want this woman storming out of that door,
foaming at the mouth.
All right. Don't disgrace yourself, Julia.
  Think about the future    No, tougher.
Stronger, tougher!
All right, what about...
Thirty years from now when you're dying in hospice care...
you can look back and be proud of all the lives you saved.
Or you can be forgotten...
clutching onto the past with your cold, dead hands.
I'll show myself out.
That's exactly the steel goddamn stomach I was talking about.
Was it Pete Dreyer?
Congressman Dreyer's been a mentor for years.
  He had no right to tell you.   He had every right.
If a member of the House Intelligence Committee
chooses to share information with me, he's at liberty to do so.
Our conversation was in confidence.
I don't feel comfortable with this.
The Congressman is just as frustrated as you are,
and he spoke to me because he wants to help.
And so do I, General.
Governor, I'm a soldier. I'm not going to play politics.
You played politics the moment you opened your mouth to Pete.
  Did you see my speech yesterday?   Yes, I did.
I meant every word of it.
Now, you and I have both fought for our country.
Underwood hasn't.
He has no idea. He doesn't understand.
And that's why I need to be president,
so we can strike when we need to strike.
Look, I can help you, but I need your help to do so.
I've never leaked classified information to the press. Not once.
My colleagues have. I haven't.
There's a better way.
You're not gonna like the sound of this at first,
but if you hear me out, we can fight back on this.
  General.   Mr. President.
You can take this back. I am not accepting your resignation.
Please, sit.
I fought in Lebanon, sir.
Commanded troops in Somalia,
in Bosnia, in both Gulf Wars, in Afghanistan.
I just don't wanna see us bogged down in another conflict like those.
ICO is the next Al Qaeda and Taliban.
And you accomplish nothing by resigning your commission.
We've accomplished nothing with your current policy.
You know, I just can't help but think that...
the timing of this, it's just a bit coincidental.
  Sir?   Well, Conway gave a big speech yesterday.
I mean, he made a big meal out of ICO, didn't he?
I suppose he realizes just how dangerous they are.
I wonder where he's getting that information.
I've no idea, sir.
I've never spoken to the man, nor would I.
It's classified.
And you're speaking from your conscience.
Yes, sir.
Conscience has an unmistakable stink to it,
sort of like raw onions and morning breath.
But a lie stinks even more
when it's coming from someone who isn't used to lying.
It's more like rotten eggs and horseshit.
  How soon can we move on this?   You want to conduct the mission?
Would it keep you from resigning?
Well, I  
I need your expertise and your experience,
and if both are telling me I'm wrong,
I'd rather trust your instincts than mine.
Do we still have an open window?
The gathering is set to end by tomorrow night.
Let me talk to the Chairman and the Secretary of Defense
  before I sign off on the order.   Of course, sir.
General, it takes a brave man to stand up to a president.
If you authorize the mission, we won't get our court ruling.
There is no way to justify
domestic surveillance once ICO is eliminated.
Which is fine, because media pressure is mounting.
Conway has no choice but to distance himself from Pollyhop.
We don't know how that's gonna play out.
Oh, I can tell you how Brockhart's resignation is gonna play out.
Thirty-second ads in every swing state.
A decorated war veteran
pulverizing us for being weak on national security.
Pollyhop is gonna pulverize us more than Brockhart ever could.
Not if Conway is busy fighting public outcry.
Think about the data they have already gathered.
When you sold us this, you said it was going to be a last resort,
not the only resort.
There is no risk in getting surveillance approved.
Then we either use it or we don't.
But if you order this strike, sir, we don't even have the option.
  You've met with him, Macallan.   Yes, sir.
  So, can he be trusted?   I honestly can't say.
He understands the risks even better than you do.
  I'm gonna authorize the strike.   Sir...
Your guy's an unknown.
  Brockhart isn't.   Ma'am...
  I agree with Francis.   Get me the Secretary of Defense.
I've asked Claire to join us today
because this directly affects
the legislation she's trying to get passed.
Your top three choices for running mate,
they're all tight with the gun lobby.
Mrs. Underwood...
You know everyone in this room agrees with the reforms you want,
but we're thinking about the general election,
and the NRA is a terrible enemy for us to make.
Yeah, now Whittaker's gonna focus on swing states, fundraising...
That's where I'll play the bad cop.
You play the worse cop. Then when we get them off balance...
You come back in again as the good cop.
Exactly. So I will start with...
Well, I feel that these choices send mixed messages.
We're for gun reform, they're not.
If both names on the ticket are gun-control fanatics,
then the whole election becomes about...
Get personal, the way you told me to with Melman.
One out of four presidents gets shot at.
One out of every ten dies from a bullet wound.
Better than that.
I saw Edward Meechum die before my very eyes.
  Good. You were lucky.   I'm lucky.
Statistics don't mean anything to these people.
They see this as a one-way road to confiscation.
I lose my seat in a heartbeat if I take this stance.
  Now, this is where I will play good cop.   Okay, so Birch goes,
"We're asking you to look at the bigger picture here, Mr. President."
You're right, Bob.
  Claire!   They're all right. They are.
My meeting with the NRA did not go well.
They're going to fight this tooth and nail.
Well, of course they are.
And... and the chances are the legislation won't pass.
Oh, it'll pass. Because you are going to push it
until it goes through both houses and gets on the books.
We may have support now...
But by the time this bill gets onto the floor...
You focus on the language, Congressman.
Leave convincing the American people to us.
Now, if you wanna work with us on this bill,
I can stomach a gun-friendly candidate.
What about you, Francis?
The kill.
Only on one condition, Claire.
I don't want us to work our asses off getting this bill passed
just to see it knocked down in the courts.
We don't have any control over that, sir.
We still need to fill Jacobs' seat.
If you can confirm an anti-gun justice,
I'll put a gun-lover on the ticket.
A Supreme Court confirmation in the middle of an election?
Oh, come on, grow a pair, Bob.
We're giving you what you want. Give us what we want.
Who are you thinking about?
Nobody followed you?
No one. I'm positive.
You know, sometimes I have a student and something seems off.
They look a little too old, you know? To be in college.
  What is that?   Xanax.
Lucas came up here.
To the campus.
He wanted my help and I said no.
Maybe if I had, he wouldn't have...
So stupid.
He got out.
Why did he do this?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
It's all true, Tom.
  How do you know?   Because I know.
Lucas didn't mention you in his suicide letter.
I'm sure it was to protect me.
If you have any proof, now's the time to share it.
If I did, do you think any of this would've happened?
  You could go on record    I signed an affidavit.
Anything I say now is worth shit.
That's probably why they've left me alone.
No, no. No. No more pills.
  Promise me you'll be careful.   I promise.
I would help if I could, I  
You just focus on taking care of yourself.
Come here. Come here.
Is there anything I can do to make you reconsider?
Yes, sir, I understand.
I'm pleased the strike's on, as well.
Thank you for the heads up. Bye.
Fuck!
  What's wrong?   He caved.
  The general?   Yes.
Daddy, when is it?
When is it? Ben?
I'm not sure about this, Will. Maybe we should cancel it.
My lawyers are saying it's a terrible idea.
If it's not us, it's the Justice Department.
  I've put everything into this company.   Just trust me on this.
Hey, Will.
  For my Insta.   Yeah.
Okay. Smile, Charlie.
Smile.
  All right.   Great.
Here we go.
You little...
Scoot over.
Are we all set?
Yes, sir. Ready whenever you are.
Here we go.
Okay.
You ready? You ready?
Yep.
Here we go.
Hello, America. I'm Will Conway,
Republican candidate for president,
and this is my son, Charlie.
You wanna say hi to everyone, Charlie?
A little hi. Can we get a little hi?
No? That's all we get? That's all we get.
And this is Hannah, my wife. And our little rascal Lily.
Well, she's not so little anymore,
but definitely still a rascal.
Aren't you, sweetheart?
And we are webcasting from our home here in Albany.
As you can see, we don't live in the governor's mansion.
We live in a regular house, just like many of you.
And this is our living room.
Hannah has decorated everything herself.
Well, except for the toys.
That's the... That's the kids' addition to the decor.
A lot of toys.
Now, many of you have seen or read in the news
rumors about my campaign teaming up with the search engine Pollyhop,
and I'd like to speak to you today about those rumors
because they're not rumors at all.
They're facts. One hundred percent accurate.
And here is my good friend Benjamin Grant.
He's the founder of Pollyhop,
and he's gonna tell you about our partnership.
Well, a lot of big companies stay out of politics.
They don't want to offend anyone. But not Pollyhop.
We're not shy about who we support,
and we're proud to support Will Conway.
He knows what this country needs and where it's going.
Now...
I realize this might scare a lot of people.
Do we know your personal information?
Can we see what you're searching for?
Are we reading your emails?
The answer is no. We're not tracking individuals.
We're looking at metadata,
large-scale browsing patterns, search trends, regional portraits.
'Cause Ben is right.
A president should know his constituents.
And the Internet is the best tool for that.
Now, I've met thousands of people and shaken a lot of hands,
but I can't meet everyone.
So this is my way of listening to millions of you.
Now, it's only fair if I get to know you better,
you should get to know me better.
So while I'm not reading your personal correspondence,
I want you to have access to mine.
So, from this point forward,
every email, text message, photo, or video
that I use on this phone,
you can see it all, including everything since I became governor.
Now, all you have to do is go into my campaign website at...
That's correct. And you'll find a link right there.
Our life is your life.
And your future is our future.
Thank you, and God bless America.
  That was good.   Yeah, that was good.
Well done. Well done.
You got it, Governor.
All right. Now we wait and see.
His honesty and openness have made quite an impact,
and America is paying attention.
Just three hours since Conway's webcast,
over two million people have visited his website...
The massive public interest has driven traffic to Pollyhop.Com.
Pollyhop CEO Benjamin Grant
is reporting three times its normal volume of searches.
All of the cell phone footage is on the Conway campaign website.
There's a ton of archived clips.
Some have already gone viral, including this one,
filmed just this morning,
of Conway with his gorgeous wife Hannah, so jealous,
and his totally adorable son Charlie.
Shave Mom's head, not mine!
Shave Mom's head?
  Okay.   No!
You guessed it. I still hate children.
People don't care about their privacy.
They want him to have access.
He's still breaking campaign finance regulations.
But he's getting good press,
not the public outcry we had hoped for.
You can't let the Justice Department investigate.
It'll backfire on us.
What you need to do is call off the air strike.
Sir, you've already signed the order.
We've got planes in the air.
My job is to win a campaign, I need to have  
  And my job is to protect the president.   Enough!
Jesus Christ.
Go. I need to speak with him.
What are you thinking?
That I was fine with this when it was just plan B,
but this is... domestic surveillance.
I mean, we don't even know this guy.
You're right, we don't know him. What we do know...
is we'll lose if we do nothing.
They're beautiful, aren't they? The Conways.
Their youth, their two little children.
The country is falling in love with them.
They won't fall in love with us like that,
but we have something they don't.
We are willing to go one step farther than everyone else.
General, a word.
We're approximately two hours out  
  Abort the mission.   Mr. President?
  I'm ordering you to abort.   But you said  
Don't make me say it a third time, and don't threaten to resign,
because I know you won't,
because you can't even fathom what it means to be a civilian.
  Execute my order.   Yes, sir.
  Sir.   It's done.
  Sir.   I aborted.
You're up late.
Go to Conway's website. December st, .
Hannah's last moments of .
Stop, I'm stuffing my face.
You're feeding a growing girl. Hello, little baby.
Yes, I am.
She's kicking like a maniac, too.
Will, please, stop.
  No, come on.   No.
You've got... You have... You have a little something...
Mr. Governor-elect.
Congressman, such an honor to meet you.
  Well, the honor is mine.   This is my wife, Hannah.
It's a pleasure. And this is Claire.
Hello.
  How far along are you?   Almost seven months.
Thank you so much for inviting us here.
This is a real treat for us.
Well, I'm glad you came.
I thought you'd be in Times Square tonight.
It's Governor De Luca's last year in office.
I thought he should have the spotlight to himself.
Well, that's very classy of you.
And I didn't wanna miss the chance to
make some new friends in Washington.
Well, that was a smart idea. Have you met Garrett, yet?
No. No, sir.
Well, come on. Ladies, we'll be back.
Mr. President-elect, Governor-elect Conway.
  Congratulations.   You, too, sir.
So here he is, the boy wonder. He isn't a myth after all.
More like a pariah.
  There's a lot of Democrats here.   Plenty of Republicans, too.
Frank made sure of that.
Well, if you wanna push the sludge through Congress,
it's best to have grease on both sides of the aisle.
Oh, I'm sorry, I have to go. It's almost time.
  Thank you for your service.   Thank you, sir.
So, is it true that you joined up a day after  ,
or is that just something you say?
  Within  hours, honest to God.   That's incredible.
I was , just out of law school.
You want a career in politics
and the Twin Towers fall in your lap?
Timing couldn't have been better.
Oh, I see how you won.
  Well, he must be on top of the world.   I... I can't imagine.
Oh, really? How old are you? Thirty-five?
Thirty-six.
Oh, you've never thought about it, late at night?
  The White House?   What else?
  Have you?   Haven't we all?
I'm in no rush. Who knows? Maybe, one day.
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln. Tall men make great presidents.
It's like you want me to run.
Oh, goodness, no. You running?
That would be a disaster for the Democrats.
  I better see my wife.   Ten...
  Me, too.   ...nine,
eight, seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
  That was before everything.   I know.
Francis, are you there?
We're going to destroy them.
Yes, we are.House.of.Cards.SE
I just love your writing, Tom,
ever since Scorpio.
I think it just gets better and better.
Oh, yeah? What else have you read?
All of them.
I thought the latest was brilliant, God's Cauldron.
  You read that?   In one sitting.
But what we'd really love to read
is your book on the Underwoods.
Well, it's changed. It's fiction now.
But based on them.
People might draw parallels.
Would the Underwoods find it flattering?
I don't think they'd be too happy with it.
How do you think it'll do?
  Who knows?   Better than God's Cauldron, I hope.
Sales were disappointing, weren't they?
In fact, they've been disappointing
on everything you've written the past ten years.
We can change that with this new book.
I'm not a political tool.
We didn't fly you up here because my wife's a fan.
I'm sure you had a notion of what we're after.
I didn't have any expectations.
I just came because I was curious.
Well, then let me satisfy your curiosity.
If your book can hurt the Underwoods,
we want it to be published before the election,
and we want it to be big.
Dana Treister, do you know her?
The editor of Vanity Fair.
That's right. She's a close friend.
And Ben Grant, founder of Pollyhop.
I saw the webcast.
They don't manipulate search results,
but let's just say a big spread in Vanity Fair...
Nice juicy excerpt,
profile on Thomas Yates, his literary comeback.
We're on the cover this month, but... next month it could be you.
I'm on the Marxist side of Democrat.
Why would I help a Republican?
You'd be helping yourself, Tom.
And if that helps us a little bit along the way,
what's the harm in that?
Senator Dean Austen of Ohio,
the leadership's top choice for running mate.
Twelve years in Congress,
helps us with a major swing state,
middle of the road, very few enemies,
and most importantly to them, long-time friend of the NRA.
Now his shortcomings are he's another middle-aged white guy,
underwhelming, unimaginative
and a long-time friend of the NRA.
So you can see how I feel about the leadership's choice.
Senator.
I'm honored, Mr. President.
I just have one major reservation.
  Claire.   Yes, sir.
Well, between you and me,
I'm not even sure this gun bill is gonna pass.
But if I'm being asked to support it,
you know the sort of hot water  
Yes, but I need you on the ticket
to balance our stance on guns.
We have to appeal to the Republicans as well.
And look, I'm not asking you to get behind the bill,
just not to publicly trash it.
I know this is an important issue to you.
It is important,
but not as much as an experienced
leader who can deliver Ohio.
Then consider me on board, sir.
We're not sure we can get this to the floor before the election.
That's the deal we made.
You get Austen, we get the gun bill.
We need a strong Senate version first,
so we don't have two weak bills going into reconciliation.
You want Austen, you will make this bill a reality.
Or, we can revisit the choice for running mate.
No... let us see what we can do.
I'll call Mitchell.
Gentlemen,
the future vice president.
  Congratulations, Dean.   Thank you very much.
  Welcome.   Thank you. Mrs. Underwood.
  Nice to meet you.   Very nice to meet you.
So, how's it going in here?
Well, I think we're in alignment. Wouldn't you say?
It's been a productive meeting.
So, let's talk about when we should announce.
I, uh, I need to soften the blow to the NRA
before we go public.
It's imperative we keep a lid on this.
No leaks until we're ready.
Just the four of us in this room.
And Claire, of course.
Well, I need to go do this quick interview.
Um, let me know how it goes with Mitchell.
All right, I'm sure you have some  
Oh, leave that open. It gets so stuffy in here.
Let's discuss the timing.
Was it you or the First Lady?
  First Lady all the way.   She thinks she can win me over?
She knows you'll hit harder than anyone else.
If she's still standing by the end, maybe the bill has sea legs.
  Kate.   Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.
How about we talk in the Roosevelt Room?
Support in the House is already wavering.
The public's losing interest in guns.
Don't you want to wait until we sit down?
Your staff only scheduled an hour. I want to make the most of it.
Oh, it's being used.
Let's find somewhere else.
Kate?
Well, historically, gun reform comes and goes in waves,
as you know, so I believe this time, it can be truly different.
All the data's filtered here, within these walls.
My analysts do a first pass, but ultimately,
I do the final round myself.
Our biggest concern is security.
Top-grade firewall, same as you guys use at NSA headquarters.
What about internal security?
I'm the only one with full access.
So, if you do find anything,
how do you communicate that to us in a secure way?
In person.
I'll come to Fort Meade myself, or you come here.
No hardware leaves the premises.
Can you walk us through how the filtering algorithms work?
We'll take firearms, for instance.
If we start with everyone who legally owns a gun,
track geo-location patterns through their phones,
we start to put together a portrait
of where gun-owners live, eat, shop, everything.
From this, we predict everyone who might want a firearm,
but who isn't registered.
They're likely to exhibit the same behavior as people who are.
You can use that for people who are interested in Arabic,
uh, wanna travel to the Middle East,
who are disillusioned with the U.S. Government...
So the same techniques that
we're using for our international surveillance.
Yes...
but far more advanced.
Okay, turn a little bit towards me, Mrs. Conway.
Right.
You look great, Hannah.
  What about the candidate?   Don't get me started, Will.
  You're really photogenic.   I know.
Franny Wallace, senior year.
  The all-Goldfish diet.   Did you have these put here specially?
We roll out the platinum carpet, darling.
I wonder what Franny's up to now.
Hmm, not the Editor of Vanity Fair, I'll tell you that.
Or about to be the First Lady.
Come a long way, haven't we?
Yeah, Will and I, um... Will and I appreciate your doing this.
It's not charity.
This issue will sell like crazy with you two on the front.
Well, I feel like I should return the favor.
A night in the Lincoln Bedroom?
A story.
You have a copy for me?
An excerpt.
  I need the whole book.   That's all you get.
Conway got the same thing.
  That was a mistake, Tom.   They came to me.
But they don't get to publish... without my approval.
So what do you want?
  A meeting.   For?
You're just a messenger, Doug.
You got your message.
One week.
Thanks for the coffee.
Mrs. Underwood, welcome.
Thank you so much for recording this robocall.
It'll go a long way in getting this bill passed.
Well, thank you for all the extraordinary work you're doing.
Uh, where would you like me?
Uh, Sally will show you where we set up for the recording.
Right this way, Mrs. Underwood.
LeAnn...
What is that?
Names, phone numbers, emails.
A quarter million fresh targets.
A quarter million? Where'd you get this?
No return address.
It's  times the names that we have.
Is it legit?
Looks like it. We made sample calls.
Hello, this is Claire Underwood.
I need to confess something...
something I'm not proud to confess.
When I was sitting beside my husband in the hospital...
all I thought about was me.
My fear. My pain if I was to lose him.
And it was selfish.
I   I wasn't thinking about everyone else
who had gone through that fear and pain,
who had to sit where I was sitting
because a loved one was shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun.
I'm ashamed because I've never done anything about it.
I'm ashamed of how many lives we could've saved.
How many families we could've kept from suffering.
We should all be ashamed, every one of us,
because the blood is on all of our hands,
and doing nothing is the same as pulling a trigger.
We need to do something.
And that means changing the law.
Senator Austen's office.
More than  since this afternoon.
From our district?
We have it light.
I'm hearing that other offices have gotten over a thousand.
Senator Austen's office. I will take a message.
Francis.
You really shouldn't.
Oh, one won't kill me.
Did you finish it?
Yeah.
One part really caught my eye.
"A chasm opened up between them,
a hallway less than ten yards wide.
But it might as well have been a thousand miles.
A well-appointed no man's land
with a plush carpet and high ceiling between two bedrooms.
In it were two centuries of ghosts,
all the Presidents and First Ladies before them.
But also the ghost... of their marriage.
A thirty years' war that left them both dead inside
and this dead space between them."
He's perceptive.
Uncanny.
Well, it's not who we are. Not anymore.
People will want to believe it's true even if it's false.
What do you think it is he wants to accomplish?
He came here one night, after I'd asked you to resign.
He said he was obsessed.
Or maybe he wants back in.
You felt something for him.
Maybe for a moment.
  Did you?   No, I don't think so.
I felt...
I felt like he saw me.
Me, too.
Mr. Barnes.
I couldn't stop thinking, since you called...
about Zoe.
  I guess I want answers.   That   That's what I want, too.
  What is it you want to know?   Was there... a relationship?
With Underwood?
When she was , just before she went off to school...
she found out I was having an affair.
Sales rep, some drug company.
Blonde. You know.
This isn't, you know, on the record.
No... No, not if you don't want it to be.
You said she found out.
She gave me three days to tell her mother, or she would...
I'm sorry, I had a few drinks.
  Did you tell her?   Yeah, I told her.
We split up.
Zoe didn't talk to me much after that.
I don't know anything about Underwood.
I'm the last person she would've told.
I wish I would've... made more of an effort...
to reach out to her.
Are you driving, Mr. Barnes?
Yeah.
  I'm almost home.   You should pull over.
Did you find out anything?
Anything you can tell me?
She didn't have a lot of friends at the Herald.
Um, from what I can gather,
she didn't have any close friends at all.
I spoke to some people in her neighborhood...
but nothing so far.
Will you?
  If you...   Yeah, of course, of course.
If you think of anything...
Yeah.
Then what were you doing there?
If I do a meeting at the White House,
I don't have to explain myself, Julia.
This bill might pass.
  I realize that.   Are you helping them?
Absolutely not.
  Julia.   Mrs. Underwood.
Sorry, I'd shake your hand, but I just got back from a run.
Listen, I wanted to say,
I know our meeting last time didn't go very well,
and that's on me. It was rude, what I said,
and I hope you'll accept my apology.
Have a seat, please.
You ever been in the residence before?
The personal touch isn't going to bring me on board.
Neither will a few thousand calls to Congress.
But let's put that aside for a moment
  and talk about your good friend.   Who?
  Senator Austen.   He told me. Running mate.
Oh, not just running mate.
You said I wouldn't have to support this bill.
Yes, but a lot can change in a day, Dean.
We had no idea there'd be this sort of groundswell.
Julia Melman was all over
my ass even for being in the same room as you.
Did you tell her?
  I had to.   Christ, Dean...
It was that, or make an enemy for life.
She's upset, but I think she'll come around,
unless you make me endorse
closing the gun show and Internet loopholes.
Then she'll go ballistic.
Dean wouldn't do that. We've poured millions into his campaigns.
And now he doesn't need you anymore.
Are you trying to intimidate me? To get us to back down?
No, I have an offer.
Ohio's a tough state for Democrats.
Julia's been very good to me.
Loyalty's important, I understand,
but your loyalty has to be with me now.
I just can't do it.
All right, then we'll cancel the announcement.
I'll find someone else to be my running mate.
No, I mean, I... I just can't support this bill.
Oh, but you see, the two go hand in hand now.
So, are you on the ticket or not?
What if the gun bill passes in the House, but not the Senate?
In return for what?
You convince the senator to pull out.
Now, the leadership wants him, and we've played nice,
but the president and I want Cathy Durant.
She's a much stronger candidate.
You're willing to abandon your own bill?
If it's means beating Conway or beating you,
that's not a hard choice.
I already told Dean that
I could live with him being running mate.
How do I backtrack?
Just watch the news tomorrow.
You made the right choice.
  I hope so.   Well, don't hope so, know so.
And I'll have Seth send you a copy of the speech.
You can show the senator out now, thank you.
Yes, sir.
  Oh, I'm sorry.   It's okay. Come in.
  What did he say?   He'll do it. What did she say?
That she'll think about it.
How do we know she won't tell him our plans?
I told her if she does,
we'll make sure the bill goes through the Senate.
Can you hand me a towel, please?
  Meechum's hand.   What?
I traced it on a wall downstairs... A while back.
They've painted over it. Oh, never mind.
Francis, I've been thinking about Yates.
The Conways have everything.
They have their children, their videos, their Twitter.
There are very few people who understand us.
Meechum... was one.
Tom is another.
Eight...
Seven. Nice.
Mr. Long Pants.
Mr. Nice Shoes. Go! Go, go, go.
  Go!   Are you hungry?
No money. You need to go. You and your money, go.
  I'm calling the cops.   All right, all right.
  The cops, right now...   All right, all right.
  I'm calling the cops.   All right, all right.
Ma'am...
I'm Officer Tom.
You called for me?
There was a man here.
A very bad man.
  Do you live on this block?   Thirty-three years.
Did you ever see this bad man on your block?
Did you ever see this bad man on your block?
All right.
What about this woman? Did you ever see her?
  Pretty.   Yes, yes, she is.
Whore!
  Go away!   Why'd you say that?
  Go away. Go away.   Why'd you say that? Tell me.
Tell Officer Tom. Why did you call her that word?
Go away!
Built this myself, with my son.
He's doing El Capitan next spring.
Free-climb.
I feel like running for president
is like climbing a cliff without a safety rope.
How is it the press don't know you're here, by the way?
Just like you, General,
I take Sundays off to spend time with family and friends.
Or to make new friends.
Look, Governor, I know you still want me to resign.
But I was wrong to threaten that.
Dreyer told me ICO took over another oil field this week.
They're growing.
Dreyer shares a lot with you, doesn't he?
This is happening on your watch, General.
The president isn't acting and you can't force him to.
Not if you stay.
If you resign, though, I promise it'll only be temporary.
Once I get political, I can't cross back over the line.
I don't mean a recommission.
I mean making you my running mate.
Thank you.
  Have you read it?   Just an excerpt. It's powerful.
And it'll be controversial. Say yes and I'll show you.
The Telegraph would never let me.
  Same parent company, both our titles.   Doesn't matter.
Paper is strict when it comes to moonlighting.
It does matter, because my dad is on the board.
One call to your editor...
There... there are plenty of people who would jump at doing this.
Not who know him intimately.
My new election correspondent,
he saw you and Yates sneaking off on the campaign trail.
Yates will open up to you.
I'm sure you know what buttons to push.
It's a conflict of interest.
My dad showed me that article you wrote.
The one that never went to print where you called him a tyrant.
Some of us have built our careers on our reputations,
not by having their daddies give them a magazine to play with.
Or by cozying up to old school chums, right?
I've heard it all before.
You may not like me, you may not like the Conways,
but I have to believe you can stomach us better
than another four years of President Underwood.
  Well, the writing is good.   I know.
Not good enough to strong-arm a president.
Well, good enough to get me in this room.
I thought Francis made it very clear to you,
you were not to challenge us.
Yeah. He said he would tell the world
I didn't write Scorpio.
I hope you understand
that we can't allow you to print this before the election.
I do.
Then why did you want to meet?
I need an ending.
I have one I can live with, but not the one I love.
  Because it's false.   Well, it's true that you left.
If I left, I wouldn't be here.
I don't believe for a second
you went to visit your mother because she was sick.
And why is that?
Because you never mentioned her one time to me.
Saying nothing says a lot sometimes.
Well, what if the story isn't about how she left,
but how she came back.
Just because you're here doesn't mean you're here.
Well, wouldn't you like to know?
Don't you want your ending?
Are you gonna tell me about it?
About the two of you? No lies.
No, I'm not going to tell you anything.
You can observe, like you did before.
The difference is everything you see this time will be yours.
And in return, we would like something.
Speeches. We need someone who knows us...
and knows our voices.
A speechwriter? You're kidding.
It's the only way to justify you being with us...
in case the press ask.
You want to keep an eye on me.
Well, I think that's fair. Don't you?
If you're keeping an eye on us?
So you gave us a week. We'll give you a day.
It was right here, on this very spot,
that I was shot with two bullets
from an illegally obtained handgun.
Secret Service Agent Edward Meechum,
a marine and my friend,
was slain with the bullets from that very same gun.
The public support...
for the First Lady's... Universal Background Check Bill
has been deafening in these last few days.
We have heard from thousands and thousands of voices,
and today, we would like to add one more voice to that chorus.
And it is a powerful voice.
Senator Dean Austen of Ohio.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I've been a member of the NRA since I was a teenager.
I've always been a fierce advocate for gun rights.
But today I want to offer my strong support
for the First Lady's bill.
Here you go.
  Let me ask you another question.   I'm tellin' you, man,
if you say she lived on the block, I believe you.
But she must not have liked pizza,
'cause I don't remember ever seein' her face.
Not her. President Underwood.
Oh, Christ, I can't get away from this guy.
His wife just called me. Robocall about guns.
You ever seen him around this neighborhood?
Oh, yeah. All the time.
With the Queen of England, Friday nights, after bowling.
When he was in Congress.
Nah, never once.
I would've remembered. I'm good with faces.
  Parmesan?   Over there.
I saw this guy a few times, though.
  The senator?   No, the, uh, the dead guy.
The Secret Service guy.
In here?
Yeah, a while back. He used to stop in for coffee.
Never any pizza, just coffee.
  You're positive?   Yeah. I told you, I'm good with faces.
"The wheels lifted, and within seconds,
Washington fell away, disappearing under a blanket of haze and smog.
Forehead pressed to the window,
she imagined this was exactly
how it must have looked a thousand years ago,
when the sun rose above the clouds
and there was nothing but a swamp beneath.
From this height, with this view,
she could be anywhere.
But the important thing is she was anywhere but there."
  You want another?   Yeah.
Did he say why?
Okay, thanks, Dana.
Yates pulled out.
Said he came to an agreement with the Underwoods.
He was playing us off each other.
We could still leak the excerpt.
It's too risky. If we get away with it, great.
If we don't,
we look like opportunists fucking over an acclaimed novelist.
It's not worth it.
Do you think it's true, that chasm between them?
Who knows?
I love that writing.
  I wish I could've read the rest of it.   I hated Scorpio.
  It was beautiful.   It's garbage.
  Why?   The main character's a pussy.
  Will, you know I hate that word.   He is.
He lets his best friend kill himself. He does nothing?
He was in pain. He was going to die anyway.
It doesn't matter. It's cowardly.
I think he was brave. And his friend.
And I think Yates was brave to write it.
Brave is never giving up. You fight, no matter what.
So, Kate Baldwin was willing if Yates was in?
Yeah, Dana was giving her , words.
I think we can pivot.
How?
Get her back on the phone.
  Julia.   Olivia, I didn't know you were in town.
Oh, just a little visit.
I miss seeing Dean's face sometimes. Don't tell him that.
  Will you give us a few minutes?   No, she should stay.
Oh, I know you have things to discuss.
Like your husband withdrawing from the ticket.
That's why she's in town, right? For the announcement.
I know the press conference must've caught you off guard,
but the president didn't want you to know.
  He thought you'd organize a protest.   He was right. I would've.
My plan was to sit down, talk this out before the announcement.
There isn't gonna be an announcement.
You... you can't waltz in here  
We've raised   million
for your husband since he was a freshman.
That gives me the right to waltz in whenever I want.
  Show some respect.   Honey, please.
No. This is what we wanted.
  What we've worked for.   When Underwood loses,
you'll spend the next two years fighting off a primary opponent.
Every one of our , members in Ohio will turn on you.
By the time you've lost this office,
Olivia's law firm will go tits up.
Don't forget, we pushed most of your clients your way.
He got cold feet. What can I do?
Convince him to change his mind.
He wouldn't listen. He says the NRA came down hard on him.
Because you had him do the press conference.
No, that was Austen's idea, not mine.
I told him to lay low,
but he said if he was in, he wanted to be all in.
The idea was to balance the ticket.
Well, we can't do anything about Austen.
The question now is who do we get to replace him?
Go back to the list?
He was fine, but I'm not enthused by anyone else on that list.
Let's not go back to square one, Mr. President.
We have a good list.
Everybody can get behind those names.
It's common sense.
The only problem with common sense is that it's so... common.
I think we can do better.
Who?
Cathy Durant.
Now, Louisiana's not a swing state, I know that.
But she is still a national figure,
she helps us with the women's vote,
and I trust her.
What about guns?
I don't think she's ever had a strong position.
It's better than that. She's never uttered a word on the issue.
We checked.
  I like it.   So do I.
  But I had another thought.   Who?
Not "Who." How.
I don't think I should choose her.
I think the party should choose her.
Not an open convention.
Look, Bob, let's...
We have to face the fact that
my health is gonna be a major liability for us.
No matter who becomes the running mate,
they could well end up being president.
Now, that is a...
a scenario that I don't even like to fathom,
but we can't escape it.
And if it's such an important decision,
why not let the party make it?
Because it'd be a free-for-all.
No, no. We make it so that Cathy wins.
We'll just make it look like the party chose her.
And think of the coverage. We'll own the news.
You want the convention to be a circus.
Oh, Bob, I'm not sure if you've noticed or not,
but politics is no longer just theater, it's show business.
So let's put on the best show in town.
Great.
Will you give me a salute, General?
Active military aren't allowed to speak to the press.
He delivered his resignation this morning.
No shit.
We're gonna break it online as soon as the president accepts it.
Not often a monthly gets raw meat like this, huh?
His phone's gonna blow up.
But you get the exclusive.
  Sorry about Tom.   I'm not.
Thank you, General.
All right, we're gonna go set up for the...
Good afternoon, General. Kate Baldwin.
Shall we?
So, the main issue that Mrs. Underwood
has been focusing on is guns, obviously.
We've got some talking points we've been using,
  so you'll want to...   I'm sorry, is there any water?
Yes.
I'm a bit hungover.
At least I'm not still drunk.
Want some?
Uh, we're fine.
Right.
So...
to the talking points.
What is it?
Excuse me for a moment, gentlemen.
What I want to communicate mostly is about the death toll,
with personal stories, things that connect with  
Claire.
  Tom.   Mr. President.
Can we speak?
I'll, uh... I'll leave you to it.
Does she actually give a shit about guns?
What's that got to do with anything?
We knew this was a possibility.
He's gonna make a lot of noise. It's Conway, I'm sure of it.
Problem isn't Conway, it's LeAnn.
She pressured us to cancel the air strike.
We chose our path, Doug. Let's not second-guess it.
No offense, Mrs. Underwood, but she's doing damage.
I think we should replace her.
She's the reason we're gonna pass the gun bill.
Sir? I just got this from Dana Treister,
the editor of Vanity Fair.
Not sure what it means...
He's gonna make that son of a bitch his running mate.
  What's goin' on?   I'll see what I can dig up on him.
No. He was fully vetted
when he was commissioned for the Joint Chiefs.
No, you go with Seth and draft a statement on the resignation.
  Yes, sir. Let's go.   What's going on, Doug?
And it's LeAnn's fault.
He never would've resigned if it wasn't for her.
See what you can find.
On the general? The president said we shouldn't.
On LeAnn.
Hey, I don't wanna get involved in some cage match  
I thought we had an understanding. Your obedience.
I'll see what I can do.
Do you agree with Doug? You're having reservations about LeAnn?
Less about her and more about Tom.
But I told you I trust you on this, so I'm trusting you.
  Has the leadership agreed yet?   They're skeptical.
We can use this.
Well, gentlemen, if there was
any doubt about an open convention, let it go,
because we're gonna wanna bury this news.
Brockhart has just resigned.
And the general is about to appear on the cover of Vanity Fair.
Imagine what Conway can do with that.
Conway! Conway! Conway!
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming. Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you for coming out.
  Dana just sent me this.   So great to see you.
The story broke.
  Hello.   Isn't my wife perfect?
Thank you.
Let her know how perfect you think she is!
Stop it.
You're too much!
  Thank you! Thank you!   Conway! Conway! Conway!
Yeah, I know, Fausto.
I get exhausted just thinking about it, too.
All right.
A journey of a thousand miles.House.of.Cards.SE
Kentucky, you have  votes.
How do you cast them?
Madam Secretary,
as a senator for the great Commonwealth of Kentucky,
I'm proud to speak on behalf of the delegation's chair.
The Commonwealth of Kentucky,
home of the Derby, the Wildcats,
and the birthplace of bourbon,
for Vice President of the United States,
casts  votes for Secretary of State Catherine Durant...
and Congresswoman Sharon Pierce of California,
and  vote for the First Lady of these United States,
Mrs. Claire Underwood.
Louisiana, you have  votes.
How do you cast them?
Isn't this exciting? You can feel the electricity.
Been a very long time since an open convention.
I'm surprised you didn't get a few votes yourself, Senator.
I'm not running for vice president.
Neither is Claire Underwood and she got one.
That was my vote.
Trying to throw some levity into the proceedings, sir?
Hell, no! I think she'd make a terrific vice president.
Mrs. Underwood! Mrs. Underwood!
A couple of questions, Mrs. Underwood, if you have a moment?
Yes, I only have time for a few.
Welcome to Atlanta, Mrs. Underwood.
Thank you.
Can you comment on Senator Sheer's vote?
Well, I am flattered. But it's all in good fun, I'm sure.
Mrs. Underwood, he says he'll vote for you again.
Well, I am encouraging everyone, including Senator Sheer,
to vote for Cathy Durant.
Both the president and I
think she is the best choice in the field.
You changed everything we wrote.
There was no imagination to it. No rhythm.
We've been writing their speeches since they took office.
We know what we're doing.
Well, do you want it to be good, or do you want it to be yours?
The vote I'm most excited about
is the victory our
Background Check Legislation got in the House yesterday.
So I'm hoping that the Senate will follow their lead soon,
and that the president can sign it into law.
I have to go. Thank you so much.
Thank you... for inviting us.
No.
It's me who has to thank you and your son.
He saved my life.
No matter how tragic the circumstances.
I want you to meet some of the other recipients.
This is James... who received one of your son's kidneys.
And this is Luisa...
who received your son's heart.
Luisa was at the top of the list.
She was hours away from dying.
Uh, if we could, let's all get together for a photo.
James? Right here.
  You come right here.   Okay.
This way. Great.
The president isn't shying away from, uh, his transplant.
Well, I think it's a smart move.
You can't deny it, so why try to hide it?
Plus, I think it underscores the importance
of the vice presidential situation.
Wait, rolling out the donor's mom? That feels a bit exploitative.
I... Look, hold on.
A little bit of compassion, the kid just shot himself.
And with a handgun, no less.
Legally purchased. Let's not put this on the gun.
Look, I am sorry, all of this, the whole thing,
the convention... It's theatrics.
Hey, look, I... bring on the circus.
It's a lot more fun than some four-day infomercial.
Let's talk about the contenders themselves.
There's almost a dozen of 'em.
  Can you, uh, lower that, please?   ...really have a chance.
Durant, first among 'em.
It's : in the morning, day one,
and they're beating Ellen.
Less traffic on the website, too.
People aren't watching the videos as much.
This sold over a million copies.
Five times that many read it online.
Yeah, well, that was last month. This is this month.
We announce a stellar running mate.
He eviscerates Underwood on ICO.
We have not one, but two
Vanity Fair covers that Pollyhop's pushing,
and all you give me is excuses.
The point was for us to drown out their convention,
not the other way around. We need to steal the thunder back.
So go where the thunder is.
I've been one heartbeat away for almost two years.
My heart's not in it anymore.
I'm going to head back to Vermont after November.
Maybe start teaching again.
Who are you supporting, then?
On the record, Cathy Durant.
And off the record?
I'm not the biggest fan.
Why?
She wasn't much help during the Russia crisis.
She closed the deal with Petrov.
She took credit for it, sure.
But she fought the deal every step of the way.
Nothing would've happened if it weren't for Claire.
The First Lady?
The former ambassador.
We're closer in Kansas, but still not close enough.
Did you speak to Jefferies
when you were there for the House vote?
He's leaning on Fred Simms.
If Simms could deliver two or three delegates  
That could push Kansas over the edge.
I can call Womack.
He's got some friends over the border.
  What about Pawley?   Pawley?
Sheriff Pawley in Fort Worth, old family friend of my dad's.
He's close with some superdelegates from Dallas.
Yes, he's on board.
Gotta love those sheriffs.
That's how we do in Louisiana.
What about Enright?
I'm meeting him for coffee at the Hyatt.
In fact, I better get going. I don't wanna be late.
Now, if we could lock up Virginia  
It would send a very big message.
And then Kentucky next.
He's got a big old crush on you.
We better get you on a move.
Enright is a stickler for punctuality.
You know, I'm having fun. I forgot how much I miss being whip.
You whip 'em. I'll sweet talk 'em.
Nothing like leather and sugar.
Sir?
Senator Sheer.
Senator, you did a fine job.
Yeah, I better get prime time,
not one of these midmorning speeches.
Eight o'clock, Wednesday night. I called Patti myself.
Do you know the main thing that separates
a politician from the rest of the species?
A politician is the one who would drown a litter of kittens
for ten minutes of prime time.
Secretary Durant. Editor in chief, Politico.
It's all right.
Adam, are you covering this yourself?
First open one since '.
It's humid as hell, though.
I just got here and I'm already soaked.
On the plus side,
I hear they have the best strip clubs in the country.
Can I ask you a couple questions?
  Well, I'm in a hurry.   Just a couple.
Nothing on the record.
Tell me about the rumors
regarding the deal you struck with Petrov in Brandenburg.
What rumors?
That it was the First Lady who brokered the deal, not you.
It was a team effort. Who is your source?
I can't. You know that.
Well, I'm afraid that's all the time I've got.
Have a good trip, Adam.
The president was on site this morning for a press briefing
at the Truxton Marquis with Karen Williams,
the mother of Daniel Williams,
the organ donor who provided his liver.
Alongside him were all of the donor organs' recipients.
Ms. Williams took time to speak with each recipient
whose life was saved in the wake of her son's passing.
The president used this solemn event
to express his gratitude for those who share their lives
for the health and welfare of others,
whether through organ donation or through their work.
The president's condition has improved dramatically
since his organ donation.
The entire country was on edge
throughout his time in the hospital.
Sixteen-year-old Daniel,
who saved President Underwood from his health crisis,
left this world by
giving back to so many others he never expected to touch.
Lasting tributes like this will not be forgotten.
Currently, there are more than , men, women and children
seeking an organ transplant each year,
most common needs being the kidney, liver, and heart.
And while the number of donors has increased over the years,
recipients are still in for a long, potentially fatal waiting period
before a healthy, matching organ becomes available.
Waiting lists for these types of transplants
can last from days to months on end.
Although President Underwood's critical condition
pushed him to the top of the donor list,
he was fortunate to have received a donation in time.
Many status one, or most in-need patients
do not receive a transplant in time to save their lives.
Tennessee! You have  votes.
How do you cast them?
From the Volunteer State...,
the president will be with you in a moment.
...we cast  votes for vice president
to Secretary Catherine Durant,
and four votes to Senator Joseph Baker.
  Cathy!   The meeting with Enright went well.
I put a call into him afterwards. He said you charmed him.
  That puts us where?   Nine-forty-nine.
We won't make this ballot, but we're getting close.
Next one. I'm sure of it.
Let's talk once we get the final numbers.
Will do. Bye.
Texas, you have  votes.
Do you have my call list for tonight?
How do you cast them?
Madam Secretary, my name is Ruiz Trejo.
I see. Uh, I ran into Giovanni in the elevator.
You can cross him off.
And cross off Milford.
She said she's gonna back Baker till the bitter end.
We cast all of our votes to our native daughter,
the First Lady,
and the future Vice President of the United States of America,
Claire Underwood.
Thank you, Texas. And thank...
All ? Nice.
My mother brought the hammer down on the holdouts.
I just emailed you my donor lists for Austin and Houston.
Should be at least two million in the bank.
  Ms. Jones.   Oh, that's great.
Oh, I gotta go. The cameras are here.
Ms. Jones, the entire state for the First Lady.
Will you comment?
I think our unanimous vote is all the commentary you need.
Now, the president endorsed your race, uh,
your mother's vacant seat, uh, during the State of the Union.
He sure did, and I'm proud to be the front-runner.
Did that endorsement have anything to do
with your support of the First Lady?
Look, I won't deny that the Underwoods have been good to me.
But no. They asked me to vote for Catherine Durant.
And while I think Secretary Durant
would be a wonderful woman for the job,
I think Claire is the best woman for the job.
Well, I really appreciate it, Diane,
and I know Cathy will as well.
All right, we'll speak soon.
New draft.
LeAnn wanted me to work in some phrases...
and keyword amplifiers.
All I'm asking is that you make the call.
He'll listen if it comes from you.
It seems very clunky.
I agree.
Is there a way to...
put in what she wants and make it...
  more elegant?   He's still pissed about
that limp-dick defense bill I killed when I was whip...
Maybe... but I have my limitations.
Well, you don't have much faith in her analytics, I don't think.
It's paint by numbers.
Yes, well, she also says
that you've been alienating some of the other speechwriters.
Eh, well, their mediocrity is what's alienating them.
I'm allergic to it.
  I work better alone.   Let me speak to Bryce
and then see what I can do.
That's right. WestCAM should do it.
Well, tonight if you can.
The morning is fine if you can't...
I have to go. Let's discuss the speech later.
Yeah, all I need is just three more from your state
and we've got it.
Yes, just a... just a few more.
Like, three.
Yes, and so do I. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Good night.
Tom.
I feel like we haven't even had a chance to say hello
since you came on board.
You're a busy man.
I don't know the opposite.
It has its upsides. Like sleep.
And friends.
How's the, uh...
You know, if it weren't for the pills,
I could go through entire days without even thinking about it.
I wonder what that kid would think...
if he knew that part of him was inside of the president's body.
Tragic, huh?
But, then again,
one man's tragedy is another man's treasure,
  isn't that right?   Trash.
What?
"One man's trash." That's how the saying goes.
Oh, right.
How's the speech coming?
Well, this is for the introduction to your acceptance speech, but...
shouldn't it be for her own acceptance?
You want Claire to win, not Durant.
A First Lady as the...
That's ludicrous.
I don't think so.
And I don't think you do either.
Maybe I'm wrong.
But if I'm right...
she's gonna need the speech to end all speeches.
And it would be good for me to know that.
I have some more work to do.
Governor! How are you?
Yeah, well, I wish I was in Oregon, too,
but I'm here in Atlanta
where it's muggier than a street hooker's twat.
I am honored to be mentioned
with Secretary Durant and Senator Baker.
They're seasoned politicians.
But I already have a job,
First Lady of the United States.
Well, Texas is over   of the vote.
And my home state, so let's not make more of it than it is.
Claire!
Congratulations. I think you're in fifth place now.
Yeah, with you in first, where you should be.
Secretary Durant, do you think the First Lady has a shot?
I think Texas just gave her one.
Kidding aside, do you think
she has the foreign policy experience?
It's beside the point. And like I said this morning,
I encourage everyone, including Texas,
to vote for Secretary Durant.
Mrs. Underwood  
You know what, if you'll excuse me,
I want to get back to the phones,
make sure Cathy gets this nomination.
  Thank you.   May I have a moment?
Oh, of course.
Did anyone ask you about Brandenburg
or any of your people and your involvement there?
Brandenburg?
No, we put that to bed.
That's what I thought,
which is why I was surprised when Adam Gould told me
that he had sources saying you deserved all the credit.
We all agreed to what our version of the story is,
so somebody isn't toeing the line.
Well, I'm sure it's not White House staff.
I bet he's just fishing, trying to start some rivalry.
Well, I'd be grateful, if he asks you, or anyone else  
Of course. And I've been sticking to our story...
which it was you that got the Russians to back down,
and I was just there to support you.
That wouldn't look good to the delegates,
the fact that you met with Petrov without me.
It would look like I wasn't in command of  
No one needs to know what we discussed.
You have nothing to worry about, Cathy. Honestly.
Well, yeah. I can get you on the phone
with the Secretary of Agriculture,
but if you want drought relief,
I'm gonna need more than just Stevens and Lopez.
Has anything been set up with Baker yet?
Tomorrow morning, in his room.
Well, that's cutting it close.
He's at a big dinner with
the Florida congressional delegation tonight.
Well, all right, and call me back.
The rumors have gotten to Cathy.
Well, we did want them to spread. That was the idea.
I think one of us needs to speak with her.
Yeah, but the plan was to wait till it was inevitable.
If we don't involve her sooner than later, Francis,
she could turn on us.
All right, you take your meeting with Baker.
  I'll talk to Cathy. You set that up.   Yes, sir.
How much are you going to say?
Just enough to prepare her.
A lot of calls about Mrs. Underwood in Russia.
Denying?
Ignoring, which is the same as confirming.
  Good.   Claire in there?
She's speaking privately with the president.
Oh, I'm sure she won't mind.
Where are we with LeAnn?
  She's clean.   No.
I refuse to believe that.
Doug, if our campaign manager bites the dust,
that hurts us.
I gave you a task.
And I'll keep at it.
Nice coverage on the liver thing this morning.
I emailed you some links.
Boys are older now, both married.
Got a third grandkid on the way.
We don't get out to the lake much these days.
Washington takes its toll.
It sure does.
I've made a lot of sacrifices over the years, Mrs. Underwood.
Time with my boys, that's a big one.
Who knows if I'll win, but I'm in the mix.
And I can't sacrifice this opportunity
to pave the way for Cathy Durant.
You won't win, Senator. We both know that.
But I can't help her.
Now, I realize you two don't get along.
She despises me.
And I have to say, the feeling is mutual.
  Well, listen     The moment she became Secretary of State,
she got the Republicans to
remove me from the Foreign Relations Committee.
And Francis was very upset about that.
But that was the past.
Let's talk about the future.
This support for Claire, it's caught us both off guard.
But you are my choice for vice president.
Nothing has changed on that front.
Well, my only concern are the rumors.
They could damage my chances.
Yes. And we'll do what we can to combat those.
That's what Claire said, too, and it's much appreciated.
But, if, and   Oh, God, it's a big if.
But what if...
support for Claire picks up steam...
Well, you don't actually think that will happen?
Oh, no. I mean, a First Lady as VP?
No.
The party wants someone with experience, and so does the country.
Absolutely.
But... it is an open convention,
and so we have to operate
with the belief that anything could happen.
I mean, the press is certainly enjoying imagining it.
Well, sure. It makes for a good story.
Yeah, and it's the kind of coverage that we can't really control.
You know, I mean,
these things have a way of taking on a life of their own.
Like the Zoe Barnes story
did about my nomination for Secretary of State.
Except that one we planted.
  And this one you didn't.   No, absolutely not!
I mean, Claire was mortified by those votes.
What you're saying is if the coverage influences enough people...
Well, we have to be prepared for that.
I mean...
of course, politically, it would be a disaster.
Maybe, maybe not.
You don't think so?
Well, personally, I think Claire would do an excellent job.
Well, I am very surprised to hear you say that.
You don't believe she would?
Well, I've just never really considered it.
The First Lady? As vice president?
Well,  delegates think it's a good idea.
Well, most of those were from Texas, which was a lark.
Was it?
I have as many delegates as you do, Senator.
  But if you start pushing yours my way...   You double.
And take the lead.
  And then Cathy puts you over the top.   That's the idea.
So she's in on this?
She will be.
Well, let's say Claire does take the lead,
however unlikely that may be...
  Very unlikely, I would say.   Well, let's say she does.
What do you propose?
I honestly don't know.
Well, you'd have to support her, wouldn't you?
You... you can't abandon your own wife.
Uh, true, but I can't abandon you either.
Well, if she took the lead,
I suppose I'd have to support her, too.
No, I would never ask you to do that.
But you don't have to ask. We're on the same team here.
Well, to be perfectly blunt...
what's in it for me?
What would it take?
You're doing the selling. Make me an offer.
Let's say Claire gets it.
I assume I stay on, if you get the general.
Oh, absolutely.
I cannot imagine the next
four years without you being my Secretary of...
...State.
You'd give me Cathy's job?
We're prepared to.
  Doug.   Madam Secretary.
We have an issue, sir.
When I first warned the president that ICO would grow,
and grow quickly, he did nothing.
Yesterday, the leaders of ICO sent out this tweet.
"As Suwar is ours.
Soon heads will roll into the Euphrates."
That wasn't just in Arabic, that was in English,
and sent out in  other languages.
They're media savvy, they're recruiting around the globe.
They have the money and the manpower now.
Once they get to the Euphrates,
they'll have a choke hold on northern Syria.
We must act, Mr. President, and we must act now.
Normally, there's a tradition of sportsmanship
when it comes to conventions.
One candidate lays low
so the other gets his or her moment in the spotlight.
But not only is the president
ignoring a great threat to the world's security,
he's insulted the one man who stood up and spoke out for us all.
When this profile came out
about everything the general just mentioned,
the White House said that he was politicizing terrorism.
And when I announced that General Brockhart
was going to be my running mate,
the president's campaign said, and I quote,
"It's a shame the general traded in patriotism for careerism."
Now, I don't call that very sportsmanlike.
I call it disgraceful.
How many wars has the president fought for his country?
I think we all know, none.
And he questions the patriotism of a man who has fought in many?
You hear me, Mr. President.
I demand that you do something about ICO.
And I demand that you make an apology to the general.
And we're not leaving Atlanta until you've done both.
Live on every network right now.
I gotta hand it to him.
I wonder if this was his idea,
'cause it's almost something like I would do.
We ignore him. It's  degrees. Let him sweat it out.
I think the longer we ignore him, the more attention they'll get.
I agree with LeAnn.
So apologize.
It's only pride.
I can do it if you want, sir.
I wrote the statement.
No, it only works if it comes from Francis.
Claire's right.
And we can do more than just apologize.
I can meet with the bastard.
The issues the governor and the general raise are important ones.
They transcend party affiliations and, quite frankly, politics.
And so in that spirit, I'm inviting the governor
to come here and join me,
so that we can have a conversation privately because...
whoever becomes the president is going to have to deal with ICO
and all of the other terrorist threats that we face around the globe.
So I'm looking forward to hearing
whatever ideas and solutions that they may have...
because a smart president will steal good ideas from anyone.
Let's kill them with kindness, shall we?
  Governor.   Mr. President.
Would you please put the General on the line?
Sir?
General...
your service to this country is greatly valued
and your patriotism is without doubt.
And in the heat of the campaign, well, we went too far.
We issued statements that we shouldn't have,
and for that I want to apologize,
and I do hope that you will accept it.
Far more important to me than an apology
is eliminating ICO, Mr. President.
I couldn't agree with your more, General.
If you'd be so kind as to put the Governor back on the phone.
I received your invitation, Mr. President.
And will you join us, Governor?
Only if it leads to real action, not just talk.
I can promise you, Governor,
and the rest of America that it will not just be talk.
Then, yes. If it truly leads to securing our freedom.
Thank you very much. I look forward to seeing you.
Thank you all very much.
Right this way, Governor.
Do you think this a good idea?
What choice do I have? He called my bluff.
Welcome, Governor.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I have a room set up for us.
Here.
Have some lunch.
We've got ham, and I think some turkey.
I'm good, but thanks.
Really?
After the stunt you just pulled, I would've thought you love ham.
You put this here on purpose.
Well, a little reading material, you know.
Something to pass the time.
I just got a text from Ben Grant saying
searches for this issue is
going through the roof since we showed up here.
Ben Grant owns Pollyhop...
That's right.
And you own Ben Grant.
Isn't that what power is? The people you collect?
You really screwed me with that webcast.
I had everything all planned out.
The Federal Election Commission, the Department of Justice.
I was looking forward to watching you go down in flames...
maybe even behind bars.
Well, I'm sorry I ruined your fun.
It's a bit embarrassing, though, isn't it?
I mean, sharing all your most intimate moments?
Videos of your children?
I'm proud of my family. Why would I be embarrassed?
Well, just that you have to stoop so low to win everyone's love.
It feels a bit desperate, doesn't it?
You're  points behind in every poll.
So, if anyone's desperate, it should be you.
Well, the key to being President
is not only winning your battles,
it's winning them with dignity.
Should we talk about ICO?
Oh, God. Why would we want to do that?
It's why we're meeting.
Oh, right.
"Real talk, real action."
That's what you're all about, isn't it?
Well, I suppose we could if you want to, but...
then again we could just take a break from it all
and relax a bit.
God.
This turkey tastes like rubber.
Well, it's better than eating a real one.
Oh, I always wear protection
when I'm getting my dick sucked by the Democrats.
You okay?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Don't make me laugh when I'm eating. I nearly choked to death.
Well, that is one way for me to become president.
  Here you go.   Thank you.
  You okay?   Oh, yeah.
Do you mind if I take these off?
They're brand new and I'm still breaking 'em in.
You like to play video games, right?
Now, how did you hear about that?
Tom Yates.
Oh, yes.
Tom Yates.
That's one person you weren't able to collect, were you?
What did you do to get him back?
Oh, look, I'm sure he was tempted.
He is a fiction writer, after all.
You're a New York Republican.
That's an attractive fiction, isn't it?
And you're a Democrat from South Carolina,
that's even bigger fiction.
Well, there you go.
And I'm a New York Republican, which is basically a Democrat.
If you were a Democrat, you'd be unstoppable.
You'd be the new JFK.
And if you were a Republican, who'd you be? Nixon?
Nixon was a far more effective president.
The only reason people glorify Kennedy is because he got shot.
Well, you've got that going for you, too, now, don't you?
And you've got your search engine
and all your little home videos.
See, if people want a piece of you...
you give it to them, right?
Oh, is that what people want?
A piece of you?
Do you play video games?
No. My kids do.
There's this one game that my son Charlie, he loves to play.
It's called Agar.Io.
I have to admit, I might have played it a couple of times myself.
You start out as a little dot.
And then you go around
eating these other dots and you get bigger.
And the bigger you get,
you gotta avoid getting eaten by the bigger players.
Meanwhile, you're trying to eat the smaller players.
Sounds a little like running for president.
So, are you playing with real people right now?
Yeah. From all over the world.
Here, you try it.
  Oh, I got eaten.   Press that.
Ah, oh, I see. It makes you small again.
Yeah, you gotta start over from square one every single time.
Oh, God. I got eaten again.
I wonder what the other players would think
if they knew who they were playing against.
Oh, I'm rather enjoying the anonymity.
This is unprecedented.
The president and Governor Conway
are meeting right now at the convention hall.
Two candidates, face to face.
They've been in there for about ten minutes,
supposedly discussing the ICO situation.
Now, while the private meeting between the two candidates
continues behind closed doors,
delegates on the floor
are gearing up for the next round of voting for...
We should head down. The next ballot is starting soon.
  I'll be down in a minute.   In the second round of voting
a quarter of the delegates changed their votes,
support for First Lady Claire Underwood is picking up steam,
thanks in part to today's breaking story
about Mrs. Underwood's involvement in the Brandenburg negotiations.
A single vote from Senator Scott Sheer
expanded to support from the entire Texas delegation.
You've, uh, got a call.
Yeah, I better take that. They only call if it's important.
Yeah, this is Will.
Yes, put it through.
  Um, excuse me.   Sure.
Go ahead.
Damn! Nothing.
The fog of war.
A back room within a back room.
Whatever's being plotted in there,
I can tell you it's no good for me.
You know, it's at times like these I wish I was Nixon,
had every nook and cranny bugged.
  Mr. President?   Your colleague.
How targeted can he get?
We really shouldn't be discussing this over the phone.
Can he isolate a specific person?
Technically, yes, but  
A conversation?
There are catch mechanisms in the program to prevent that.
He can override, but it leaves a trail.
He's still figuring out how to mask it.
Our friend from New York.
I want to know what he's saying right now.
Sir, I strongly advise against that.
I also advise that we hang up.
All right, I'm hanging up.
Governor, should we head out?
Just a moment, Mr. President.
There's a great deal of anticipation in Atlanta...
Who was that?
The president. He just wanted the latest delegate count.
...and we're minutes away from the next ballot.
Here's a graphic of the last round yesterday.
Secretary Catherine Durant led the way
with   of delegates.
Doug hates it.
He hates what?
That you have direct access to the president
without going through him.
He wants you gone.
Doug told you that?
He wants me to dig something up on you.
I haven't found anything yet.
And you won't, because there isn't anything.
I know. Otherwise, I would've found it by now.
Why are you telling me this?
Because either you're gone or I am, if I don't deliver.
Unless you give me something.
...First Lady Claire Underwood,
a surprising fifth place show...
It can be small. Nothing too damaging.
Just so I have something to show him.
In my  years of covering presidential politics,
I've never seen anything like it.
Sorry about that.
That's all right.
Shall we go out? The next ballot is about to start.
You want to watch it together?
It might look better, the longer we're in here.
Like we grappled with the future of America.
Unless you'd rather be out there with the masses.
Oh, Christ. The masses.
  I feel the same way.   We will now commence
the third ballot
for the nomination of our party's vice presidential candidate.
We will start with Alabama.
Madam Secretary,
the great state of Alabama,
for Vice President of the United States,
casts  votes for Secretary Catherine Durant,
and our three remaining votes for the Mayor of Mobile,
Alabama's own Jane Winthrop.
Roll Tide!
Alaska, you're next.
Eight votes for Secretary of State Durant,
six votes for Senator Joseph Baker,
four votes for First Lady Claire Underwood.
California,
you have  votes.
Two hundred and thirty-three for Catherine Durant,
That's huge for the First Lady.
That puts her in third, and she's closing in on second.
Delaware.
Twelve for Durant,
four for Baker.
Hawaii, you're next.
Seventeen for the First Lady,
and  for Secretary of State Catherine Durant.
She's got a real shot.
Unbelievable!
Well, not so unbelievable.
Forty-four votes for Catherine Durant,
Louisiana,
you have  votes.
How do you cast them?
Madam Secretary...
Louisiana casts its  votes for President of the United States
to Secretary of State Catherine Durant.
Louisiana, I assume you mean vice president.
I mean president.
Madam Secretary, the state of Louisiana
believes this convention should be open
for all parts of the ticket, including president.
Louisiana!
Louisiana!
As the convention agreed to yesterday morning,
we are taking vice presidential nominations first,
in order for that process to take place over the full convention.
We have one candidate for president.
Any further discussion on that balloting
will be taken up after the vice presidential nomination process
is complete.
If you do not cast your votes, you will forfeit them.
Madam Secretary, we, Louisiana,
cast our  votes for vice president,
also for Catherine Durant.
Louisiana.
I work for the man. I'm on his cabinet.
Would you run against him if his nomination were in play?
My goal is to run with the president, not against him.
Look, I love my home state of Louisiana,
  but they're a live bunch...   She'd do a good job.
She's a much better Secretary of State, though.
I'm confident this will all work itself out.
I've considered keeping her on after you lose.
Have you spoken to President Underwood about their defection?
Not yet, but I'll be speaking with him shortly, I imagine.
Hey, this is part of what a...
  Your call.   ...convention is all about.
I wish I could take credit, but... but she called me.
Then again, when opportunity strikes...
Thank you very much.
Definitely not the way to win with dignity.
...Durant commenting on her home state of Louisiana.
If you win at all.
We should get back out there.
You've got a nomination to fight for.
The president and I, we had a great talk.
We, uh, even watched the vote together.
But I'm sure you'd rather hear from him on that than me.
Well, thank you, Governor.
Today has certainly been full of surprises, hasn't it?
But, then again,
Louisiana is the state that gave us Huey Long after all.,
As much as I would like to discuss this,
I have to get on with the business
that the governor and I have just discussed,
because the business of the presidency trumps running for it.
  Thank you, Governor.   Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you all very much.
I'm happy to answer...
I want Cathy in my room, now.
I already called her. She refuses to meet.
  She what?   That's what she said,
and then she hung up.
Her staff won't return my calls either.
For this to work, you have to go back to Washington.
I can't leave while you're dealing with this.
If you stay, it will look like you're taking advantage
and campaigning for it.
And the key is to make it look like you're not.
I'll speak with Cathy.
No, look, I've got that covered.
Question is, how we justify your going.
It's not Washington.
It should be Texas.
  Your mother.   It worked before.
I'll leave first thing in the morning.
Take Tom with you.
  Tom?   Oh, he already knows.
  Did you tell him?   He put it together.
He said, if you win this thing...
you have to give the speech of a lifetime, and he's right.
Whatever you say in that convention hall
will lay the groundwork for how we sell this
to the rest of the country.
And that is why we brought him back, right?
You can sleep like that? Sitting up?
I can sleep anywhere.
I'm lucky like that.
We have work to do.
All right, let's work.
This could be better.
Read it for me. Out loud.
I've been my husband's partner in marriage for  years.
No.
Slower.
Like you're going to say it at the convention.
I've been my husband's partner in marriage for  years.
Now, it's time for me to be..."
So I can see your face.
I've been my husband's partner in marriage for  years.
Now, it's time for me to be his
partner in the White House for the next four.
You're right.
We can do better.House.of.Cards.SE
"She squared off mano-a-mano with Petrov
to finalize the bailout deal.
Meanwhile, Secretary Durant twiddled her thumbs, waiting
without a seat at the bargaining table."
Pretty wild, huh?
  When was that posted?  : A.M.
You should go.
  No breakfast, even?   I have work to do.
Welcome back. It's a dramatic day.
Let's see where things stand.
And, Wolf, you can see the big change.
Catherine Durant now on our presidential nominating wall.
She has shifted from vice presidential hopeful
to potential presidential candidate.
And a Durant candidacy might be appealing to Democrats
who aren't enthusiastic about either Underwood or Dunbar.
And imagine this scenario
if we play this out through this convention.
Heather Dunbar came out of the primaries, of course, with  .
It's not enough to win the nomination,
but for him to win, President Underwood,
he still needs these superdelegates.
He won the popular vote when Dunbar withdrew,
but you're saying he doesn't have a technical majority.
so you see Frank Underwood drops down to  .
He's still in the lead, but not enough to clinch the nomination.
And you want a little bit more intrigue, like we need that?
Twenty-four states, Wolf, these  states highlighted,
they do not have so-called faithless delegate laws,
meaning in these  states, the delegates don't have to,
they are not legally bound to vote for the candidate
who won their state's primary or caucus.
They can vote for whoever they want.
They could vote for Heather Dunbar.
They could switch over and vote for Catherine Durant.
Wolf, if they want, they could vote for you.
They're not gonna vote for me.
But if Secretary Durant siphons off enough votes
or Underwood doesn't get that majority in the first ballot,
what, all bets are off?
I think about the only sure bet today is
President Underwood must be wishing
he hadn't agreed to this open convention.
Does Durant or Dunbar really have a shot at winning this thing?
Sure. You've got a president who wasn't elected to begin with.
His health is a giant question mark right now.
He's had a rocky tenure, plus you've got an open convention.
Anything could happen.
Like giving, uh, Durant a run for her money.
Uh, Slugline, by the way,
picked up the Politico story from yesterday.
It could get traction out there on the floor.
That's true, and, again, at an open convention,
Claire Underwood may suddenly be the dark horse here.
Mother.
Hello, Claire.
Why'd you move down here?
Hospice lady said I shouldn't be going up and down stairs anymore.
Besides, I like it. More light.
Who's that?
Uh, Tom, would you give us a minute, please?
Sorry.
No, no. Come here, young man.
Hi, Mrs. Hale.
My name's Tom.
It's Thomas Yates, the novelist. You've probably heard of him.
I think everything since John Cheever isn't worth readin'.
You're probably right.
Well, Claire... did you come to take stock of
everything you're gonna inherit when I die?
Well, it's convenient, isn't it,
having a dying mother when you need an excuse to skip town?
We won't disturb you.
It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Hale.
  Elizabeth.   All right. Well, then you call me Tom.
I hate "Thomas."
  Fair enough, Tom.   We have a deal.
We want a unified party, not a fractured one.
I can't play fast and loose with the rules.
This is an open convention. There are no rules.
I already gave Senator Sheer that prime-time spot that you wanted.
But this, as chair of the convention  
And I made you chair of this convention
precisely for moments like this.
I have an obligation to not play favorites.
Your obligation to the party
is an obligation to the leader of the party,
and as the president, that would be me.
  Correct?  Yes, sir, but  
Then this isn't about favoritism. It's about solidarity.
We've got a car waiting to take you
to the convention hall, Ms. Whittaker.
I call this convention to order
of the Democratic National Committee
and the convention chair, Patti Whittaker.
Good morning.
I was just informed that the president will travel to Washington
to meet with his national security team.
Given that key contenders for both slots on the ticket
aren't able to be on the floor today,
the Rules Committee has advised that
we should wait for their return
before any further votes are held.
There is a motion to postpone all votes
until the president's return.
ICO began its advance from As Suwar late last night,
and by our calculations and their current pace,
we expect them to reach the Euphrates within  hours.
Now, this could disrupt highway and river traffic,
but more importantly,
could give them the opportunity
to destroy vital dams in the region.
And as a result, I am heading to Washington right now
so that we can decide exactly how we should stop this ICO advance.
Is this sudden change of plans
a result of your meeting with Governor Conway yesterday?
Well, it wouldn't surprise me if ICO accelerated their plans,
uh, because of the governor's comments.
They certainly know how to take advantage of media attention.
But whether that's the truth or not,
this is an imminent threat which we must deal with immediately.
I'm glad the president heard me
and finally took General Brockhart's advice to heart.
Now we'll just have to
wait and see if it actually results in anything.
I just hope it's not too little, too late.
What are your plans now, Governor? Remain in Atlanta?
No, Hannah and I are heading back on the trail.
We accomplished what we needed to here in Georgia, and
we're heading off to Arizona today and then Utah.
Mr. President. Mr. President.
Why Washington and not here?
This issue is too sensitive for a mobile White House.
I need to be in the Situation Room
with my entire staff and team of advisors around me.
Mr. President. Mr. President.
Yes, Adam.
Mr. President, is this a way to silence Secretary Durant
after Louisiana put her in the running for president?
I don't use national security matters for political purposes.
You know that, Adam.
You have any other further questions, please direct them to Seth.
Thank you all very much.
  You want me to come with?   No, you stay behind.
  Keep everything under control.   Yes, sir.
There are reports that she's left Atlanta.
The First Lady left earlier this morning.
Her mother's health has deteriorated in the past few days.
Does this mean she's out of the running for VP?
The First Lady was never in the running.
She and the president continue to support Catherine Durant  
Father of four, sailor...
staph infection from stepping on a rusty fish hook.
Heavens!
And this one, yeah, you were a fruit fly.
  A fruit fly.   Yes.
You were a consort to Rasputin and his  inch...,
No, don't say it.
I don't have to say it because you're already imagining it.
I looked it over.
I'll meet you outside.
Uh, gonna leave all this to Vi and the girls
if you're not interested.
Grandmother's jewelry?
She'd turn over in her grave
if I didn't at least offer it to you.
She had great taste.
Where do you think I got it from?
What's this?
Look at it. Open it up.
Must be worth somethin', baby teeth of the First Lady.
I like that boy.
Makes me laugh.
Like your father used to.
Can't imagine daddy dressed up as a fortune teller.
Oh, you'd be surprised. He had a silly side to him.
Not that I ever saw.
Well, there were certain things that he only did with me.
Oh, you see, laughter is good for the pain.
Even better than this morphine.
  Let me help you.   No, no, I can do it.
You just go.
Go!
You crossed everything out.
  It wasn't good.   I know.
Is that what you're gonna do here, after she dies?
Cross everything out... because it wasn't good?
You're not going to get me to talk about my mother.
I hope not.
Hatred's ugly.
It's too beautiful a day for that.
Back to the salt mines.
Please, sit.
Sir, these are the current ICO positions.
We're still drafting action items,
but we can give you a rough sense  
Well, before we discuss any military options,
I'd like to put a call in to Damascus and see what they'll allow.
Madam Secretary, won't you join me?
So you had to call a national security meeting
just to get us in the same room?
And to keep you off the phone with Conway.
All I needed was one call to him. I don't need to make another.
You don't actually think
he's gonna make you Secretary of State, do you?
Probably not, but I would've paid good money
just to see your face when he told you.
I never promised you the ticket.
I promised you I'd try.
You pretended to try.
Claire's support didn't just happen on its own,
and you had the gall to take my hand,
look me in the eye and lie to my face.
  You're mistaken, Cathy.   Oh, come on, Frank.
I've had a front row seat to everything
since the day Walker took office,
all the lies and betrayals, and I helped you.
My mistake was I assumed you wouldn't stab me in the back.
Your mistake is that it backfired.
This is all personal, isn't it?
This is about how Claire treated you when I was in the hospital.
Give me more credit than that. This is business.
We were partners. You broke the contract.
  So, what do you want?   What else is there, Frank?
Nothing.
It's simple. Either Claire's votes come my way...
or I turn the convention upside down.
We need to talk about Seth.
I've been getting calls from former clients.
Now, before you say anything, here's the dirt.
I cheated on a math test in th grade,
I shoplifted a homecoming dress when I was ,
I experimented with a sorority sister in freshman year,
and I was late on my taxes in .
What he won't find is anything that justifies firing me.
I'm sure he was just vetting you. We do that with everyone.
Okay, if that's your story, then fine,
but all I care about is winning this election.
So let's get past our personal shit and be a team, okay?
We're fighting a common enemy here, Mr. President.
It's important that we remain united.
Yeah, and I can assure you that Secretary Durant will reach out
before we conduct any operation.
Thank you for your time, Mr. President.
We'll be in touch as soon as we come up with a plan.
You're acting like I'll still be Secretary of State.
Well, if you play your cards right, you will be.
Who else did you offer the VP slot to?
There's Jackie, Austen, me. Anyone else?
Austen withdrew on his own, and so did Jackie.
I did not push her out.
Jackie says you took her for granted,
that you bullied her, you intimidated her.
And that is what she is telling every member
of the California delegation, one phone call at a time.
California. Lots of votes.
California, the largest piece of delegates at the Democratic Convention.
I'm told that delegation is trending toward Heather Dunbar.
Let's watch this, Wolf.
Let's imagine she only picked up
two-thirds of the California delegates.
That gets you above  there.
Plus, we assume she'll keep her home state Connecticut's support.
Off to a pretty good start.
It's over  delegates. What, roughly, uh,   of the vote?
That alone could take this, what, to a second ballot?
That takes it to a second ballot, an open convention again.
Plus, we also assume that
Louisiana will stay with Catherine Durant.
So, we are not going to have a definitive idea
of how all this is gonna shape up
at least until they conduct the first ballot.
There's still no update as to, uh,
when the president and Secretary Durant will return.
No, and that adds to some of the uncertainty here.
So let's go back to the floor, see how things are playing out.
It didn't specify in the article
which direction the motorcade was heading.
East.
You're sure?
Thank you very much.
Hot damn!
I am promising you Secretary of State for as long as you want it
and my full support when you run for President in .
I mean, who knows, you might even get lucky.
My liver might fail before then.
Your promises stopped meaning much
after you promised Baker my job.
I have no intention of offering him Secretary of State.
Oh, so you lied to him the way Walker lied to you.
No. Walker and I didn't have a history.
And Walker didn't respect me.
You and I have a history, Cathy, and I respect you immensely.
But our history goes back three years.
Claire's and my partnership goes back .
You have to respect that.
I might have...
if you had been honest with me from the beginning.
Well, I wish I could turn back time, but here we are.
And you can keep me out of Atlanta for as long as you want,
but you can't hold the vote back forever.
Time's moving forward, not back. And time is on my side.
If Heather Dunbar wants to take advantage of the President's absence,
that's her prerogative.
But she's still in D.C., there's no public statement.
You see that as taking advantage?
You think Congresswoman Sharp would make calls on her behalf
if she wasn't pulling the strings from Washington?
Sharp says she's doing it on her own.
You don't have any proof of coordination.
You're right, I don't.
Just human nature, basic logic,
and a slightly better than average understanding
of political gamesmanship.
Uh, if you will excuse me, even press secretaries have to pee.
  I'll just be right back.   Okay.
Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
What's up?
LeAnn knows, and I think you told her.
I did. Straight up. I told her everything.
  Let's go. Upstairs.   No.
  Excuse me?   You've got Dunbar in play,
you got Durant with the President,
and the First Lady's in Dallas.
And I've got a room full of press
that I've been keeping at bay since : this morning,
so I will tell you why I told her...
after I tuck in all the children.
Let's vote now!
Order, please!
It is Senator Sheer's time to speak.
Order!
Maybe we should let Cathy have her way.
If the vote's held now, you two win. We focus on the general.
What's brought all this on?
I just wonder if we're in over our heads,
Francis, trying to do this.
Is it your mother?
I'm sure it's difficult to see her this sick.
She's completely helpless.
But we're not helpless. We can turn this around.
I guess I'm just...
I don't know, maybe... maybe we're making a mistake.
Maybe I'm not ready to be your running mate.
  Conway has a four-star general.   Is she happy, your mother?
No, she's miserable.
Tom makes her laugh, but mostly, no.
Imagine my liver's failing.
  Imagine I'm dying.   Francis...
No, I just want you to picture it for just a moment.
There I am, lying in a bed just like your mother is now.
The only thing that would make me happy
is to know that you would take over after I passed.
If it were Cathy...
I'd be just as miserable as your mother is.
I'll do my part.
You just concentrate on that speech.
All right. Thank you, Francis.
Good night.
  She, uh... she won't eat?   It's hard for her to swallow.
How much time do you think she has?
I can't be definitive, but... a couple of weeks, maybe.
If she stops eating altogether, it could be days.
She's in a lot of pain.
She doesn't have to be.
When it gets to this point, we can make her comfortable.
Comfortable enough that the body will let go.
Does she want that?
That is something you should discuss with your mother.
I like the plants.
The plants you put in there.
It's the little things, right?
If we take out the refineries,
that would eliminate their revenue stream.
They can't advance if they don't have the resources.
President Makhzun made it very clear
he wants those to remain intact.
It's our best option from a strategic point of view.
Minimal loss of life, maximal impact on capability.
It's either total war or nothing at all.
Well, that doesn't sound very diplomatic, Cathy.
We're going to be diplomatic with terrorists?
I made a promise to President Makhzun.
You've broken promises before. Why should this be any different?
Why don't we break for dinner? We'll pick this up afterwards.
I wanna review this a bit more.
I'll have some food brought into the Roosevelt Room.
Thank you all very much.
Cathy, why don't you and I eat in here?
"Total war or nothing at all"?
The moment I get in front of those cameras
and I tell them that Conway is right and Brockhart is right,
and that you completely bungled the ICO situation,
how do you think Dunbar will do then?
Can we get two Cobb salads in here, please?
  I don't like Cobb salad.   Then you don't have to eat it.
Thanks for coming over.
Way easier coming here than you coming there.
Must be ten news crews outside of my house.
How'd you escape?
The old-fashioned way. Back door.
How did you get my home phone?
Oh, old-fashioned way.
Rolodex from the Herald.
  Come with me. I won't keep you long.   Yeah.
  How long did this take you?   Couple of months.
I've been working on my own.
We had a whole team and we didn't find this.
Well, you probably weren't digging as deep as the Bates City Vine.
No.
We spent most of our energy tracking the money.
We should've been more focused on the travel logs.
I wouldn't have checked either until I spoke with a pizza guy.
Then I realized they might be manipulating the logs.
Which gets you to Lanagin.
It still doesn't prove he met with Lanagin,
but I don't know where else that motorcade would've been heading.
Are you going public with this?
I could, but he has some plausible deniability.
He pins it all on Meechum.
If he's covering up travel,
who knows what else he's covering up?
That's the story I want,
not some Secret Service man being loose with the books.
So you're still under the radar.
I have to ask you to keep all this to yourself.
I know it can be tempting now that... you have a chance,
but if this goes public too early, his guard goes up.
Listen, it was hard when I withdrew.
How the leadership abandoned me, how the public did.
It took some time...
but I made my peace.
It's a crapshoot whether I can win this.
He can probably fight that off.
You need to write the story that he can't fight off.
You investigated him. Where's the weak link?
Remy Danton.
Tom did that.
It's a shame. He'd be good for you.
I never believed in the tooth fairy.
Well, you took the money anyway.
Could you turn off that light, please? Hurts my eyes.
When you were small... you used to...
used to ask me to make it stop, the dark.
Do you remember?
Yes.
And I promised you I would... in the morning.
But, damn it, you would sit at that window...
every night...
trying to make the sun rise, all by yourself.
Your daddy would put you in bed...
after you'd fallen asleep with your face against the glass.
And I was so jealous.
Of me and Daddy?
That you believed.
You believed you could make the sun rise.
I spoke to her, Mother, the nurse.
I can't do it.
I can't do it, Mother.
I can't do what you want me to do.
Claire...
it'd help you win...
having your mother gone.
Do this for me.
And let me be a help to you.
Finally.
Tom.
She wants you to be there.
What do you want?
I want you to be there, too.
Okay.
I told her because you put me in an impossible situation.
There's nothing on her, but you wouldn't listen.
And you must not have listened when you came over to my house.
I was very clear.
So... you're gonna throw me on the ground again?
Look, here's a glass. Let's go ahead.
You wanna fire me?
Fine. It's another resignation.
After Remy, after Brockhart.
With Durant, with Dunbar.
You know, I spin stories for a living.
I can't begin to tell you how to spin this.
You know, the minibar wasn't open because you wanted a Diet Coke.
I'm worried about you, Doug.
Nobody needs to worry about me.
Yeah, somebody does...
because this scorched-earth policy is bad for us.
I don't give a rat's ass about LeAnn Harvey. We need her.
And you need me. And we both need you.
  At your best.   I'm fine.
Are you? Instead of having me do damage control,
you're having me do damage to one of our own.
I am trying to protect the president.
And I'm trying to protect you...
from yourself.
You're so full of shit. You don't care about me.
After what you did, I should hate you.
But where does it get us?
Check out the Telegraph.
The strategy is working...
if you let it.
Or make me resign. Your call.
  Are you okay?   It's what she wanted.
I was asking you.
Schedule the vote for tomorrow.
I'll fly back to speak just before.
Claire, your mother just passed.
Schedule it, Francis.
Tom wrote a speech. It's good.
  Cathy's not on board yet.   Then get her on board.
I'm sorry.
  I didn't mean to     No, no, it's all right.
I'll get it done.
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.
Ask Secretary Durant to meet me in the Oval.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President.
Coffee table.
The funny thing is I didn't even have to ask him to do it.
He did it on his own.
I especially like where he says,
"Catherine Durant is functional.
Claire Underwood is formidable."
So, you see, you don't even have time on your side. It's on ours.
By tomorrow morning, there'll be a dozen articles just like that.
So you have a choice.
You can redeem yourself as Secretary of State
over the next four years,
or go down in history as a fluke, who bungled the Middle East
and couldn't even close the deal in Brandenburg.
You have your version. I have mine.
I'm sure mine will get just as much traction as this.
But my version wins because it's the better story...
and it's also exactly how things went down.
You see, you don't even have the truth going for you.
I'm not scared of you.
My endorsement of Dunbar, that makes for an even better story.
But you wanna know what the best story is?
Claire's mother just died.
  I'm sorry to hear that.   Oh, I don't think you really are,
but that doesn't matter because the rest of the world will.
And by the time she gives her speech tomorrow night,
there won't be a dry eye in Atlanta
or across the rest of the country.
So, you get to keep your job, Cathy,
in return for your delegates.
That offer is still on the table.
I have been loyal. I got you that table.
Do you wanna keep it, or do you wanna give it to Conway?
You know, when I was waiting for my transplant,
I had the most vivid hallucinations. You wouldn't believe 'em.
Do you know who I saw?
Peter Russo and Zoe Barnes, right here in this room.
Zoe was trying to seduce me, right here on this couch,
and Peter, he shoved my face up against this glass.
Cigarettes and razor blades and sex.
It was terrifying.
All I wanted to do was get out of this room
that I worked so hard to get in.
But of course, it makes sense that they would've haunted me
because it's all true.
  What is?   Everything Lucas Goodwin claimed.
I killed them both, just like he said I did.
But of course, nobody believes it, and nobody ever will.
Because that's how good we are...
at making things...
disappear.
No, we didn't kill anybody.
But we would have...
if it was necessary.
So, you're right, the time for negotiations is over.
You will hand over your delegates,
and you will serve on in my cabinet.
And we will forget that any of this ever happened.
Because if you don't...
I swear to God...
I will never...
ever forget.
Do you understand now?
Yes.
Good.
Now, let's go decide what we're gonna do about these terrorists.
Want me to call someone? Make arrangements?
We made the sun rise.
She told you that, too?
We should get going.
Me and Hannah want to extend our warmest condolences
to the First Lady and the President.
They and all of Elizabeth Hale's loved ones are in our prayers.
And we won't be campaigning today out of respect for their loss.
God bless President and Mrs. Underwood.
Got it.
Put it out.
Perfect timing... for her to drop dead.
We were on a roll, too.
I should prep for the speech.
I have a room set up for you. I'll be right in.
Right this way, Mrs. Underwood.
I read the draft.
And?
  I wouldn't change a thing.   I'm glad you're pleased.
I'm glad you were with her.
She's strong. You're a lucky man.
Don't I know it.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor to introduce
Secretary of State Catherine Durant.
Thank you, thank you very much.
I know that all of you join me in offering
our sincere condolences to the First Lady for her loss.
Tonight, I want to offer my sincere gratitude
to all the delegates who have honored me with their support
during the course of this convention.
Thank you so much.
However, after much deliberation...
I have decided that I have more to offer you as Secretary of State
than to resign and run for office.
But I want to encourage every one of you who has supported me
to join me in supporting this extraordinary woman,
the First Lady of the United States, Claire Hale Underwood.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And good evening.
As all of you know, my mother,
Elizabeth Constance Hale,
passed away last night after a long illness.
She was a strong woman...
a fierce Texan...
We had... a difficult relationship from childhood onwards.
At times, there were long periods of estrangement.
We hurt each other... often and deeply.
If there was one good thing that came from my mother's illness...
it gave us a chance to reconnect, to mend old wounds.
And that's not an opportunity
people always get before a parent dies,
and I'm grateful to have had that.
And what am I doing here?
I'm here because my mother wanted me to be.
Yesterday, before she passed, she said to me,
"Claire... do this.
If the people want it, listen to them.
And if you lose, then you lose.
But if you win...
be honored, be humbled,
and win this election with Francis!"
And I told her, I said, "The Conways are tough opponents."
And she said, "They may be tough, but they're not Texas tough."
Loss is a sobering phenomenon.
Several months ago, I almost lost my husband.
Our nation almost lost a President.
Loss makes us reevaluate what we hold dear.
And I'll tell you, there were...
times in the not too distant past,
where Francis and I, we... almost lost our marriage.
Hard times when we thought we wouldn't make it.
And like many of you know,
marriage isn't always the smoothest road.
And it took the actions of a deranged young man
to remind me how important Francis is to me.
And now, with my mother gone...
he's the only family I have left.
I trust Francis Underwood with my life,
with our nation, with our future.
I hope you will, too.
And if you trust the both of us, I'll heed my mother's words,
and I'll be honored if you nominate me as his running mate.
Claire! Claire! Claire!
Jesus! You did great work.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Madam Secretary, as Convention Chair,
I move that we make the nomination
of Claire Underwood for Vice President...
and Francis Underwood for President by acclamation.
Do I hear a second to vote by acclamation
for the nomination of the President and the Vice President?
  Hear, hear!   So moved.
All of those in favor of the nomination
of Francis Underwood for
President of the United States, say "Aye."
  Aye!   All those against.
Nay!
All those in favor of the nomination of Claire Underwood
for our Vice President of the United States, say "Aye."
Aye!
  Against?   Nay!
The Ayes have it!
Our party's ticket for the  Presidential Election
will be Francis and Claire Underwood!House.of.Cards.SE
President and Mrs. Underwood are back in Louisiana today,

...questions from undecided voters

The First Lady took questions
at a town hall meeting in Casper today.
That's  cities in half as many days for the Underwoods.
Meanwhile, they still trail Conway
by  to  points in every national poll.
That's a big gap to close...
supporters in Boise waited an extra two hours for the president...
The president's whistle-stop tour of Ohio will...
You're one of the states that will decide this!
...took questions from undecided voters
in Charleston this afternoon, the first of three events...
Please give a big Boston welcome to the next president...
For many Americans, the question remains,
what would an Underwood-Underwood White House look like?
Both Underwoods have courted  
So, Arizona, Nevada, and California on Monday,
then the upper Midwest on Tuesday.
It's not enough. Conway's hitting way more states than we are.
Well, he's not a sitting president. He has more time than you do.
Well, then we have to make more time.
We have to get out there. We've got to shake  
Francis, are you okay?
  I'm fine.   Sit down for a moment.
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's continue.
If you wanna add a fundraiser in California,
we can make that happen.
Okay.
So?
I agree with Dr. Saxon and the medical team.
We should reduce air travel to once a week.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
You wanted a second opinion, sir. You have it.
I didn't want a second opinion. I wanted a different opinion.
Planes take a toll.
We're concerned about a sudden organ rejection.
I can't win an election if I can't travel.
You can't win if you're hospitalized.
Thank you, Doctor.
You stay here. I'll go wherever Conway goes, I'll just  
I'm on the top of the ticket. It has to be me.
We can't ignore the doctors, Francis.
It's the story we tell.
If I stay here, Conway prances around the country,
playing up his fighter-pilot image, and meanwhile,
  I'm stuck here in the Rose Garden     I won't risk losing you.
Let's be smart about this.
  I need to project strength.   So project it.
The air strikes are working, sir.
We've stopped ICO's advance to the Euphrates.
We've delayed the advance. We haven't stopped it.
Your own reports say they're regrouping.
I want a decisive blow,
a face, the leadership, to send a message.
Uh, the Ahmadi brothers are in hiding.
We don't know their location.
Well, your task is to find them.
We've tried, sir.
Our assets hit a wall.
To root them out would require special forces on the ground.
That is a step I am willing to take.
We don't have authorization from the Syrians.
Secretary Durant will smooth that out.
I will not be satisfied
by blocking the serpent's path, gentlemen.
I wanna cut off its goddamn head.
The Syrians will say no, and when they do,
see if they'll work with the Russian special forces.
The Russians do the dirty work, we take all the credit.
Petrov won't go for that.
Well, he will if we give him back some of our drilling zones.
Well, that'll take congressional approval.
Doug's laying the groundwork now.
Are you interested in my opinion on this,
or has it already been decided?
I want to move fast,
so unless you have a quicker option,
it's probably best you keep it to yourself.
  Yes, sir.   Cathy.
Do we have a problem?
No, sir. I'll coordinate with Doug.
After a dog's bitten you, you either put it to sleep,
or you put a muzzle on it.
I've chosen a muzzle... for now.
I was, uh, thinking on the way over here
that I don't wanna do the same speech at every event.
I really think we'll get more news coverage
if I have a different speech every time.
LeAnn already told me.
I've been working on some variations.
I think, uh, we also need to
respond to what Conway is saying...at all times.
Start putting pressure on him.
Seth's office is sending me transcripts.
There was an interview query from Time,
a voicemail about some memorial fund.
Senator Halston called about the meeting on Tuesday.
Wait. The voicemail.
Uh, Laura Moretti,
from the Anthony Moretti Memorial Fund.
  I guess you... donated?   Cue that up for me.
Just press one when you're ready.
  I'll catch up with you in a little bit.   Okay.
Hi, this is Laura Moretti
leaving a message for Douglas Stamper.
I just, uh... I wanted to reach out to you personally,
to say thank you for the incredibly generous donation.
It's the biggest donation we've received.
By a lot.
Uh, I don't know how you found out about us.
Maybe because of the President's transplant.
But whatever the reason,
it means so much to us, to me and my children.
Anyway, I... and I know this is a long shot,
but if you're ever free for coffee,
I'd love to thank you in person.
No worries if... if you can't.
Um, thanks again, Mr. Stamper.
Hi, uh, this is Laura Moretti
leaving a message for Douglas Stamper.
I just, uh... I wanted to reach out to you personally,
to say thank you for the incredibly generous donation.
It's the biggest donation we've received.
Will there be enough time to get this up on the teleprompter?
They're mostly cuts.
Should be quick. I'll get it there now.
What did you change?
I took out the paragraph about love.
  That's the best part.   It was too soft.
This used to be a barbecue joint, here.
Frank came a lot before he was president.
What happened to it?
Same thing that happens to everything Frank touches.
  You mind?   I do mind.
I haven't agreed to anything yet.
Tell me what you know.
I know Underwood lied about the money laundering.
I know he met with Lanagin when he said he didn't.
I know Edward Meechum doctored travel records,
and I know you were there for all of it.
Then Tusk gets a pardon. You get Chief of Staff.
  Old news.   Why'd you quit the job?
I wanted to go back in the private sector.
You just said everything Underwood touches gets demolished.
I don't like the man. So what?
Why'd you team up with him again for the Russia deal?
I don't have to like the people I work with.
Plus, there was a fortune to be made.
See...
I don't think you give a damn about the money.
There's a lot more to this you're not admitting.
But I think you want to.
So, truth is, you don't have anything solid.
I will get to the bottom of this story.
We can talk now, or you can wait till you have a team of lawyers
talking to my fact checkers.
I've been threatened by billionaires and by presidents.
You think an out-of-work reporter makes me nervous?
I can call the White House right now,
let 'em know you're working on this story.
That's a gamble I took asking to meet.
But my chips...
are on the better part of you prevailing.
The who... the what... the why, how...
Don't ignore where.
I think it'd be better if I turn it.
I think... I think this side is a little better.
  Yes, that's very nice.   Freddy.
  Good afternoon, Mr. President.   Good afternoon.
Helen is teaching me the ropes.
We'll leave you be, sir.
Oh, Freddy?
Why don't you stay back for a little bit? Thank you very much.
I'll be right there.
It's been a while.
Well, they, uh... moved me to the flower shop a few months ago.
The basement.
That's probably why you haven't seen me around.
Never would've guessed that, well, that this would be my thing.
I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks.
  How's your grandson?   He's good, good.
Just started school again.
  What grade is he in now?   Sixth grade.
Getting up there.
I... I really should go.
We got a big, uh, shipment of autumn blooms in.
Well, then another time, I guess, maybe.
You know, Frank...
I'm gonna be leaving soon.
Helen's husband opened up a flower shop in Georgetown.
They want me to work there.
Well, are you not happy here, Freddy?
Time to try something new.
Well, is there anything I can do to convince you to stay?
A raise? Better hours?
I appreciate it, but I've already told Helen yes, and...
I plan on keeping my word on that. It's what I want.
Well, I'm gonna miss you around, Freddy.
There's not many people here...
Well, I guess there aren't that many people here
I'm all that comfortable with.
You know what you should do before you go?
You should come up here one night and cook us a rack of ribs.
Now, I realize oven-baked isn't nearly as good as the smoker,
but you'd make 'em delicious, anyhow.
Ribs? Really?
You want me to cook ribs for you.
Well, sure, just like old times. What's wrong with that?
I'm just the help, ain't I?
  No, that's not true.   I tell you I got something good going,
and your first thought ain't,
"Freddy, congratulations."
It's "Make me ribs." And what's my big send-off?
  I get to cook you ribs.   No.
Look, you are being way oversensitive about this.
You're misinterpreting what I meant.
You're right.
It's all my fault.
  I don't know how Claire does it.   What did you just say?
Is this how you treat her? She part of the collection, too?
I don't know where all this is coming from,
but it's extremely ungrateful,
given all that I have done for you.
What did you do for me, Frank?
This is the White House.
You will call me "Mr. President"!
You're a motherfucker!
Get out!
My bad, my bad.
You're a motherfucker, Mr. President!
Governor Conway continues to say
we're not doing enough about terrorism,
but he ignores the fact that ICO has been stopped in its tracks.
The president is working tirelessly to combat our enemies abroad,
and what Governor Conway lacks in his assessment...
is the decades of experience the president brings...
Do you think you should keep calling him "The president"?
Well, I wanna emphasize that we're running mates,
and LeAnn is telling me that the marriage angle isn't working.
Screw the research.
People want to hear the real you, a real person.
That's what you gave them at the convention.
Sorry.
That was very different.
Exactly. It was very different. It was honest.
And you don't want to just react to what he's saying.
You wanna offer something.
I have been campaigning with Francis for  years.
You don't ever let the opponent walk all over you.
If you're getting attacked, you fight back.
Fine, but fight back in a different way.
This guy is... He's all spotlight and surface,
and magazine covers and Twitter. Don't play his game.
Don't play the game at all, please. Get beyond the game.
You know what? Let's finish this in the morning, please.
I'm sorry. You're right.
You have a lot more experience in this kind of thing than I do.
  I should follow your lead.   No, I... I respect your feedback.
Thank you for being so professional about everything.
  You've been very kind.   I'm not kind.
Just realistic.
That paragraph you wrote about love, it made me uncomfortable.
  Saying you love Francis?   I do love him.
Then what made you uncomfortable?
Saying it in front of you.
  Yes?   Yeah.
  How'd she do?   Very little effect.
  She was all over the news.   White noise.
So how do we make it stick?
Well, there's not much I can do.
We gave you access. I need more than I'm getting.
You're supposed to tell me what people want.
People didn't know they wanted jazz
until they heard it for the first time.
I can get them to like the music. I can't compose it.
Give me something I can work with.
Is this something we could take public?
No, it's classified.
But it's perfect, the president colluding with the Russians.
The idea has merit.
The Russians will have far more access,
and it doesn't put American troops in harm's way.
We don't get votes by praising the president's policy.
Let's have Dreyer block it in committee.
I don't like the way the president's handled ICO from the get-go,
but his approach might work here.
That's what I'm trying to prevent.
So, you wanna keep the ICO leadership alive,
so we can stay on message?
Just until November,
and then we'll hit 'em hard after inauguration.
This is the exact sort of BS I resigned over in the first place.
I'll see you over there.
Two months away from winning this thing.
But if he gains the initiative, if he picks up any momentum,
that could put us in the margin of error.
I thought you were different.
Don't get any ideas, General.
You threw caution into the wind
when you got yourself on my ticket.
You do it again, you start to look foolish.
You talk to Dreyer and  this bill.
I couldn't come to Wisconsin without having a taste test.
Mr. Hayes. My name's Tom Hammerschmidt.
I'm a freelance reporter.
I was hoping I could talk to you for a moment.
I don't talk to reporters.
It's a story about the president.
Did you not hear me the first time?
I think things happened... in your barbecue place.
Meetings.
Things you might have overheard.
I think the president broke the law,
and I think you know about it.
Come with me. Let's talk where no one can hear us.
  So, uh, you bring a recorder?   Yeah.
All right. Here's the truth.
I don't work for him no more. I don't serve him ribs no more.
I don't want nothing to do with him no more.
Even if I hated him, and I do hate him...
I don't snitch. Not to cops, not to reporters.
Not to anybody.
Leave me the fuck alone.
Okay.
Lincoln and Roosevelt were progressive Republicans.
  Jefferson was a visionary Conservative.   Yeah!
George Washington was a strong commander in chief.
William Conway embodies all these qualities.
I proudly endorse his candidacy for president,
and I ask everyone in our great state to do the same.
The next President of the United States, William Conway!
I'm... I'm humbled by your endorsement,
and by the legacy of these great men behind me.
Now, they all left very big shoes to fill.
You know who hasn't come even close to filling them?
Frank Underwood.
I should go.
Once we land.
I'll get a flight back to the East Coast.
  Tom...   You don't have to say anything.
We've had eggs thrown at the house.
Tomatoes, cow dung. You name it.
South Dakota's big Conway country.
We've been here all our lives. We raised our son here.
It's just beyond our experience.
All these folks are our neighbors.
But once I put that sign up...
Governor Conway is a veteran. He has children.
Why us and not him?
When we saw you two at the convention...
I don't know. It just seemed like a real partnership.
Love. Deep, unwavering love.
I wanna thank you for reminding me
how important that kind of love is.
Because it is. It's easy to get caught up in the campaign
and to forget how Francis and I got here in the first place,
to remember that we're not just President and First Lady,
or husband and wife.
We're partners.
We have made a choice to tackle everything together.
We go beyond what's pretty and perfect,
beyond what's scary, difficult and unknown.
We're not just partners on the ticket.
We're partners in life.
Mr. President.
You have someone on the inside of
the House Intelligence Committee
feeding you classified information.
I'm a sitting governor.
There's nothing wrong with staying informed.
Every Republican is against the Russians being involved.
You are interfering with national security.
I haven't influenced a single member.
Oh, that's because you're having Brockhart do it.
If the general chooses to share his expertise with them,
they're well served by it.
Fifty times a day, you say we should destroy ICO,
and now you're deliberately preventing us from doing it.
You could've destroyed them six months ago,
so don't lay that at my...
I don't blame you for being a fraud, Governor.
I mean, we all have to be hypocrites, every now and then.
But if you block this, I'll send American troops in instead.
You won't send Americans. Syria won't allow it.
I don't care what Syria will allow.
But wouldn't you rather have it be Russians in harm's way,
than your fellow American soldiers?
If anyone gets killed, that's going to be blood on your hands.
You want me to tell the Republicans to... get on board.
Or have the general do it.
Put politics aside and do the right thing.
Did you really think you'd be able to convince me
by making this call, Mr. President?
I'm ahead by double digits. I got a message that's working.
You're on your heels, and you're asking me to help you
by appealing to my sense of duty?
I've even got you sold on my message.
Well, you shouldn't believe everything you see on TV.
The governor has ended the call, Mr. President.
Let's go.
We're gonna go forward with our own ground operation.
I'll inform the Joint Chiefs. Sir, there's another thing.
The Intelligence Committee...
If Conway has someone on the inside  
You're worried about oversight on surveillance.
There's increased attention.
They dig around, find out what Macallan's up to...
Yeah, but I thought we were airtight.
Leann says we are, but still...
The safest thing would be to end it.
Claire Underwood's been on the move the past two days,
showing up in every state Governor Conway's held events.
Absent from the trail has been the President.
Press Secretary Seth Grayson said, quote,
"The President is attending to the business of government
for the time being," end quote.
But he neglected to say
when the President would resume campaigning,
and there are no upcoming events
currently listed on the campaign website,
leading some to speculate that the real reason for his absence
may be health-related.
It's been six months since the President received a liver transplant.
Although he was able to resume normal...
  What happened to your eye?   Freddy Hayes.
So I assume he didn't talk.
I need a way in here, Mr.Danton.
I've helped you as much as I can.
I know you won't go on record.
I'm not even asking to put you on background.
All I'm looking for is whether I'm warm or cold.
What kind of beer is that?
A lager. Some microbrew they had, um... I don't know the name.
Mind if I try it?
Go ahead.
It's good.
Used to play a drinking game when I was a teenager...
called Never Have I Ever.
  You know that game?   You drink when you have.
That's the one.
Or if the President has.
Never have I ever perjured myself
when investigated by a special prosecutor.
Never have I ever struck a deal with Raymond Tusk...
to perjure himself in exchange for a pardon.
Never have I ever conspired to impeach a President
so I could become President myself.
We're gonna need more beer.
  The First Lady is on line one, sir.   Thank you.
Claire.
Doug called me about sending in our own troops.
Well, it was that, or sit on our hands. Conway wouldn't budge.
And what does Cathy say?
I'm more interested in hearing what you think.
Well, I think... doing something is better than doing nothing.
How are the events going?
It's hard to tell. I've done so many, it's all a blur.
There's only one interview left tonight,
and then we're done for the day,
but then there's, uh... seven events tomorrow.
How are you holding up?
I called to tell you Tom's not working on the campaign anymore.
  Did he quit?   No.
What happened?
We both decided it was for the best.
We don't have to worry about him, Francis.
You sound tired.
Make sure you get a full night's sleep tonight.
  Francis?   Yes?
Nothing.
  I'll see you tomorrow.   Okay, tomorrow.
  You're certain Underwood knew?   And Walker didn't.
Could Danton have some agenda on this?
He has no reason to lie.
Who's corroborated, besides him?
No one. That's why I'm here.
I need institutional support. Legal, research...
a place to work where my dog won't bark at me.
If you crack this story, you can do anything you want.
  I'll even make you managing editor again.   I don't want that.
What I do want... is absolute autonomy.
I build my team, I keep it small,
and I answer only to you.
  How about security?   Oh, this was just some bad luck.
I've lost two reporters, Tom.
Oh, come on, Margaret.
Underwood may be a crook, but he's not a killer.
I don't think so either, but I don't wanna take any chances.
You just get me the staff I need.
Once this article comes out, I'm untouchable.
When the White House starts throwing punches... lawyer up.
'Cause he's gonna throw 'em at the Herald, not me.
Hobby I used to have.
The Battle of the Wilderness.,
I spent months building a model of it.
Started another one, but never finished it.
  Why not?   I became president.
Never enough time.
Does Claire know you asked me here?
No.
It was more than just a fling, wasn't it?
  How did she describe it?   I didn't ask.
Well, I'm not gonna go into details.
I respect you too much for that.
When you two came back from Texas...
I had a feeling.
She says... you made her mother laugh.
Yeah, I guess she took a liking to me.
Christ, I haven't seen that woman laugh in  years.
I'm just not a threat.
Just someone who didn't judge, accepted her.
Do you make Claire laugh?
We have a connection.
Yeah... I make her laugh.
I make her feel desired.
I think she feels comfortable being vulnerable around me.
I have to say, I'm a bit surprised you're not upset.
  What would that achieve?   I admire that, Frank.
I got angry with an old friend yesterday
for calling me "Frank" Instead of "Mr. President."
Just for using your name?
It wasn't the name, I suppose.
It's the fact that he's leaving me.
  Leaving you how?   New job.
  He worked for you?   Here in the White House.
It's tough for employees to be your friends.
That's why I decided to end it.
  You decided to leave.   So that she wouldn't have to ask me to.
And what about your book?
I would never betray her like that.
Thank you, Tom.
  I'll walk you out.   I know my way out.
But thanks.
Take care, Frank.
Three teams. North, east, and west.
We'll triangulate and advance on the center.
Each team will have a field agent
working with local assets to locate the Ahmadis.
Here's the executive order, sir.
Do you have a preference? Dead or alive?
Alive, if we can get intelligence out of 'em.
  Thank you, sir.   Thank you, sir.
You're officially briefing me
on ICO-related surveillance activities.
You never saw or spoke to the President.
This way.
Mr. Macallan.
  Mr. President.   The President's in his residence...
not here.
Security. We have concerns.
Conway has people on House Intelligence.
I've got everything masked.
The algorithms for ICO and the campaign are identical.
It's just a matter of what variables you input.
Give me English.
One spoon. I can use it to stir my coffee...
to eat soup...
to boil heroin.
All they see is the spoon, not what I do with it.
Or we could just get rid of the spoon.
Shut it down? Well, that would be a shame,
especially after yesterday.
  What happened yesterday?   Beyond happened.
"Beyond"?
What your wife said in South Dakota.
"Beyond what's pretty and perfect."
Liberation from convention, from the past.
Beyond surface, beyond bullshit, beyond the election.
  Beyond marriage.   Yes, exactly.
You're not just husband and wife. You're not just running mates.
You're both and more.
You're what's possible.
The Conways are everything everyone wants to be.
You're everything everyone wants to become.
The President has been shot. He's had a liver transplant.
And I'm sure everyone here in Pittsburgh is wondering,
what happens if he dies?
Not to be indelicate, but...
What if I became president?
And that's fair.
Our party chose me because they saw
one half of an indivisible team.
Unconditional support.
Two people working together for years.
Supporting each other is one thing.
Experience is another.
You have very little.
I can see from your ring that you're married.
Yes. Eighteen years.
So you know what real partnership is.
We have  years under our belts.
Learning from and advising each other? I'd call that experience.
Okay, so you've got a strong marriage,
but in terms of your qualifications  
What... what I'm saying is
that we need to get beyond husband and wife.
We need to look at the team.
Francis has served in Congress, in the White House.
I've run a major nonprofit. I served as ambassador.
We have passed legislation, developed policy.
We've done all of that together, every step of the way.
So it's natural that we would run together.
And I know Francis better than anyone.
So, if he died, to answer your question,
who better to carry out his plan for America?
Manipulation.
Deception.
Corruption.
That translates to abuse of power and breaking the law.
We know it's true, but we need corroboration.
People on record, every fact researched
and checked and double-checked.
Nothing we discuss leaves this room.
Not your friends, not your family,
not the  reporters outside that door
who wanna know what we're doing in here.
The second the White House gets wind of what we're doing...
they start to make this story...
disappear.
The radio interview you did was spectacular.
It felt good.
I feel like we're finally tapping into something.
Was it Tom, what you said in South Dakota,
with the couple?
I saw a videotape of it.
The core of it, yes. And then...
I sort of made it my own.
He should stay on.
  No.   Not as your speechwriter.
Well, I mean, yes, to the rest of the world,
he can be our speechwriter.
But that's not why he should stay on.
He should stay on because...
he can give you things that I can't.
Look, Claire, we've been a great team.
But one person...
one person cannot give everything to another person.
I can't travel with you.
I don't keep you warm at night.
I don't see you the way he sees you.
It   Look, it's not my permission to give, but...
you'll do what's right for you.
But I want you to know, if you want it...
I know you'll be careful...
and I'll be fine.
I mean, if we're gonna go beyond marriage, let's go beyond it.
You have three saved messages.
Message one. September th  
Hi, uh, this is Laura Moretti leaving a message for Douglas  
To save this message, press eight.
To call back, press five.
To    
I'm sorry. Uh, my sitter was late, and, um...
  and then there was traffic, so     Just relax.
It's fine.
It's so nice to meet you in person.
Here.
I don't know why I got them. I guess I, uh...
  Anyway.   No, they're lovely. Thank you.
And, uh... and thank you again... for that donation.
I just... I can't tell you how much it means  
You already thanked me on your voice message
and when we talked on the phone.
You don't need to thank me anymore.
Okay, no more thanks.
I hope this place is okay.
It's nothing fancy, but I come here a lot.
I like it. It has a lot of character.
Tony liked greasy spoons like this.
He used to take the kids to,
Ben's Chili Bowl every Sunday afternoon
and get them hot dogs.
Sorry.
Don't be.
I probably just shouldn't talk about my husband.
I still get emotional.
You can... if you want to.
Even if I cry?
I wanna know more about him.
Will you close the doors, please?
Where is he?
Twice in two days I've been here.
I know.
So, why am I here now?
I want you back.
I want you back, too.
But...
He understands.House.of.Cards.SE
Otherwise, it was just socialism,
which is built to fail.
And you don't get points for failure, Mr. President.
People don't want failure. They want success.
Let's discuss our recent success then.
You have been very critical of the president
for not being strong on terror.
Just last week, U.S. Special forces captured Yusuf Al Ahmadi,
and they have him in custody.
So would you now say that
your criticism of the president was unfounded?
The capture of Ahmadi is a step forward,
but the real issue here is sustained security.
The president sent in American troops
without consulting the Syrians.
Now, that's gonna do real damage to our ability
to work with them in the future.
See, this isn't about notches in a belt.
It's about a safer world for our nation.
A better future for our children.
Governor, I understand that words like "safer"
and "children" play well.
But national security is a complex and ever-changing landscape
that sometimes requires restraint,
sometimes decisive action.
So I think maybe we want to
put aside what sounds good in the moment
and be adaptable with our policy in terms of reality.
Oh, I don't need a lecture on reality
like I'm a schoolboy, Mrs. Underwood.
I've actually fought in the Middle East.
So has the general.
Our views on international diplomacy aren't just pretty words.
We can debate policy all you'd like, Governor,
but there is one thing that is undebatable.
And that is ICO is no longer the threat it once was
without their leadership.
You're not watching the debate?
I know what they're going to say.
How can I help you, Doug?
I told you there'd be a day.
There's no reason you shouldn't keep this and retire with honor.
How are we looking?
Yeah, high impact on "Ever-changing."
And Conway took the bait
and played right into "schoolboy" and "pretty",
which gives you "pretty boy." It was beautiful.
What about the marriage stuff?
Well, the more they can keep saying
"together" and "beyond" and "become"
in any context, we score on those.
I don't discuss the private conversations
we have on the Intelligence Committee.
Whistle-blowing insulates you.
And kneecap my party's nominee?
I don't think so.
He's going to lie about it at this debate.
They both are.
You're going to tell the truth.
You can't have it both ways, Governor.
We got him, period.
Unilateral, short-sighted action.
Unilateral because you and the general
pitted the Republicans against my involving the Russians.
That's just not true.
Are you saying that you did not
have the general contact members of the House Intelligence Committee?
General, would you care to comment?
When I resigned my commission,
I stopped talking to members of Congress
about matters of national security.
So you are saying that you did not?
No, ma'am. I did not.
You and I both know that you interfered, Governor.
You admitted so much to me when I asked you personally.
You told me that the general
had spoken to members of that committee.
I told you that I have friends on the committee,
which is true.
Not that I interfere with committee work.
You lined up every Republican
to be opposed to the Russians being involved.
It was unanimous opposition.
Well, if your plan was to get Russian support
by giving away drill sites, I don't blame them.
So just to be absolutely clear, for the record,
you are saying, Governor,
that neither you nor the General made any contact
with any member of the House Intelligence Committee?
I absolutely did not.
You're putting me in an impossible place here.
You put yourself there when you lied about your service record.
Whose lie do you want exposed?
Conway's or yours?
Go home and think about it.
Doesn't need to happen tomorrow.
It just needs to happen before Election Day.
I'm not trying to diminish your contribution
to your husband's presidency, Mrs. Underwood,
but I do question your experience.
No one's fully prepared to be President
when he or she becomes one.
Not even you.
And look at the polls.
Over half the country is open to a First Lady as VP.
And more than half of the country wants a new president.
It's true that you are leading in the polls for now, Governor,
but the gap has been closing in recent weeks.
Well, when people show up to vote
and have to confront the possibility
of Claire Underwood as President,
they're gonna have a gut check and make the right choice.
You're absolutely right. That means they'll vote for us.
Because they'll look around and realize
that if anything happens to me,
they'll be in very good hands with Claire.
And, you know, she's right.
No one can prepare to become the president.
But I have been the President,
and now I know what it takes.
It requires confidence, openness, effectiveness,
and Claire has all of those qualities.
I'm sorry, Mr. President. It...
It looks like we have to take a break.
We'll return shortly to the first-ever simultaneous debate
between presidential candidates and their running mates.
And we're clear.
Mr. President, Mrs. Underwood,
would you please come with me?
Read it.
What?
"We are citizens of the United States.
We have been taken hostage in the name of God
by the Islamic Caliphate Organization."
Read it.
"Our country is guilty of illegal aggression
and mass murder against Muslims.
We beg for mercy."
ICO will grant mercy only if these demands are met.
One, cessation of all U.S. Military activity in Syria.
Two, ten billion dollars in reparations paid to the Caliphate.
Three, the safe return of our leader,
Yusuf Al Ahmadi, from his unjust imprisonment.
We will not communicate with the criminal Frank Underwood.
We will only communicate with his successor, William Conway.
If these demands aren't met in  hours...
mercy will not be granted.
Released to seven outlets.
Encrypted email, Deep Web.
The hostages are Jim and Caroline Miller,
their daughter Melissa, from Knoxville.
Mr. President, whatever you need,
I'm here to offer assistance.
I'll let you know.
So far, we've identified the drywall and lighting.
All U.S. Manufactured.
The video was shot on a Panasonic HD camcorder,
most widely sold in the States.
So we know they're in the country.
Well, commercial flight is out.
Private plane is unlikely.
We're confident that they traveled by ground,
probably the Millers' hijacked car.
Last known location is a Denny's just outside of Knoxville.
A debit card transaction.
This is footage of them leaving the restaurant.
Our hearts go out to the Millers' family and loved ones.
But we're confident that the President
is doing everything possible to achieve their release.
I told the President that we'd be willing
to assist in any way if it would be helpful.
This is a time when America needs to pull together and...
Stop.
It's "pull together and pray for the Millers."
  And then I come in, and     I didn't forget.
I just feel this is wrong.
It implies we're willing to negotiate with terrorists.
We should keep our mouths shut.
Let the authorities do their job.
We don't get press by keeping our mouths shut.
You had me lie on national television.
And now you want us to send out some video
that only encourages these people?
And you wanna do that to score some press coverage?
If it doesn't make you feel comfortable,
I can do it on my own.
I'll be outside.
I've had enough of him.
He does have a point.
Look, they're gonna kill that family
whether we send this out or not.
We might as well say I was willing to show up for duty.
Well, I have to say, I agree with the General.
Press record.
Press record!
Our hearts go out to the Millers' family and loved ones...
What do we know about the captor?
Our Syrian assets say this is a lone wolf.
Two wolves, actually.
When we pumped up the contrast in the video,
we saw a shadow on the wall from someone behind the camera.
Voice analysis points to western Tennessee, Memphis area.
Uh, Mr. President, if I may?
Agent Holbrooke, our top negotiating expert.
Uh, we've run  possible models in preparation
for an incident like this.
Now, what we have here are key elements from three of them.
American kidnappers, the abduction of a child
and proxy communication...
Why did they want Conway?
That's the real question. I'll tell you why.
Because I would've done exactly the same thing if it had been me.
It undermines my authority.
Throws me off balance. Pits me against my rival.
And because I don't have children, and he does.
They know I won't compromise.
No president would.
But a would-be president like Conway, well, he might.
Tactically, we need more time.
I can't guarantee that we can
track them down in less than  hours.
Enough. Here's what I wanna do.
The president is working with the FBI
and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies
to locate the Millers.
Now, in order to protect the integrity of those efforts,
I won't be sharing any details on their progress at the moment.
In the meantime, the president
is reaching out to Governor Conway
should contact with the captors be established.
Now, let me be clear.
We're not talking about negotiation,
just communication.
You could've asked me privately first.
It was tactical, to show the kidnappers
that we respect their wishes.
This doesn't leave me a choice.
Well, you can always say no, Governor.
We have a plan for how we can
handle this without your participation.
How would that work?
Well, I say publicly that
I'm willing to speak to the captors myself.
Now, if they refuse,
we'd have to be prepared for the worst.
But our team believes that
you give us a better shot at opening a dialogue.
To negotiate.
To buy us time.
And if you do say yes,
we'd want you at the White House as soon as possible.
I need to discuss with my people.
I'm hoping that you'll agree to help us.
Either way, I'll need an answer soon.
I understand. I'll let you know within the hour.
Thank you, Governor.
Everyone has a flaw, and this is Conway's.
I spoke with the president, and I said that
I'm willing to assist in any way if it would be helpful.
He aches for the spotlight.
He feels almost invisible without it.
Now, if he's center stage on this,
he can't fault my performance,
because we're sharing the stage together.
If I get booed, he gets booed.
But it's really the applause that Conway's hungry for.
Trust me, he'll say yes.
The stage is too big
and the spotlight too tempting
for him to be... a mere spectator.
But I've already said publicly I'd assist if he asked.
That was a mistake,
and I should've pushed back on it more.
But you can't let him take advantage of it.
Well, I've said it. It's done.
And now we have to move forward.
This is fucking disgusting.
You say, "After much consideration,
I don't feel comfortable negotiating with terrorists."
And then I come off not only as a liar,
but as a coward.
Why do this when we're ahead?
By what? Five points? That's not a lead.
That's a coin toss.
My message this entire campaign
has been about serving the country, showing up for duty,
and now I'm gonna not show up when the Commander-in-Chief
has asked for my help?
...and the speech patterns.
The captor is the one who you heard on the camera.
Seems to be American.
And the way he's released the video shows
he's computer savvy.
Now, ICO recruiters have been turning to social media networks
like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
to initiate contact with users sympathetic to their cause.
  Oh, Tom.   Earlier groups, like al-Qaeda,
didn't use social networking
anywhere near the degree that ICO has.
It is possible that this captor...
  Mr. President.   Good flight?
  A little bumpy, but fine.   Come on in.
You play?
Well, that's debatable.
But I definitely collect.
Uh, this is something.
Yeah, it's terrible.
I don't envy Frank right now.
Have a seat.
  Coffee? Tea?   No, thanks.
I appreciate you taking the time,
given everything that's going on.
It's not as though anyone's calling for my advice.
Although I'm not sure this article is pertinent at the moment.
I'm not here about your scholarship fund.
I don't understand. My assistant said you wanted to write  
I lied... so you'd meet with me.
We have a domestic surveillance program, beta phase,
aimed at finding ICO recruits.
I was briefed when we got the FISA court ruling.
Well, this is a domestic investigation.
We have to work through the FBI.
Now, they're sending over a team,
and I'd like for Homeland and the CIA to join them.
This is a sensitive program. Shouldn't you keep it in-house?
We've been criticized for
not involving other agencies in the past.
I'd like to avoid that.
  You want clearances?   As soon as possible.
It's all hands on deck, Doug.
  Governor.   Mr. President.
Well, and this must be Charlie.
Charlie... Shake the President's hand, Charlie.
  Come on, Charlie.   You said he was a vampire.
Well, don't worry. You're safe here.
No monsters in the White House.
I'll show you where you're staying.
Okay. Come on, Charlie.
Have you ever been in the Oval?
Once, when I was a kid.
My Boy Scout troop, we met with Reagan.
Of course they did.
I thought you'd all like to be together,
so I've put you in here,
but, if not, we can put the kids in the Lincoln Bedroom.
No, this is wonderful. Thank you.
Is this where we're gonna live, Mommy?
We'll have to see how the election goes first.
Something smells.
Oh, gosh. Lily needs a change.
Um, where  
The restroom is here, to the right.
Great, thank you.
You want me to put a Republican in the White House.
You want a Republican or a criminal?
I still have loyalty to my party, Tom.
And where's their loyalty?
They were going to impeach you.
Jackie Sharp whipped Democrats.
Your own Secretary of State turned her back.
Your party? It's rotten to the core.
And the core is Underwood.
Aren't you angry that he stole your presidency?
I'm angry.
I'm angry at myself...
for not seeing it.
And for not fighting it.
So do something now.
I wanted to say Tusk lied.
But once I got the pardon, I knew nobody would believe me.
I thought...
"Just disappear. Go away."
And that anger...
If I went away...
that anger would go away.
The truth is coming out.
Be part of the truth.
People will believe you.
Once we finish with the press conference, you'll be done.
We'll take it from there.
You don't want me on the call if they contact us?
Oh, you're only there for bait, Governor.
I can't have you speaking on behalf of the White House.
They said they wanted me.
Yes, we have a roadmap in place.
Then you'll have to adjust it.
What right do you have to walk in here
and dictate how we're gonna handle this?
I put myself on the line coming here, and you know it.
I could've backed off and left this pile of shit in your lap.
Now, if I'm gonna be exposed with you,
then I'm gonna have some say in how that happens.
Or I head back to New York and watch you squirm.
Just as I'd hoped.
The more involved, the better.
Director Green, please.
They here?
  They're here.   Thanks.
This is our director.
  Hello.   President's Chief of Staff.
We need every white male under 
with geo-local anomalies in the past  hours.
Already done that, cross-referenced with your watchlists.
We're voice matching with phone calls now.
Well, we're bringing a team in here.
FBI, CIA, Homeland, along with our own people.
Uh, yeah, more cooks in the kitchen won't  
I've cleared them.
We can't waste time grapevining this.
Let's get everyone working from the same place.
We need to organize workflow.
Right. Uh, let's talk in my office.
It's the second door on the right.
Is this going to be a problem?
I'd prefer them not breathing down my neck.
That wasn't my question.
I told you, we're masked.
Thank you. Please be seated.
I'd like to thank Governor Conway for agreeing to assist us.
He and I share the same goal,
which is the safe return of the Millers.
In order to achieve that,
we're willing to open up lines
of communication with their captors.
Governor.
I will act as intermediary between you and the president.
To communicate with us,
dial Jim Miller's social security number followed by Caroline's
into any phone or Internet conferencing service.
There will be a voice recognition prompt.
Have all three Millers say their names and state the time
and that will connect you.
Our hearts are with the Millers and their families.
I spoke to their siblings and their parents last night,
and they remain strong.
And I would ask all Americans to remain strong on their behalf.
Thank you very much.
Deplorable as this situation is,
we cannot blame Islam as a whole
or the millions of Muslims in our nation who yearn for peace,
who contribute to our society,
who have the same dreams as all Americans do.
ICO does not represent Islam.
But there are those who would use this incident
to justify draconian measures,
like travel restrictions or forced registration,
who would espouse hatred or even violence.
The moment bigotry becomes a form of patriotism,
America is no longer America.
That is why I'm here today, in the Capitol,
to urge our congressmen and women...
Hear there's a push to get the ten billion.
Big debate in Ways and Means,
but it'll never make it to the floor.
It's just for show.
I've been with Appropriations.
  Bypass Ways and Means?   No.
To pay for more ground troops in Syria if we need them.
So why are you meeting me instead of at the Capitol?
Tom Hammerschmidt.
Has he called you, too?
He reached out, but I haven't said a word.
Walker went on record.
Told him I was the one who whipped the votes for impeachment.
Your story is you thought he was guilty.
There's nothing wrong with that.
So you have talked to him?
He has some theories.
All I did was shake my head at the parts that weren't right.
You're clean if you don't talk.
I want to. On the record.
I think you should, too.
We can't.
You will lose your seat as soon as those photos are leaked.
I may lose my seat anyway.
Conway's super PAC is targeting
every California Democrat in a tight race.
Even if I win, I'm in a Republican-controlled Congress
with a Republican president...
or I have to do Underwood's bidding for the next four years.
What about Alan?
I told him about us.
He was kind about it.
We'll divorce once everything quiets down.
If you don't want the photos out there, I won't say anything.
I don't care about what the rest of the world thinks of me.
All I cared about was protecting you.
Then let's do this, Remy.
You and I go on the record, he's done.
Joshua Masterson. Computer science major at Tennessee Tech.
Taken a keen interest in Islamic studies
during the past two years.
Hasn't been to class in three days.
None of his friends or family have heard from him.
Voice matches the one in the video.
We believe his associate is Zachary Hawthorne,
high school dropout who's remained close with Masterson.
Stopped showing up for work last Tuesday.
So if they call, should I...
should I tell them that we know who they are?
No, you'll introduce yourself, Governor,
then you introduce me.
No, the governor will do the talking,
so should he use their names or not?
It could cause them to do something rash.
Agent March, our head psychologist.
So I shouldn't.
Conversely, it could humanize them.
Removes the confidence of anonymity.
But if they run, it compromises everything.
Not just that. We're confident on the IDs,
but if there's the slightest chance we're wrong,
it weakens our position.
Then don't use their names in the call.
Uh, sir, our script is written
with the understanding that I'd be speaking.
We'd have to rework it for the governor.
Well, then let's rework it now.
We don't know when they'll be calling.
You know, the circumstances are awful,
but I have to admit...
it's been nice to take a break from the road.
I don't know how you do it,
running mate and First Lady.
I'm still trying to figure that out myself, actually.
I think it's admirable.
If we win,
I'd love to do something more than update my Instagram.
When I criticized that, it was just because  
No, not at all. I didn't take offense.
It's politics.
I'd love to do something like your gun bill.
It's a shame it didn't pass the Senate.
You support that legislation?
Mmm, I'm from England.
We think your gun obsession is madness.
Will does, too, but he can't admit it.
  Mustn't upset the base.   Ah, yes, the base.
Mustn't upset the base.
You know, you're actually a role model of mine.
I mean, your work on the environment,
sexual assault, being ambassador...
I mean, obviously, I'd prefer if we win.
But if we didn't,
I think you'd make a wonderful Vice President.
Mommy, what are you drinking?
It's coffee, sweetheart.
I want some! I want some!
Not so loud. You'll wake your sister.
Can I have some?
You're not old enough.
But do you want some water or some juice?
I think we've got some juice in the fridge.
I'll get it.
He's very cute.
Do you regret it, not having children?
Oh, I'm sorry. That's too personal.
Do you ever regret having them?
We've got voice verification. They're on the line, sir.
Do I need to keep them engaged so you can trace the call?
No, Internet call.
Rerouted every three milliseconds. Untraceable.
We have two main objectives.
More information, extending the deadline.
But our top priority is a first concession. Proof of life.
So you'll promise nothing.
Okay.
Keep in mind that they may be recording this call.
It's publicity they want.
Okay, I'm ready.
This is Governor Conway.
I'd like to speak with Jim, Caroline and Melissa.
You speak to me.
I need some proof that they're still alive.
Please tell Melissa that her grandparents miss her very much
and, uh, they are praying for her.
You're not gonna make us feel sorry for 'em.
How sorry did you feel
when you dropped bombs on innocent Muslims, Governor?
The President's a coward. He sends others to do his killing.
But you're worse.
You make speeches about how proud you are
that you fought in an unjust war.
How would you feel if a bomb was dropped on your daughter?
If she was blown up and had to be buried in pieces?
You're American, right?
Our allegiance is to Yusuf Al Ahmadi
and the Islamic Caliphate.
America is our enemy and must meet our demands.
Uh, you understand that
I can't speak on behalf of the government.
I can only communicate what you say to the President.
I'll need some time.
You think we're stupid? He's listening right now.
This is the President speaking.
We talk to Conway only.
But if you want anything to happen,
I'm the one that can make it so.
Then why have you done nothing?
I'm talking to Congress about the money.
I'm consulting with my military advisers about a pullout,
but nothing can happen in a few hours.
You just want more time so you can find us.
Are we looking for you? Yes.
But that's only so you'll turn over the Millers without incident.
But there is no handing over.
Either you give us what we want or we kill them.
Nothing will happen until we have proof of life.
All right, here's your proof of life.
Cut out the girl's tongue.
  No!   This is Conway.
  No!   Please, before you do anything...
  Mommy!   Josh. Zach.
Do you think we care you know who we are?
No, stop!
I'd like to speak with you, just for a moment.
I... I have something to say,
but I need Melissa to stop screaming
  so I can hear you.   No!
Can I hear her voice?
We need her voice.
I'm here. I'm Melissa.
Hi, Melissa. My name is Will  
You heard her voice. Now talk.
Oh, no.
Yes, I... I've killed a lot of people.
Some of them innocent people.
And every single night...
I haven't even told my wife this...
but every single night, I have nightmares.
I picture my own daughter, Lily,
and my wife... and my son,
just like you described...
blown away.
Gone.
Now, you could say that I...
I have these demons because what I did was wrong
and that your cause is righteous.
But I believed that my cause was righteous, too.
And if I could take it all back...
I wouldn't do it again.
The truth is...
I'm ashamed of what I've done.
Now, the president is right.
We need more time to work on your demands,
but more importantly,
I'm guessing you've never killed anyone before.
And speaking as someone who knows what it means to kill,
you owe yourselves more time
before you do something you can never take back.
Josh?
They've ended the call.
You did an excellent job, Governor.
Thank you.
We have a recording of the Situation Room call
released by the captors a short while ago.
Before playing this audio, we want to warn viewers
that there are sections that are very disturbing.
You might want to mute the television.
Where is everybody?
They all got pulled on the hostage story.
Get 'em back here.
And Maggie Tilden, too.
Transcribe this, right away.
Fifty mile radius outside of Chattanooga.
Gas purchase on a stolen credit card.
One of Masterson's classmates.
Should we just release their photographs at this point?
I'm getting bombarded with calls.
Well, the governor used the first names.
Someone's gonna put it together.
  We might as well exploit it.   Sir.
  George.   Mr. President.
Normally, I'd give you time to reconsider,
but time is in short supply today.
I can't. Not to my party.
The party will survive.
Conway might not, but too bad. He lied.
If I do this to him, I don't survive.
I'm vilified.
I wanna show you something.
Do you know what this is?
This is your magnet
from the vote count board when I used to be whip.
There were so many times when you weren't in the column
I wanted you to be in, George.
And we both know that I could've forced you
to vote the way I wanted you to dozens of times,
but I never did. I held back.
To protect your honor.
And one of the advantages of being whip
is that behind every single member,
behind all of these magnets,
was at least one dishonorable thing.
Yours just happens to be more dishonorable than most.
So I'm putting you in my column this time, George.
LeAnn told me you were in here.
I'm working on your statements,
in case the worst happens.
It's tense, this building.
You can feel it in the walls.
I went for a walk earlier.
It was in the air.
People were talking in whispers,
even though there was no reason to.
Or their eyes are glued to their phones.
And there are no children out...
anywhere.
I guess they call it terror for a reason.
Worse than terror. Dread.
People girding themselves for a tragedy.
Mmm, and it could go the other way.
How are you holding up?
Hannah is minding her children.
I'm minding her.
Her husband really knocked it out of the ballpark, huh?
Do you think anything he says is genuine?
Doesn't matter, does it?
It worked.
You said once you thought he was all surface, Conway.
Yeah, a narcissist.
But give him a pool to reflect in...
Watch out.
He knows exactly what to do with that.
Unless he overreaches.
Is that what you were hoping?
That he was gonna fuck it up?
Because he's not gonna fuck it up.
He's too smart for that.
"There he soared,
zipping past Big Ben and the London Eye,
over Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly Circus.
Look at him go."
I'll be right back, Charlie.
... the vigil is especially somber,
but there remains a great deal of hope
after the deadline was extended earlier this morning.
  Many credit that extension to Governor...   What's the latest?
Progress. They've narrowed the search zone.
During the call, Melissa could be heard screaming
as Masterson orders Hawthorne to, quote, "Cut out..."
Left of the sink.
That's when Governor Conway stepped in.
Oh, I'm sorry. You want one?
No, thank you.
We're going to play some of what he said right now.
  Is it your liver?   Yes, I...
  Clear mind.   I've killed a lot of people.
Some of them innocent people.
And every  
Oh, why'd you turn it off?
I was there.
That's gotta drive you crazy, huh?
How much good press I'm getting out of this.
  What's funny?   Nothing.
Come on, tell me. I want in on the joke.
You think you can get under my skin.
Oh, I got under your skin the first time we met.
When? New Year's?
I believe I complimented you that night.
But you go ahead,
you tell yourself what you have to
in order to stand a little taller.
I feel sorry for you.
Two years.
That's all you're gonna get in here.
You're not gonna last any longer than Walker did.
And what kills you is that I'll make a great president.
The kind of president who'll actually be remembered.
And isn't that worse than dying, Frank?
Being forgotten.
You actually think you'd make a great president.
Today was just a little taste.
I mean, you had your little moment in the sun today,
but what are you gonna do
when you have to make a thousand decisions
that no one will ever hear about or appreciate?
I think you're excellent at running for the president,
but I don't think you're equipped to actually be one.
Don't be condescending.
I'm the Governor of New York.
Ooh, Albany, really?
You're a pretender, Will.
And if you win,
you'll go from pretender to fraud.
Will?
I'm putting the kids to bed.
Don't let me keep you.
  Maybe you should send them home.   No, not yet.
Do you have something else in mind besides Walleck?
Yes, and I'll need your help.
Charlie? Have you seen him?
Charlie?
Mommy, look what I found!
Oh, look at those.
Give those back. Those aren't yours to play with.
  Can I keep them?   Oh, um, hand them over, Charlie.
  Charles.   No, you know what?
You should keep them,
because you should get everything you want in this life.
Um, say thank you.
  Thank you.   No, thank you
for coming to the White House to visit us.
We should get some rest. I'll see you at :.
Oh, I'll be up way before then.
  Good night.   Good night.
Good night.
You need my help how?
  Who else knows about this?   No one.
I'll need you to make arrangements as quietly as possible.
All right, I'm on it.
I'll let you know as soon as I have a location.
Good. Then go home and get a few hours of sleep.
I can't sleep tonight.
You should try. We'll need you fresh in the morning.
  Get me the Chairman Joint Chiefs.   Yes, sir.
He's on the line, sir.
Mr. Chairman.
When do you wanna reach out to the White House?
Tomorrow. I've drafted the email.
  You looked this over?   Yes.
We're okay on the legal front.
But shouldn't we wait until this crisis is over first?
No. This is perfect timing for us.
Tom's right. Let's hit him while he's distracted.
How is it?
Perfect.
Well, you didn't have much to work with in your fridge.
You need to do some grocery shopping.
  I don't cook a lot.   Obviously.
If you have to get back to your kids...
No, it's fine.
Haley's . She'll call me if she needs anything.
Have they been watching the news?
Yeah... and they're freaked out by it.
I mean, who isn't? But they've got thick skin by now.
Handling it a lot better than some of their friends.
I know a lot of parents aren't
even letting their kids out of the house tomorrow.
Not even to go to school.
My kids are gonna go, though.
I'm not gonna let these monsters rule over our lives.
  Thanks for coming over.   Of course.
I know I'd just be staring at the ceiling if I tried to sleep.
Well, you have a lot on your shoulders.
Yeah, normally, I'd go to a meeting.
I... I just, uh...
You just wanted someone to take care of you.
And it's nice to take care of someone.
Good morning, Governor.
Your phone.
Hello?
We have video of a car
at an intersection near Chatsworth, Georgia.
The bird song, deep background from the phone call,
puts them in a wooded area. Southern Blue Ridge.
We started canvassing now.
FBI, state troopers.
The line is open.
Uh, okay. Where... where's my script?
I'll be doing the talking.
I'll let you know if I want you to participate.
Sir, if we've established a dialogue
between the kidnappers and the governor, we should  
Start the call.House.of.Cards.SE
This is the president.
  Put on Conway.   You will speak to me.
No, we only talk to him or we hang up.
Do you hear the helicopters yet? Or the dogs?
We're getting closer and we will find you.
The only question is will you work with us
before we get there?
The money's not happening and neither is the military withdrawal.
But you're smart enough to know that.
The objective here is Ahmadi,
and that's what I'd like to discuss.
Well, the choice is yours.
You either meet our demands or you don't.
I spoke at length last night with Governor Conway.
I was of a mind to ignore your call this morning,
but he convinced me that we should keep talking.
Isn't that right, Governor?
  I just want a peaceful resolution.   As do I.
You wanted to include the Governor, I want to include Ahmadi.
  You're trying to stall.   You refusing to speak to your leader?
Is he on now?
You release the Millers, then we put him on.
No, you don't get to dictate terms.
We show good will when you show good will.
I'm giving you ten seconds to reconsider your position.
After that, we disconnect the call.
Insha'Allah. We'll kill them.
Ten seconds, starting now.
Five seconds.
  End the call.   One hostage.
  All three.   One.
Give us the daughter and the mother.
No, we keep the girl.
You managed to get the president of the United States on the phone
not once, but twice.
You will release the daughter and the mother
or you will never hear from me again,
and you will lose your chance to speak to your leader.
Tell me now.
They've disconnected, sir.
Stop.
Mr. Ahmadi.
You can shower upstairs. There's fresh clothes in the closet.
The only people who know are the Chairman
and the SEALs who escorted him.
  Do we have a secure line?   Direct to the Oval.
Mr. President...
I would have never condoned bringing Ahmadi into this.
Well, lucky for me, I'm not making decisions
based on what you would or would not condone.
Watch me tell the press you put words in my mouth.
Feel free.
I think they'll have a hard time believing you, though.
Check your messages. I'm sure your staff's been emailing you.
Arrange for a car to get the governor and his family to the airport.
Have a safe trip back to New York.
I've had lunch brought in.
I'm sure it's been quite a while since you've had a hot meal.
  I won't be eating it.   Aren't you hungry?
I don't wanna get sick while I'm being tortured.
No one's getting tortured. Please, have a seat.
You want me to tell these men to release the family, right?
If I don't, you'll do what you have to do.
Oh, if we had any intention of that,
you never would have left Guantanamo.
Nor would I be here.
Where is here?
Virginia, in a government safe house.
And why you?
Out of respect... for the gravity of this situation.
I think your intention is to humiliate me.
You've been properly clothed, offered food.
How are we humiliating you?
I'm sitting across from a woman.
There's no reason to keep up the facade.
You and your brother are not fundamentalists,
nor are you Syrian.
This what the CIA's feeding you?
You're Iraqi. Your real name is Al Awad.
Actually, it says that you joined
the Baath Party in .
You were the assistant to the
undersecretary of infrastructure, , .
Say whatever you want.
My brother will deny. You won't convince anyone but yourselves.
We expel the Baathists
and you go from a bureaucrat to an extremist.
But you're a well-educated man, Yusuf...
and you don't care about Islam or the caliphate.
You're just using that to radicalize soldiers.
Just as you use democracy and freedom.
So now we understand each other.
Yusuf Al Ahmadi remains in solitary confinement in Guantanamo.
If Caroline and Melissa Miller are released,
we will allow supervised contact with the kidnappers.
Mark.
Ahmadi has consistently encouraged acts of terror like this one.
What makes you think that any sort of dialogue
will lead to a peaceful resolution?
Well, the alternative is no dialogue at all.
We don't wanna leave any stone unturned.
Sara.
Will you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article
about Governor Conway's alleged interference
with the House Intelligence Committee?
Well, it confirms what we suspected to be true,
but I think you want the governor's comment, not ours.
Congressman Walleck is misrepresenting events.
  You're saying he lied?   I'm saying he misrepresented.
I have a number of friends on the Intelligence Committee,
and do I speak with them sometimes? Of course.
But that's not the same as interfering.
So you never discussed the Russia plan
with anyone on the committee?
We may have discussed it,
but it's not as though I was issuing orders.
And I have to say, everyone's primary focus right now
needs to be on the Miller family, not this.
Did the president ask you to leave the White House?
Uh, we agreed that I'd done my part,
and that the rest is up to him.
Can you tell us about your conversation last night
with the president, regarding Ahmadi?
That'll be all for now. Thank you so much.
Question, sir.
Let's go.
Uh, hold on, I'm still fastening Lily's car seat.
  Will     Not a word.
Well, I have to tell you, the general's apeshit
over what you said about being ashamed of your service.
He may talk to the press.
Nobody does any press until we have a proper response
to all this shit.
Daddy said "Shit." Shit, shit, shit!
Stop it!
You need to bring me something on Walleck.
We need to discredit him.
  Are you done yet?   You don't need to snap at us.
  Are you done yet?   Yes.
Let's go. Now.
That's if they're released.
We'll fill in the blanks once we have details.
This is if the worst happens.
Yates wrote these?
No, I... I took a stab at it first.
Also, Tom Hammerschmidt called.
He wants an interview with the president.
He wouldn't say what for.
What outlet is he with now?
He's back at the Herald. Said he emailed you directly.
I need the room.
Everyone out.
Get me the Herald.
Tom Hammerschmidt.
Well, there's a cell tower here.
Uh, typically very low traffic,
but it showed higher usage during the time of the call,
especially the southeastern antenna.
So we should be able to ping the hotspot, zero in?
Eh, it's hundreds of tower faces.
I can give you the general area,
but pinpointing will take longer.
I can't even guarantee it's gonna be them.
I want every one of those towers analyzed.
Well, we're better off concentrating on ambient background sound.
If I can match that to other calls made
in this area around the same time as  
I'm not asking your advice.
I'm telling you what I want you to do.
Focus on the tower data.
We were concentrating on this area,
but it looks like they're closer to here.
We've got ground teams setting up a search grid.
Can we use satellites?
We are, but there are over  possible structures
within the zone.
  Each one of them needs to be checked.   How long?
If we get lucky, within hours. If not, could be tomorrow.
Sir, Mr. Stamper's here.
  He says it's urgent.   Thank you.
Hammerschmidt says they go online today,
whether you comment or not.
Travel logs are not hard evidence.
These quotes are circumstantial.
But all of it combined... I don't know how we spin this.
He's got heavy hitters on the record.
Should I release the photos of Jackie and Remy?
They told him about the affair.
He's putting in the article that we threatened to expose them.
How did this happen?
This is as much on you.
I can put together a list of the people he hasn't gotten to yet.
And give him proof of a cover-up?
He's right. If we reach out to Tusk or Lanagin  
I want Hammerschmidt here.
  Sir, I wasn't suggesting     Set it up as soon as possible.
The U.S. Government will never recognize the caliphate.
No, of course not.
But we can reintegrate the Baathists into the government.
What government? There's no government in Iraq.
There is no Iraq. There's Baghdad.
Shia, Sunni, Kurd...
Syria is the same.
You maintained order before we shut you out.
Now, we can't support a theocracy,
but we can put the military back in control.
What do we do with all the soldiers we've recruited?
They won't accept a secular government.
You'll keep them in check.
With force, if necessary.
Use our guns on the men who carried it for us.
What does it matter... if you have back your power?
If this is your intention, why have you said nothing publicly?
Because you know that all of this
has to be done behind closed doors.
We need to give the appearance that we neutralized ICO.
What happens if they don't release the hostages?
Well, then you go back to Cuba.
If they do, then we put you on the phone with them...
and you tell them to release the third.
And then you send me back to Cuba anyway.
I do understand why you don't trust us,
but what is the alternative?
These people die, and then it gives us all the justification we need
for a full offensive.
That's years...
and you won't completely destroy us.
Not completely, but enough to make you irrelevant.
Or we can quietly work together.
ICO fades, and you and your generals get control.
  Do you know where Claire is?   No, we're trying to find her.
She usually keeps me informed if she's going somewhere.
Have you asked Secret Service?
  They didn't know.   They have to know.
  I'll go ask again.   Thanks.
She wasn't at the residence.
  You went up there?   Ten minutes ago.
What's going on between you two?
You think I haven't noticed?
How you two talk? How often you're here?
I don't even have unrestricted access to the residence.
I was with her when her mother died.
It made us close.
Don't read too much into it.
Well, however close you are,
just make sure that nobody else can read too much into it.
Well, if you see Claire, tell her I went home.
If she needs me.
Don't meet face-to-face.
Have him submit the questions in writing.
Yeah, but if I meet with him, maybe I can give him pause.
No, he's trying to trap you into giving something away.
That's not going to happen.
  The timing on this     How's your end?
He's getting there.
Well, you focus on him. I'll handle Hammerschmidt.
Are you smoking?
  How did you know?   I can hear it.
If this story comes out,
it won't be the smoking that does us in.
Have they been killed?
You look upset.
Do you miss your wife?
You don't care about my wife.
Ah, I don't care about either of you...
whether you live or die... or your children do.
But if speaking to your family once a month will get us there,
I'll put that on the table.
I haven't seen my wife in three years.
I have a son I've never met, a daughter that doesn't remember me.
This is our path.
Even if they're killed?
Yes.
Because they will be.
I'm willing to die, and so are they.
  Would they have made that choice?   What choice?
All they've known are your bombs.
Poof, gone.
We're effective
because we make you feel the pain.
We've felt it all our lives.
Yes?
  Tom.   Mr. President.
I'm gonna ask that everything we discuss today is off the record.
  Understood.   Now, the last time we met,
it was in the vice president's office,
and you claim that I acquired that office by manipulating Matthews.
I don't claim that. President Walker does.
Oh, yes. A man made bitter by his own mistakes.
And you also claim that I then acquired this office
by pushing out that very same man.
  Danton and Sharp corroborated.   Oh, yes.
Two people with very big chips on their shoulders,
fabricating all this nonsense to justify their infidelity.
You're saying you didn't blackmail them?
I pressure a lot of people, Tom.
That's part of politics.
But never those two.
Danton's parents say
LeAnn Harvey came to their house in Miami.
Well, I imagine that's because he wanted LeAnn on the Russian plan.
Then why did she come to him instead of him coming to her?
Look, I'm not gonna get into the weeds on this,
but let's just cut to the chase.
The allegations that you're making
are just as ludicrous as they were the first time we met.
I had nothing concrete then. This time I do.
Three people with an ax to grind,
no hard evidence and some travel logs?
I'd hardly call that concrete.
It's enough for a story.
You're floating an idea out of thin air.
Let's just call this what it is: blatant sensationalism
  tied to the election     I don't float.
Tied to an election to boost your circulation
because the Herald is losing readership.
Sir, I don't float stories to see if they're seaworthy,
and I don't give a shit about circulation.
The only thing I care about is the truth.
The truth? So have you reached out to Raymond Tusk
for a comment? Or Daniel Lanagin?
I don't see their quotes in here.
I mean, if you're going for the truth,
doesn't that include being thorough? Being balanced?
Which is why I'm giving you an opportunity to comment.
And what about any members of Congress?
I don't see their quotes in here.
I'm sure they'll answer my calls once this article comes out.
Oh, I think you're afraid to make those calls,
'cause you know they'll see this for what it is...
unsupported tabloid gossip.
The assistant whip, your former Chief of Staff,
an ex-president of the United States.
That's not gossip. It's news.
There's no way the Justice Department doesn't open up an inquiry.
And if they don't, the Republicans in Congress will.
Downplay this all you want, but you know where this story leads.
I know what this story is.
Political sabotage, plain and simple.
Margaret Tilden used to have some integrity, Tom.
And so did you.
Why are you wasting America's time with this,
in the middle of this crisis?
Where is your conscience?
That's the question I want you to answer.
Yes?
Sir, they emailed a location of the mother and daughter.
Will you please show Mr. Hammerschmidt into the Roosevelt Room?
There's no need. I'll be going.
Oh, no, no, no. You and I are not done, Tom.
Caroline and Melissa Miller were rescued
Eastern Standard Time by FBI field agents.
Aside from the psychological trauma of their ordeal,
both are unharmed and healthy.
I'll be calling them soon, and I hope to meet them soon,
once they have had their full medical examinations.
And while I am greatly relieved to have them both safe,
James Miller remains in danger.
And we will not rest until I can come to this podium
and make another announcement like this one,
informing you of his safe return.
Mr. Grayson will answer any questions you may have.
I must get back to work. Thank you all very much.
They're alive. You can take some credit for that.
I'm sure Underwood's flying them to the White House right now.
That's the image everyone will remember.
The warm embrace, the reassuring words.
I mean, he's not gonna let me take one ounce of credit for this.
If they choose to talk with the media, however,
we will certainly facilitate that.
I will now take some of your questions.
What if it were Lily and me?
Will, what if it were me and Lily?
Would this be your thinking?
  "The political fallout"?   Don't, Hannah.
Don't get weak on me.
I can confirm that that is an area where our focus is,
but that's about as much detail as I can go into.
Have the kidnappers made contact?
And if so,
did you put them in touch with Ahmadi?
They have not made contact. We encourage them to do so.
And, yes, the offer still stands.
  Mary.   Uh, what assurances do you have
that Ahmadi will say what you want him to?
We don't, and we can't force him to.
But we're hoping that he will work with us on this.
Who's managing the call from his side in Cuba?
I'm sorry, I can't go into details on that.
Both were blindfolded in the car,
but the mother estimates a drive time of  minutes.
That narrows the search to six structures.
Unless they're on the move.
If they're past the roadblocks already,
they've gotta stop somewhere to make the call.
And we've had some progress on tracing the call.
You're taking my algorithms.
We need more teams on this. There is not enough room here.
You know my instructions were never
to let anything leave this building.
We have an order from the director.
Well, if you put more teams on this, it'll cause confusion.
Go home, Mr. Macallan. You've been here for two days straight.
I am not leaving this in the hands of people
who do not know what they're doing.
We've got it covered.
Go home. Get some rest. We'll let you know if we need you.
These boys don't wanna kill anyone.
If they did, they wouldn't have released two hostages.
They're actually looking for an excuse to back out.
If the media plays that video, I look like a traitor.
We tell them it's a precondition.
If they share it, the deal is off.
How do I know you won't?
I can't force you to believe me...
but we are hours from finding them.
And you know how this goes.
Jim Miller dies. They die.
You go back to Cuba. We go to war.
We're already at war.
Yusuf, you have one chance
to change the conditions at home.
You squander it, you destroy everything you have ever fought for.
What do you know about fighting for anything?
We're done here. Send him back.
All right.
I'll do what you ask.
Put him back in his jumpsuit. We'll film in the basement.
Yes, ma'am.
Tell the senator I'll call him when I get back.
  Mr. President.  Oh, Cathy.
I realize we haven't had a chance to discuss everything.
We'll talk foreign policy consequences
once we've resolved this hostage situation.
It's not that. The Herald contacted me.
A reporter called my office. I've read the email.
  You didn't call them back?   'Course not.
All right. Don't do or say anything. I'll handle it.
  How?   I don't know yet.
Walker says we conspired for Secretary of State,
and saying I gave him asylum during the investigation.
If they publish this, I get skinned alive, too.
We're going to be all right, Cathy. Trust me on this.
I just spoke with Secretary Durant.
We have a timeline.
My folks don't hear from me,
they start making calls on the hour.
Durant was first.
Birch is next.
Then Womack.
Michael Kern.
It was Zoe's article that ruined his chances.
You knew her. You were in her neighborhood.
This is irresponsible, Tom.
When the whole nation is in the middle of this major terror threat.
That's the same reasoning dictators use.
You remind me a little bit of Kate Baldwin.
You've lost your objectivity.
Uh, it's funny you mention her.
Kate thought Lucas was onto something. I told her to let it go,
that there wasn't anything there, but there was.
Well, where are the facts? Facts, not quotes. Facts.
You wanna see a fact?
This is a fact.
I told you he was crazy, and there's the proof.
He had the facts wrong, but he had the story right.
He saw through you.
So what is the story? That I'm some sort of psychopath?
That I'm a killer?
Oh, I never believed you were a murderer, and I still don't.
But it's becoming harder not to entertain the thought.
Well, should I get you a gun, so you can shoot me, too?
He was right about your soul.
What's in your bones.
That you're ruthless. You're corrupt.
You destroy whatever's in your path.
Name me a president you wouldn't describe in exactly the same way.
We're all ruthless. We all destroy.
But corruption? That's a matter of perspective.
No.
It's a matter of law.
All right, you seem a little confused here, Tom.
One moment you're talking about my soul,
and the next moment you want to get legal.
Let's at least achieve some clarity here today, shall we?
You want the real story?
Zoe Barnes?
Yes, we knew each other. Professionally.
I scratched her back and she scratched mine.
And you printed all of it.
You were her source for the education bill.
  And Michael Kern.   You sabotaged him.
Okay, ask yourself why I would have done all those things.
Because the education bill was a disaster,
and I had to move the president off of it.
Because Michael Kern was a terrible choice for Secretary of State.
We could do better, and we did, with Cathy.
I was trying to help Walker.
I was trying to steer a weak president in the right direction.
Now, you want to print that story, you go right ahead.
But the rest of it is just nonsense.
You didn't make any deals with Raymond Tusk?
  Absolutely not.   Then why did you pardon him?
Same reason I pardoned Walker.
Because the country had to move on.
You didn't orchestrate his impeachment?
Why would I want to impeach a president
I was working so hard to help?
You're still here. He's not.
I was trying to save him from himself.
Unfortunately, I failed.
  Do you trust your instincts, Tom?   I always have.
Then look me in the eye.
I've told you the truth.
What you said...
is it on the record now?
Do you believe me?
Not for a second.
Then, no. Not a word.
We'll give you a few hours if you want to make an official comment.
I'm ready to go now.
If they release the father, you're a hero.
It's not enough. I don't know how we survive this story.
My mind keeps racing, over and over and over again.
What we could've done differently.
How we could've covered our tracks.
The people we should've kept closer...
I'm frightened, Claire.
If we can't stop the damage,
we have to control it, Francis.
There is a solution. There always is.
Hold on.
They're on, sir.
We just got word.
  They've called in.   Yes, I was just told.
All right, this first. One thing at a time.
  The link is up?   Yes, ma'am.
We've located the building.
Matches the description from Caroline Miller
and the drive time from where they were found.
Are we certain that they're there?
No, sir, but we have a team en route.
Let's see how the phone call goes,
and then we'll decide if we're gonna move.
The line is open.
Go ahead.
  This is the president.   Where's Ahmadi?
We're about to connect him via video,
so you know that he's speaking freely.
But before we do, be aware
that if you release any of this call to the media,
anything we discuss will be off the table.
Put him on.
Assalam-alaikum.
Walaikum-assalam.
I know you are trying to free me.
English.
Listen to me.
You've already done your duty.
You have made the world pay attention.
But the U.S. Government, they will not free me.
And if you harm this man,
they'll bring more bloodshed on Muslims.
Let him go.
They have promised me they will only charge you for kidnapping...
not as terrorists.
Are they forcing you to say this?
No.
Who are you looking to?
Off.
They've hung up.
What did he just say?
What did you say?
Tell me what you said.
I'm not a traitor.
Keep him down here.
"Release the video.
If they don't send me home, kill them.
If they find you, kill him.
Make sure you have proof that I  " And then it goes black.
Where that leaves us, we don't know right now.
The White House has not briefed the press or issued any statement  
What do I say to this?
  We say nothing.   No, I can't say nothing,
'cause I got  reporters that are about to break down that door.
We are not going to expose ourselves
until we have something concrete to go on.
Like the guy's head rolling? Or are you saying nothing then, too?
Or how about the Herald article?
When that comes out, are you gonna say nothing?
Seth...
Look, I will lock myself up in here.
I'll bury my head in the sand.
But eventually, it's me that has to face these people.
All right, I can't hide the way that you  
Stop. Stop!
Keep your shit together.
Okay?
Eat some food. Rest your eyes for a little bit.
I'll let you know when I know more.
  Oh, sir, a     Not now.
  You brought him here?   I brought myself.
It's serious, Doug.
Ready.
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!
Go! Go! Go!
  Clear.   Clear.
Clear.
  It's empty.   All clear.
  It's empty, sir.   Confirmed. All clear.
   Francis, did they find     No.
I thought Ahmadi was going to...
No, we are where we are.
We knew it was a risk.
  You okay?   Yes, I'm fine.
Let's get you upstairs.
...by Tom Hammerschmidt,  minutes ago.
In the article, it says the President was asked to comment,
but declined.
Among those quoted are ex-President Garrett Walker,
Congresswoman Jackie  
How many phone calls have you got so far?
Uh, at least .
  You?   Ah, I stopped counting.
Where should we go?
Surprise me.
No, we don't say anything.
We'll let him burn in the lights for a few days
and see how this plays out.
And then we blanket every swing state with ads.
Thirty seconds, in silence. Just the headline.
Let that sink into people's gray matter.
Okay. We'll talk soon.
Come here. I wanna show you something.
I'm still upset.
You can't pretend that nothing's happened.
I am not weak.
I shouldn't have said that. I know you're not.
And here's something else I know.
You're gonna be the next First Lady of the United States.
All right, stay in your office.
I'll call you back in a bit.
Some Prinivil and aspirin, please.
It's out?
Yes.
Doug's got Macallan with him, too.
They're expanding his program, but without him in charge.
So we're not safe there, either.
Well, if he was...
if he was there to manage it, but he's not, so...
No, we're not safe.
  Should I call Dr. Saxon?   No, it's not necessary.
  Thank you very much. That'll be all.   Yes, sir.
Three weeks...
then the election.
It's nothing.
And then we lose.
And they investigate.
And everything we...
Gone.
I feel...
numb.
I do, too.
We make time.
We can't fight everything off one by one, Francis.
But if we make this...
we make it work for us.
Create chaos.
More than chaos.
War.
Fear.
Fear.
Brutal.
Total.
I'm done trying to win over people's hearts.
Let's attack their hearts.
We can work with fear.
Yes, we can.
You should put on a fresh suit.
The navy blue.
Yes, the navy blue.
  Where's Macallan?   We sent him home.
All right, tell him to stay put. We'll tackle that later.
Have Seth inform the networks. The Oval, one hour.
  Do you need him to draft something?   Tom will write it.
  He's not here.   Then get him here.
What about the last part that you crossed out?
Uh, "To mourn is not to fear. To grieve is not to admit defeat."
You should keep that in.
But it presumes he's going to die.
He is going to die.
We talk to the lawyers first, then you can talk to the press.
I've got major funders pulling out already.
The President should put in calls to set them at ease.
No. No calls. The campaign's on hold.
We lose that money, so be it.
We need to stabilize.
I don't think he should say the part about mourning and grief.
I agree, but Yates said they wanted it back in.
Is it true?
What Hammerschmidt wrote?
  Is it?   No.
That's the first time you've lied to me...
since you stopped lying to me.
My fellow Americans, over the past two years,
certainly within the last several days and hours,
I have asked myself, "What does it mean to be President?
What does true leadership look like?"
It's a question many of you have asked yourselves
as November approaches.
Right now, as I sit in this chair, in this office,
where so many of my predecessors
have steered our nation through turbulent times...
I realize that this job
is one that transcends politics and rhetoric.
Entrusted to anyone who sits behind this desk
is something far more elemental, the very survival of our nation.
And I, as your President, must confront the storm before us.
That storm is terror.
More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane.
It has endangered us abroad.
It has endangered us at home.
And right now, it has placed James Miller
in the gravest of dangers.
We attempted to communicate with his captors.
We hoped for a peaceful solution.
We're relieved that
Caroline and Melissa Miller are safe and sound.
But terror is blind to reason.
Given the opportunity to renounce terror,
Yusuf Al Ahmadi chose to encourage it.
So, unfortunately,
we must now move beyond reason.
We must respond with force.
Because there is no scenario in which we will release him.
He will remain in United States custody until his dying breath.
If the captors call again, we will not answer.
The time for conversation is over, no matter the consequences.
Regardless of whether James Miller is released or not,
rescued or not,
killed or not...
ICO will be destroyed.
We are at war.
It will be a war more total than anything we have waged thus far
in the fight against extremism.
Soldiers will die.
Civilians may die.
There will be pain. There will be suffering.
We will be confronted with the most horrific aspects of humanity.
We will confront the inhuman.
Evil itself.
But we will triumph.
It is not a war we will lose.
And if the worst happens to James Miller...
we must remember,
To mourn is not to fear.
To grieve is not to admit defeat.
God bless America,
and all of those who believe in freedom and democracy.
  Any news?  They just posted on Twitter.
We won't find them before that.
Do we have the capability to block the video?
Well, we might be able to block some sites,
  but if they have enough mirrors     Don't block anything.
Yes, sir.
The whole world should watch this.
And we should, too.
  What you said, "We're at war..."   I want to build a coalition.
  More air strikes?   Ground, air...
The full force of our military.
Well, I wish you would have consulted first.
This type of escalation  
Not escalation, Cathy. Obliteration.
This is your response to the article?
We're doing what's necessary.
When you find them... you will kill them.
If we're able to apprehend alive, we may get  
I understand, Mr. President.
Sir?
I wanna be  . I can give you that.
But it's gonna be a lot harder if I...
If you want me here by your side, I will be.
  But I'd prefer     No.
You do what you have to do. Be back when it's over.
I will. Thank you, sir.
Do you want to come inside?
  The kids there?   Yeah.
  You're not letting them watch...   No.
No, I forbade them to.
Although, I mean, with school and... and their friends,
it'll be impossible to prevent if...
if they really wanna see it.
They all right?
Are you all right?
I will be.
I have to be.
All these people in their houses...
about to see this awful thing...
that they'll never be able to erase.
Were you there, when your husband died?
In the room?
No.
Have you ever watched someone die?
I know you gotta go back there tonight...
but when you're done...
whenever that is...
you're staying here.
We do this in the name of the Islamic Caliphate,
in the name of Yusuf Al Ahmadi, in the name of God.
Melissa, I love you. Caroline, I love you.
Please, dear God, look out  
Turn off the sound.
That's right.
We don't submit to terror.
We make the terror.House.of.Cards.SE
I've been meaning to talk with you.
It's terrifying, isn't it?
The president and I have a simple request.
Tell us what you see.
If anything in your environment
strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off,
pick up the phone.
Whether it's a package or a person that seems out of place,
we'd love you to let us know.
Because there's a lot of noise out there these days.
A noisy press that's choosing to dwell on the past
instead of what's happening right now.
My husband and I want to protect you.
In two weeks' time, you will be heading to the ballot box
to decide what kind of country you want to live in.
It's a profound choice.
But no matter who wins this election,
we're going to need to work together,
watch out for each other,
and, yes, watch each other,
to keep us all safe and sound.
Tell us what you see.
My name is Claire Underwood, and I approve this message.
Should we do one more?
Did the Democrats show?
They didn't disappoint. Almost every member, sir.
  Almost.   I have a list of those who did.
My fellow congressmen, I do not need the Washington Herald
to tell me that a scoundrel lives in the White House.
I can see the Democrats are here.
They're eager to debate.
I say to the gentlemen on the other side of the aisle...
thank you.
Should we investigate the president
for crimes committed while he was vice president?
I say, yes. Let's debate.
Let's debate this miscreant all day and all night.
Madam Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry.
The gentleman from Georgia
may state the nature of his parliamentary inquiry.
Do the rules of the House not require
the president be formally invited in order to attend?
Madam Speaker, if I may...
The Speaker recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.
The president is wearing his congressional pin today
and is thereby welcome to any and all proceedings.
Madam Speaker! Madam Speaker!
Rules of the House state
that former members are not allowed on the floor
when they have interest in the matter under debate.
Madam Speaker,
the president has no interest
or opinion on the matter being debated today.
The House suspend. The House will suspend.
Madam Speaker, I still do have the floor,
and I find it hard to believe
the president wouldn't have an opinion on the matter being discussed.
If the good gentleman from Florida
would yield a portion of his time,
I assure him it will satisfy his query.
I yield three minutes to the leader.
And I yield my time to the former congressman from South Carolina
and the President of the United States.
Point of order! Parliamentary inquiry!
Parliamentary inquiry!
Parliamentary inquiry!
Mr. President. This is beyond the norm.
I don't care.
I don't care.
And I also do not care about your investigative committees.
No, that is not what I care about today.
The House will cease.
That is not what I care about today.
I am on my way to the funeral of an American patriot.
A good man, a husband...
a father...
who was beheaded on American soil.
And this chamber chooses to debate me?
  The House will suspend.   I asked to speak
to a full session of this chamber and my requests were denied.
  Madam Speaker!   Mr. President, you must yield the floor.
I will not yield, Madam Speaker.
Because I cannot wait.
One of the murderers...
One of the murderers who killed Mr. Jim Miller...
is still out there.
At large.
How much more proof do you people need?
I demand that every member of this House take a stand.
Like FDR before, and Wilson before him.
I demand that this Congress
declare a formal declaration of war against ICO,
both here and abroad.
Motion to adjourn.
  Second!   The House will adjourn.
  The president will cease.   I will not cease!
I will never cease.
I demand that this Congress declare a state of war
has existed and does exist
between ICO and the United States of America.
And I demand that every member of this House stay in this chamber
for as long as it takes, until you bring my request to a vote.
Or you will all go down in history as cowards!
Cowards!
The sergeant at arms will remove the president.
Madam Speaker, I repeat. I demand a vote.
I will not yield.
I will not yield.
I will not yield.
Alleged terrorist Zachary Hawthorne was killed by the FBI,
but Joshua Masterson is still at large.
While the Miller family mourns,
the hunt for the missing terrorist continues
and tensions are running high.
The president may be asking for war,
but it seems war's already been declared on him.
My fans.
FBI is looking into a multiple shooting in Chattanooga.
  Reports have it gang related.   No.
A private plane went down in West Virginia. Mechanical failure.
A series of homes were set on fire in Georgia,
most likely arson.
Convenience store in North Carolina
in the morning.
  Where's the store?   Uh, suburb outside of Raleigh.
The cause is still under investigation.
  I'll make an appearance.   Yes, ma'am.
Just put it on the schedule so the media has time to mobilize.
Yes, ma'am.
I take it the president has declared war on Joshua Masterson.
He never should've kicked me off that call.
But this morning isn't about politics.
That's right.
We need to show some compassion for the living.
And respect for the dead.
The family's agreed to a moment.
No press, no speeches, but we should be able to pull something.
  Mr. President.   Governor.
Do they not realize what we've done for them already?
I pointed that out, sir, but...
the daughter's medicated and very fragile at the moment.
All right.
Mrs. Miller.
  I'm so very sorry.   Thank you.
And I promise you,
I will not stop
until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy
is brought to justice.
And I swear to you, as God is my witness...
no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.
The nation mourns with you and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.
  Thank you. If you don't mind...   Of course.
Mr. President.
I'll be right along.
It's a busy day for you today, sir.
It's a sad, sad day.
It's a shame things didn't turn out differently.
Yes. Well, some things are bigger than the two of us, Will.
I don't want him here!
Calm down, Melissa. Please.
It's his fault. He's dead.
  Daddy's dead. He killed him.   Please.
Give me a minute.
  Did you take your medicine?   Yes. Okay?
Yes. Yes!
You do. You think about what you would say on a day like today.
If a day like today were to happen.
But you let it pass...
because you know you have so much more left ahead of you.
So much to do together.
You think... You think  minutes...
If we were late  minutes...
Or two, or one...
Or if we went somewhere else to eat...
But to dwell in the past, to live in what-ifs...
That wasn't my husband.
That wasn't us...
  Honey...   Please.
Okay. Come on.
I need to...
I wanted to say about my father...
He was so strong... so brave.
My father was taking us to...
My father...
  Come on, baby. It's okay.   My father...
You killed my father. You're the reason he died.
Melissa...
It's all right, Melissa. We understand.
I hope you die and she becomes president.
What did the girl say to you?
She said she hopes I die and that you become the president.
Mr. Macallan, this is Deputy Director Michaels from the NSA.
I'm literally in your office. I believe we had a meeting.
There's been raids as far up as New York and down to the panhandle.
As of now,
Green's focusing in on the
border between Virginia and North Carolina.
Seth has a statement ready for this afternoon.
No. The best statement is no statement.
Besides, I want Claire to be the voice on this
until we're ready.
Yes, sir.
  Quite a crowd out there.   Well, we better bring Birch in first.
Yes, sir.
Congressman Birch.
Bob.
Well, that was a little bit of history this morning, wasn't it?
  It certainly was.   I couldn't see it any other way.
No disagreement from here.
Well, you know how the Republicans are.
Anything but a decision.
They mistake complaint for leadership.
Well, instead of a committee to investigate you,
you got one to discuss your declaration.
All the way to election day.
Even if there's only a handful
of Republicans with the grit and spit to put up a fight,
we can control the conversation.
Get them talking about anything but that goddamn article.
All right. Now, who from our side
  do we need to massage?   Womack.
The declaration caught him off guard. Had to keep him out of it.
It's his constituents that actually fight the damn thing.
Well, let's call in the honorable gentleman from Missouri.
  Oh, he's a bourbon man, isn't he?   Yes, he is.
A stunt. Yes, I'm calling it a stunt.
Charlie, if I may...
Tom, please, what are you implying?
This request for a declaration of war is yet another distraction.
And I've never been prouder of the president than I am today.
I'm not denying what happened to the Millers. It was a tragedy.
No, but you are. Because denying it is the tragedy.
This is a pattern.
Your husband's administration, Mrs. Underwood,
  continues to operate in the shadows.   Tom...
I understand you believe in the importance of your article.
And I agreed to come here today and talk with you about it.
But we're fighting to keep this country safe.
Mrs. Underwood,
the White House has yet to release one piece of information
about the attempted capture of those domestic terrorists.
ICO terrorists, yes.
Reports from a few hours ago
are saying North Carolina or Virginia.
But that's all we have.
Well, we are circling in, we're getting closer.
I will tell you,
our intelligence community, they are the real heroes.
Charlie, if we could get back to my point, my sources confirmed  
Tom.
Heather Dunbar, no friend of mine or my husband's,
looked into these charges, and cleared the president.
Cleared? Please.
The White House has not had a single press briefing
since the Herald ran my article.
You keep saying the White House isn't speaking about this.
I am sitting right here talking to you.
Not Remy Danton or Jackie Sharp.
Or Lucas Goodwin, either.
  What?   Excuse me. Lucas Goodwin, meaning?
I'm saying, me. I'm here.
And I don't know how many more times we have to go over this.
You know, a Tom Hammerschmidt article used to be
the first thing I would look for
when I opened the Washington Herald.
The Underwoods are no longer campaigning.
They can call it what they want.
Well, if you think about the last few days, what's in the air...
It might not be such a bad idea for us to
take it one handshake at a time.
Or call it for what it is.
"Home and abroad."
The president is essentially asking for permission
to fight a war on our soil.
We can't push back too hard.
We can't afford to look soft on terror.
We can't look the other way, either.
You of all people know where this kind of talk leads.
...ICO and the United States of America.
Make sure the committee dealing with the declaration of war
never gets to a vote.
We're not against war, we're against his.
And I want you to reach out to the Speaker
and find out who she's putting on that committee.
We need to get back to the president's crimes.
That's the story. It's the only story.
Anything else?
I have my script.
I will not yield!
I will not...
Harry...
I want to know what he says and when he says it.
Our general isn't used to taking orders.
Will, one more thing.
  What?   Your wife.
Okay, I know we opened up this campaign on Pollyhop,
but it might be time to close it down...
or at least be more careful.
Well, what did they find out?
The home of the mother of the terrorist,
you know, the one they're looking for,
was vandalized last night.
Garage set on fire. Broken windows.
And, uh, Hannah...
well... she posted.
She was defending the mother online.
  When?   This afternoon.
The timing is not good on this.
  I can show you.   Not now.
Thank you.
Governor Conway and I are honored to be here
with the Miller family and their closest friends.
I know the VFW
was a big part of Jim's life here in Knoxville.
With the help of Homeland and our hotline,
we think that Masterson
has crossed into the southwest corner of Virginia.
Scott or Washington.
  And?   And...
Assistant Director Green?
We're relying on aerial support,
sightings and local law enforcement.
But we're fairly confident
we can have him pinned down in the next  hours.
The president wants us to be absolutely sure.
We can't have him getting away again. Careers are at stake.
Everyone around this table
is fully aware of the gravity of the situation.
Good. The president will be happy to hear that.
Okay. What kind of kiss do you want?
  Eskimo.   In...
and out.
I'll be right back.
  You're angry.   I am.
I was asked a question and I answered.
That's the least of it.
Okay, well, I don't want to talk about it right now.
Are you trying to lose this election? Are you?
Will, stop it.
This woman that you're defending...
Her son just cut someone's head off.
And he's still out there somewhere.
  Do you understand what this looks like?   Stop it.
Do you want to know why our son can't sleep?
He's eight years old, and he can't sleep.
Because he's having nightmares.
Because he thinks
there's a big black dog running around the hotel.
  Dog?   Yes.
He closes his eyes, and he can hear it growling.
He's scared, Will.
I said what I said because that woman is a victim.
We all are.
And it has to stop.
I want you to win.
Get yourself a drink. I'll be right back.
That's the mother. And this is Hannah's response.
She's not a criminal
and should not be punished for the sins of her son.
We all, I know, reject
the rhetoric and actions of these damaged, troubled young men.
What I mean is, this is a time for reflection,
not aggression...
So she's not condoning it, but it is sympathetic.
Plays into the idea that Joshua and Zachary
were just a pair of troubled kids looking for a cause,
no different than some school shooter.
The post has been shared over , times.
I want to talk with her.
  Hannah?   The mother.
We've been very careful about where you appear.
  LeAnn, will you excuse us for a moment?   Of course.
We need to dial up the terror.
And the mother can help us with that.
But that also means we have to locate Masterson.
Soon.
Tom is waiting for me.
Well, you go on.
Francis...
I shouldn't have cried at the funeral.
  No, it played beautifully.   Not for me.
Come with me.
Come on. Just tell him you'll be late.
  Mr. President.   It's all right, Officer.
Ma'am.
May I have your scope?
Scope on your gun. I promise I'll give it back.
Thank you. Come here.
Now, if you just hold the scope a little a ways from your face...
and look down, straight down, across the lawn...
right to the gate.
You see them?
Those people want a voice. Some for, some against.
And they're looking back across the lawn,
toward this house and these windows...
and they're thinking,
"I wonder what the president
and the First Lady are doing tonight.
And will they be able to protect us?"
I should have been there.
Where?
When you got shot. I wish I was there.
Maybe I could've...
protected you.
You see, all those people want...
is someone to keep them from what they're afraid to know.
And what are the president and First Lady doing tonight, Francis?
Well, I believe Thomas is waiting for you.
Thank you, sir.
I'll see you in the morning.
Do you have a smoke?
Thank you.
 I know what my people are thinking tonight 
 As home through the shadows they wander 
 Everyone smiling in secret delight 
 As they stare at the castle and ponder 
 And whenever the wind blows this way 
 You can almost hear everyone say 
 I wonder what the king is doing tonight 
I've been looking for you.
I got hungry.
So I went down to the main kitchen.
That's a lovely group of people you have down there.
If there's anything you need, it can be brought up.
I didn't know what I needed until I was eating it.
I heard the president's declaration.
Very compelling.
What did you really think?
It was almost like the real thing.
The NSA has good people. Very good.
  Too good.   Not as good as you.
Good enough to find my algorithms.
That doesn't mean they knew what we were using them for.
No, no.
One second, they send me home, and then the next,
they tell me, "Come back!"
They'll been watching me. This is a trap.
Or the only way out.
God damn it.
  You want out?   Don't you?
LeAnn...
we have done some illegal things here.
There are other campaigns.
  If you can get into the NSA...   That's not possible.
...into their system, you can fix this.
  You're not listening to me.   I am.
I know the Underwoods.
The only way that we are gonna survive this...
is if they win.
You can help them win.
I know you can.
I got on the paper right around the time you left.
Did you start in Style?
Metro desk.
But then I did this piece, a street fashion,
kids on the street thing.
I'm surprised you asked for me.
Some people are being moved around and off the team.
The Masterson story. "War, what is it good for?"
Were you ever interested in investigative journalism?
If you ask me, if it's not investigating, it's not journalism.
Word around here is you can get anybody to talk to you.
, with a drink in their hands...
yeah.
She's the one they say you called a...
you know.
I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous.
You're sort of a legend and...
articles on the president?
It'd be an honor to work with you in any capacity.
To be part of this.
Did you find him? Did you?
It'll only be another moment.
Because I've done all I can.
Everything you told me to. You know that.
They know that, don't they?
Mrs. Underwood.
I was hoping to speak to Ms. Masterson.
Just the two of us.
Is there a problem?
It is a bit extreme.
Expanding the no-fly list to this extent.
The restrictions on visas alone is unprecedented.
How do we justify?
The White House counsel's been all through that.
It's there in black and white.
We're virtually closing down our borders
  without any hard evidence to back it up.   It's coming.
A lot of innocent people are trying to get into this country.
They could be hurt by this.
A change in policy this big, I want it done right.
I want you to let the world know
that if they want to continue coming to this country
for our hospitals, our colleges,
our golf courses and God knows what else...
they're going to have to deliver
more than my head on the end of a burning stick.
Now look, Cathy,
I know you have well-earned relationships out there.
Long-standing.
I'm not holding back, Francis. I have reached out.
Then I need you to reach further.
I want actionable intelligence.
I want to know where ICO is, or at the very least,
that everyone's out there looking.
Are we clear?
We're clear.
Thank you, Cathy. I know you won't let me down.
He's dead.
Is that why you're here?
We're still looking for him  
Because if he's dead, I want to see him. To touch him.
  I'm trying to help...   Ms. Masterson,
  ...but he hasn't contacted me.   please.
I wish he would.
I understand. Calm down.
He's not a monster like they all say.
I lost him somewhere. But he's not...
But still, monsters do exist, don't they?
I want my lawyer.
What for?
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.
I don't know why I say anything anymore.
I wanted to see you...
to ask you a simple question.
Didn't you know what was going on in your home?
  Excuse me?   You knew...
even before he went to Pakistan.
  I mean, you raised him.   No.
No. He had some problems. He got lost.
But no, nothing like this.
But you saw what he did, didn't you?
  No.   Would you like to see it?
We can show it to you, if you like.
No. Please don't.
What he did to that family, to that man...
What sort of person would do such a thing?
He's my son.
Oh, God.
I know. It's awful, isn't it?
Thank you.
When you leave today,
there will be some reporters, some cameramen out there.
But you don't need to say very much.
You just need to ask Josh to turn himself in.
There are so many hardworking mothers and fathers out there.
This could've happened to any of them.
We are close to capturing your son, Ms. Masterson,
and I will do my best to have you see him.
I want to go.
No one's keeping you.
But who did she put in?
Who did the Speaker put on the committee?
Mostly lifers, with secure seats.
We're two weeks out. It's hard to say no to war.
You and I have some things in common.
  We both dislike the president.   No. I'm still a Democrat.
Who leans to the right.
Alex, you do actually lean a little to the right.
Look, he's the commander in chief.
He's got all the authority he needs to fight them where they are.
Well, there's one here. Out there, right now, as we speak.
Well, I'm a big fan of American law enforcement.
They'll find him soon enough.
We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation
that's always looking over their shoulder.
If you can get yourself onto that committee,
I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.
My driver will take you back to your car. But, Congressman...
this is your chance.
And I think you know it.
Thank you so much for coming out here.
Thank you so much for coming out.
Great to see you. Thanks for coming out.
Just go away!
You have no idea what is happening in your own homes.
Have you any idea where he is, Mrs. Masterson?
Josh, please...
please, please turn yourself in.
This has all got to stop. No, no.
...this after ten years with Treasury, he was waiting for it.
Yeah...
Mrs. Underwood!
Mrs. Underwood!
Mrs. Underwood!
Does the administration believe that the explosion was connected
  with Joshua Masterson somehow?   We're not sure yet.
Uh, there is strong evidence to suggest.
The owner of the establishment was foreign-born.
Any connection to ICO overseas?
I think our Deputy Director
Clark here is better equipped to answer that.
We're looking into it. In the meantime, we've set up a hotline.
If anyone in the community
  has any     And if the Republican candidate
and the rest of his party refuse to acknowledge
the seriousness of the threat made here at home...
know that we will.
The FBI is currently gathering a list of words and images.
If they appear on your children's
or your coworkers' devices, please  
War whore!
  Move!   Car!
It was just paint. She's all right.
And what else? Spit it out, Doug. It won't taste so bad.
Sir, I know you disagree with me on this.
But Director Green and his team
have a location for the takedown and they're ready to act.
And they're positive it's the right location?
  Adamant.   When?
Hours.
We can coordinate out of the Situation Room.
Oh, no. I'm gonna meet him in person.
Sir, I strongly advise against that.
Duly noted, but I'll be on-site.
Yes, sir.
It's amazing how ready people are to be afraid.
History would prove them right.
You're lucky this is coming off with water.
Could've been worse.
Some found its way behind your ear.
  Should I be afraid?   Don't be smart.
I should, shouldn't I?
I stole something from you.
What?
What it is, doesn't matter.
I just wanted something that was yours.
Well, put it back.
Waterfalls.
The NSA marked their zero-day exploits as waterfalls.
What can they get us into?
We can backdoor into some very popular social media.
I can insert anything your imagination can think of
into those sites.
Underwoods or otherwise.
...reports coming in from a variety of sources
stating that local police enforcement and FBI agents
are currently on the ground.
We're receiving reports that
there's a great deal of police activity on the Virginia border.
We cannot confirm at this time,
but we believe this is connected to the manhunt
for domestic terrorist Joshua Masterson.
The capture of Joshua Masterson may be close at hand.
The FBI is still not commenting,
but if you look at this aerial view,
you can see heavily-armed men
making their way through this wooded area.
Sir, he's not here.
All we have are some loose domestic connections.
A perverse idolization of ICO overseas.
He refuses to confirm any wide-ranging homegrown network.
Our interrogators are confident the asset is no longer valuable.
And risk to reward no longer tenable.
Sir, we have reached a breaking point.
Did you think I didn't already have him?
That I would have left him out there somewhere?
And I thought you knew me.
Josh.
Joshua.
Do you want to live?
Tell us what we want.
Tell us what we want to hear.
You're no martyr, are you?
Look at you.
No, you're not a martyr.
No one will remember what you've done,
either here on Earth or in your heaven.
So why did you pick the Millers?
Why?
What did you see?
Was it the girl?
Did you see her first?
What did you see?
Or did she see you first?
Yeah, that's it, isn't it? She saw you.
She looked right through you, didn't she?
I don't need to see this person anymore.
  Get rid of the asset.   Sir.
He's an animal, but he's still an American citizen.
We are at war. And he is an enemy combatant.
And he lost whatever rights he might have had as an American
when he cut that poor man's head off.
So don't give me your pride or your position.
Because none of this would have happened
if you'd done what you were told in the first place.
I'll take care of it.
Yes, you will, and you will do so willingly.
And I want you to get some good, usable footage...
of his killing.
And then destroy everything else.
We will be releasing footage of Joshua Masterson's killing.
The administration and the intelligence community
were hoping to take him alive.
But I would like to commend
Assistant Director of Counterterrorism, Nathan Green.
And of course all of the work
that Secretary Durant has done behind the scenes on all of this.
The information the investigation has gathered so far
points to Joshua Masterson and Zachary Hawthorne
having strong connections to ICO abroad
and ICO's growing network domestically.
And so I would like to say this to ICO directly.
You will not infect the mind of one more of our young people,
because I will not stop until I find you.
And I say that for the grieving Miller family,
whom I hope will find some sleep tonight.
I also urge Congress
to accelerate the process
and vote on my request for a declaration of war.
  Mr. President?   I will not be answering questions.
Seth will take it from here.
It's hard to see, but I think that was the killshot.
Now, please remember, these reports are unconfirmed
and we're waiting on a statement from the White House.
What we can report is a great deal...
Why are you watching this?
...this wooded area. And shots being fired, both by and  
Hello?
Hello. This is Francis Underwood.
It's him.
The committee is looking for Remy Danton and Jackie Sharp.
What do either of them have to do with ICO or the war?
The talk up on the Hill is they're going to invite you
and the rest of your staff to testify.
They're gonna use the Declaration of War to investigate.
That's right.
They're gonna use the committee Frank asked for to investigate him.
  Fuck.   That's right, Doug.
"Fuck."
It's difficult to underst  
Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.
Please stop it.
I thought this news would bring you some relief.
The president called Mrs. Miller.
I promised you and your daughter that I would  
Leave her alone.
Well, perhaps we should speak
when you're feeling a little more up to it.
I don't want to hear you. Or from you.
  What you did to my family...   What?
Leave us out of it. And do not use my husband's name.
Listen, Mrs.  
She hung up.
Let's go for a walk.
Mr. President!
Tell them what they need to know.
Mr. President!
Hello.
Mr. President. Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You have nothing to be afraid of.House.of.Cards.SE
Why do you keep playing with that?
Because I'm skeptical.
Do you think this really works?
Oh, it's just about making the candidate seem familiar,
so that the voter sees herself in him.
But... you've gone too far.
There.
Congratulations, Francis. You have my vote.
  When do you leave for New York?   Now.
Then I'm back for the event with Cathy.
It's very risky, what Macallan is doing.
Do you think it's worth it?
  Danton and Sharp just lawyered up.   They don't want to testify?
And there's no way subpoenas get them
in front of the committee before the election.
There's a rumor the committee's
trying to make a deal with Garrett Walker.
No, Walker doesn't want to do damage to the party.
So why did Jim Matthews agree to appear?
I'm already getting pummeled with questions about it.
Does he have anything to say?
Uh, even if he pleads the Fifth,
they get a perp walk that implicates the president.
I didn't know anyone actually ate those.
I look forward to this stuff all year.
Do we have anything on the committee members?
Nothing too juicy yet, I'm afraid.
Vice chairman had an affair with a young male staffer
before he came out to his wife. Old news.
Committee chairman's squeaky clean
other than a minor back-tax issue.
I did find some revenge porn on the chairman's chief of staff,
but I don't think it's worth much.
Is it enough to scare her?
Embarrass her, probably. More than that, probably not.
I gotta say, they look a lot better on you, Mrs. Underwood,
than they would on Governor Conway.
Maybe that's why he didn't wanna pay for it.
These masks will be distributed to all MTA engineers,
conductors and maintenance workers.
And this model is highly effective in case of a chemical attack.
And I believe Mayor Adalardi would like to say a few words.
Absolutely.
Safety in all branches of the public transportation system
  is my number one priority.   Ken?
  That means subways, that means buses...   It's fine, I know him.
What are you doing here?
What? This is my stop.
  Well, you look well.   Well, I can't complain.
Can't complain, except...
Well, I'm sure you heard about Tim.
Corbet? No.
  Beth didn't call?   No.
Oh, man. I hate to be the one to tell you this.
Tim went out on the Arkansas River.
He's been missing for two days now.
I thought for sure the President would have heard.
I mean, I can't imagine how Frank's gonna take this.
Oh, my goodness! Beth and the kids must be so distraught.
Sure. But Frank and Tim's relationship was special.
It's great to see you, Claire.
Would you ask Frank to give me a call?
  Mrs. Underwood?   Uh, just one moment.
See that gentleman I was speaking to?
Go ask him to wait for me, please.
Governors, we are running out of time.
The fact that you are here
at this emergency meeting on such short notice
tells the American people that
you are as concerned about their safety as I am.
Terror is unacceptable.
I do not accept it.
But we will not be deterred
by Washington's failure to address it.
We will work together, side by side, fighting back.
State by state, city by city, neighborhood by neighborhood.
Because, make no mistake...
we are engaged in the battle of our time.
The question of what it is to be an American,
the very essence of American-ness,
how we choose to lead our lives, open and free,
is on the line.
Fear is un-American.
And yes, the irony of saying those words to you
on Halloween, of all days, is not lost on me.
But although we may choose, as Americans,
to scare ourselves once a year for fun...
no one else tells any American
when to shake in their boots at any other time.
So I am issuing an executive order,
by virtue of the authority vested in me
as President of the United States
and commander in chief of the armed forces.
By our Constitution and the laws of our land,
including Section Blah-Blah of the Blah-Blah Act
and Section Blah-Blah of Title Blah-Blah,
Paragraph Bullshit-Bullshit.
In case you have no idea what's going on,
I'm swelling these states' National Guard troops
to create secure public spaces on Election Day.
I'm urging these governors to consolidate their polling sites
and create quote, unquote "voting centers"
so that people feel safe to come out and vote.
I'm commending Governor Sally Morrison
of the great state of Arizona,
for giving us all such a good example of voting centers
as used in their recent primary.
But what I'm really doing
is seducing the governors of five key states.
New Jersey, Nevada, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Messrs. Harcourt, Nuez, Gallinard,
Olmstead and Matthews.
You remember Matthews, don't you?
Former vice president to President Garrett Walker.
Nothing but a provincial and petty pen-stealer.
But I need him.
I need all five on my side if I'm gonna win this election.
Matthews, in our history, he's the biggest known unknown.
And I almost forgot. The boy wonder is here.
My worthy opponent.
Out of his element and stuck in mine.
But, you see, in politics, stature is everything.
And wouldn't you say that
Willy C is getting shorter by the minute?
These border restrictions the president is proposing...
should the military play a role in enforcing them, General?
I think we need to take a step back
and look at our national security priorities.
And what constitutes appropriate deployment
of our serving men and women.
As veterans,
this issue is a personal one for Governor Conway and me.
  Would you and     I'll tell you something else.
You won't hear this from the governor himself,
but his military career
is distinguished by exceptional acts of bravery.
In particular, the incident for which
he was awarded the Purple Heart stands out.
Speaks to the kind of commander in chief he will be.
Demonstrates what I call fearless wisdom.
Someday soon, America needs to hear the full story of that day.
Thank you for your time, General Brockhart.
Glad to talk to you.
Coming up next on Special Report, we take a look at...
I swear to God, if Underwood puts soldiers on those borders,
I'll be the first to tell them not to listen.
In terms of allocation of funds,
it's our water supply that keeps me up at night.
Roger, are you talking about protecting the infrastructure?
Infrastructure and water sources.
Reservoirs, the dams, the tunnel delivery systems  
All of it, yes.
Protection from terrorism, sure,
but the voters see even greater dangers.
Structural, environmental, toxins from algae.
Algae's quite a problem for us.
The big question here, are the feds doing all they can do?
Well, the feds want to do even more.
That's the reason that we're all meeting here today.
Now, look, gentlemen, all I can see
is that we're in violent agreement with each other.
I mean, Roger, how long have we known each other?
How far do we go back?
You knew me when I had hair, Mr. President.
It doesn't change the fact that my constituents are saying,
"Give me a bridge, not a war zone."
All I'm saying is that
we need to anticipate threats when we can and thwart them.
I'm saying that we're days away from an election,
and I don't wanna upset the apple cart.
Excuse me for just a moment.
Will, have you seen this?
All right. I'll deal with him later.
Tell me exactly what she said.
Just that she heard it from Ken Caswell.
I checked with the local authorities in Salida, sir.
It doesn't look good.
  The chances of     Amp up the search.
Whatever materials and personnel they need
in addition to what they have, give them.
And reach out to Beth Corbet. I'd like to speak to her directly.
Yes, sir.
I haven't slept a good night's sleep since .
But I guess elected officials don't sleep
so our constituents can.
The proof of success in fighting terror...
is something the public never hears about.
A certain city in my state
wears the biggest target in the nation.
The city and state of New York...
has scored silent wins for  years...
without a declaration of war.
Now...
in most cases...
I would argue the states can take care of themselves.
Mr. President!
Well, by all means, continue, Governor.
What... what was that part you were talking about? Insomnia?
My point is,
we're all Americans in this room, and we all love this country.
and I'd like to thank the president
for the opportunity to discuss this very important topic,
and apologize for, uh, being on such a tight schedule.
Well, we are enormously grateful
that the governor took the time to come and join us today.
I'm just trying to understand.
Claire, if I said anything to offend you,
it was entirely...
I mean, you know me. No filter.
And that's what worries me.
I'm just operating on instinct, Ken.
Did you come down here with an agenda?
No. I mean...
I have been trying to reach Frank, but today was just...
I saw that you were appearing at an event
and I showed up to say hi.
I... I really do work around here,
on a street called "Wall", you know?
But then you made reference
to something about two very close friends
that's nobody's business, including yours.
And you even said so yourself,
Ken, that you have an awfully big mouth.
I...
I lost a dear friend.
I loved Tim. Everybody did.
And you implied Francis especially.
Well, yeah. I mean... That was a whole other thing.
In what way?
In... What do you want me to say?
I'm sure I don't know anything you don't.
I'm just very interested in your perspective.
Frank worshipped Tim, would have done anything for him.
I don't know.
If the world were a different place back then... who knows?
That was a long time ago. And then he met you.
And lucky him.
Look, in terms of my firm and...
and trying to get the president's ear...
I mean, yeah, it's a little embarrassing
that my friend of  whatever years
didn't have time to pick up the phone.
He should have called you back.
Francis and Tim were very good friends.
But, you know, Ken, the older I get,
I learn that assumptions are dangerous.
Sure. Okay.
It was great to see you.
So where is she?
Change of plans. She needed to stay in New York.
She asked me to put something together for this.
Yeah? Well, something came up.
The vice president will be filling in for her.
Oh, my...
Hey, man.
Uh, we played in a terrible band together back in the day.
Before adulthood and alimony came crashing down.
Two exes?
So, uh, where's the First Lady?
Something came up.
I'd love to ask you a few questions about working on the campaign.
I'm just a speechwriter.
Exactly. How the hell did that happen?
Welcome to the Council on Foreign Relations
The Way Forward.
I smell a swing state party.
Tone, Rick.
You didn't have to round up dozens of governors
just to talk to the five of us.
You're here because there have been concerning threats
in exurban counties in each of your states.
Could you be more specific?
We're keeping an eye on Hunterdon, Elko, Jefferson counties.
Also Chester and McHenry.
Which is why it's crucial
that we work with your states' administrations
leading up to the election.
Every one of those precincts
is a typically Republican stronghold.
This isn't about party affiliation.
As the president said, this is about security.
Now, we believe this course of action,
the voting centers with the added law enforcement,
will give us everything that we need
to protect the integrity of the ballot box.
Okay, but speaking for
Governor Olmstead and maybe all of our bosses,
how can we be sure that these measures
won't discourage everyone from getting to the polls?
  I.E., Democrats.   It's a chance we have to take.
But we don't believe it'll play out that way.
We're in an extremely close race in Ohio.
Preventing further acts of terrorism
is just about all that matters, Tanya.
Now, I do realize with these heightened threats
comes an additional strain on the governors of your states.
So...
I say to each and every one of you...
tell me how we can help.
Putting aside the very real moral questions,
how is shutting down the borders even feasible?
I know this policy is going to hurt some people,
but let me explain why it's necessary.
And the vice president should feel free to jump in.
But is it fun?
Putting words in the Underwoods' mouths?
That's not what I do.
It's more like the opposite.
I just try and articulate...
what's on their minds and in their hearts.
That's how you see your job?
Basically, my job is to remain invisible.
Were you with them that night?
The night Jim Miller was killed?
I'm not gonna answer that.
I'll take that as a "yes."
Don't.
I'm just trying to understand what you do.
Then you're missing the point.
I'm not the story, Steve. I'm just not.
You make yourself sound replaceable.
I am.
  I serve at the pleasure of the president.   And the First Lady?
The Democratic vice presidential candidate...
Yeah. Her, too.
But you write speeches for both of them?
Most often for Mrs. Underwood.
Articulating what's on her mind and in her heart?
I'm just a mouthpiece.
Has she put you in charge of any other parts?
You're still an asshole, man.
Good luck with the alimony.
  That was rough.   It went fine.
It's not sustainable.
I mean, what do you think?
  About what?   About the president's rush to war.
At least half the Beltway seems to think it's outrageous.
It is outrageous.
We could resign our posts, you know, in protest.
I bet we can convince others of the cabinet to do the same thing.
Outrageous by design, I was going to say.
It's smart, what the president's doing.
  It's serving him in the polls.   Donald.
Let's... take a step back for a moment.
I underestimated you. I did.
When you were acting president, my faith was less than full.
But now, I understand the terrible box you were in, the forces  
Cathy, I'm gonna... I'm gonna stop you.
I honestly don't know what you're talking about.
Are you telling me your plan
is just to phone it in until January th?
Come on, Donald. What's happened to you?
Back in the day,
you and Marjorie were at
the forefront of every progressive cause,
literally fighting the good fight.
These people...
Can we really let them do this?
You wanna walk down memory lane, Cathy? Okay.
Remember the convention? Remember the Politico article?
I offered you an out.
You should've taken that opportunity to resign, then and there.
  Circumstances were nothing like this.   Sure they were.
You just didn't want to see it.
And, just so you know,
right before her mind was truly gone, Marjorie called it.
She saw the unholy alliance you were making with Frank Underwood.
She called it.
So this meeting between our bosses today...
The president is looking forward to
a productive discussion with Governor Matthews.
There's no one else here. Can we cut the crap?
You want us to engage in voter suppression.
It's not a phrase I'd ever use.
Fine. Call it "motor depression" for all I care.
We get it. White people are the problem.
Republicans. Understood.
But my boss doesn't happen to be up for reelection.
I'm listening.
I have two words for you. "Slag heap."
Matthews wants the EPA to name a slag heap
on the outskirts of Philadelphia as a Superfund site.
I seriously doubt that can happen before the election.
I think you should battle your doubts, Doug.
The governor is willing to let the past stay in the past.
But unless the Underwood administration
is bearing top-tier gifts,
you've got a lot of fucking nerve
asking for favors from the former VP.
On the other hand, if you make things right,
Matthews will do his part.
Don't you always feel sorry for the horse?
Who's in the conference room?
  You mean the lady brigade?   What?
That's what they call the NSA forensic auditors.
Yeah, I... I didn't know they were scheduled for today.
That's their routine. They just show up.
Welcome to the NSA.
Hey, boss.
May I, Mr. President?
Well, that's what they're there for.
I won't take up much of your time.
I know you have a busy afternoon.
  Well, I've got a little time.   I'm curious.
Why do you think the committee decided to call you first?
Because I asked them to.
Well, this emergency
governors' conference of yours came up and, uh...
I'm sure you recall, I don't much like DC,
so I figured why not make it one-stop shopping?
Yes.
But, of course, we both know that executive privilege
could've negated your having to appear at one of those shops.
Jim?
I'm going to help you with your slag heap.
I hope that means that I can count on you.
Of course that's what it means.
We're members of a tiny brotherhood, you and I, of ex-VPs.
When, and if, Garrett Walker appears before this committee,
do you think he'll...
  betray the party?   You mean you?
Well, that would be the same thing.
Now, I don't know what really happened
on your journey to replace me as vice president
and then Garrett as president.
I only know what my gut tells me.
But I'm willing to say fuck my gut.
Bottom line is
I can help you with this committee or I can hurt you.
Now, I can say that I know nothing...
and that what I saw in Garrett Walker was a troubled man.
And I can leave it at that.
What do you think?
Oh, I can't tell you what to do, Jim.
But I can say, as one ex-VP to another,
that this cleanup in Pennsylvania
is gonna be worth about   million and , jobs.
And that's not bad for an afternoon's work.
I like the new rug.
Oh, thank you. I didn't have much to do with it.
It was really Claire's design.
Good to see you, Mr. President.
You, too.
Governor Scanlon.
Mr. President.
You've been on my mind.
I wanna talk to your boss about the Declaration of War Committee.
So...
if you're hoping to intimidate him because of the back taxes,
you can save your breath.
His closet is back to being clean.
What about yours?
  You're a pig.   Hey, I didn't watch it.
I'm just the messenger.
  Be mad at the dude who posted it.   I am.
There are ways to get rid of it.
It's a goodwill gift. To let you know I'm serious.
Look, I'm guessing, sooner or later, I get called.
And if that happens, I could plead the Fifth.
I could press-secretary them all day long.
But I'd like to have another option on the table.
Yeah, I can't be a public witness myself...
but if you offer me anonymity and immunity...
I can testify privately.
Tell the committee where the bodies are buried, so to speak.
But, just to be clear, you're telling me
you have evidence the president engaged in criminal activity?
Not evidence regarding the president, no.
I have a lot of information about his chief of staff.
Doug Stamper.
Talk to your boss. Let me know.
Uh, Bridget, total non sequitur... You have a very elegant neck.
Mr. Grayson?
Sean Jeffries. I'm with the Herald.
Sorry, I don't have a free hand.
How long have you been with the paper?
Thirteen months. Style section.
Oh, that would explain why I don't know you.
Man's tie is a window into his soul.
We just ran a piece on it.
Oh, yeah? So, uh, what does my tie say about me?
It says you're a dedicated civil servant
with the bank account to prove it.
Anyway, recognized you, just wanted to say hi.
I mean, unless we can buy you a drink.
You know, uh, Cam Lawder?
Lobbyist for Mercedes-Benz?
Next to him is, uh, Kim Feldshuk, works at the DOD.
And that's Randy Beauford.
Personal trainer for fat Washington fucks.
We're going old school this afternoon.
Come on, join us for a quick one.
"Mouthpiece"?
I don't know why he was talking to the press in the first place.
An unfortunate choice of word for Tom, no doubt.
But still, it'll play itself out.
But what I want to know is, what do you see?
Why don't you like Yates?
Uh, Tom is an important part of the team.
His speeches have been  
Oh, look. He has more responsibilities than that.
You know it. So that bothers you.
I... just wouldn't want
anyone to infer a personal investment on his part
that isn't useful to the campaign.
I suppose all I'm saying is that
I won't let anything happen
to the First Lady or you, Mr. President.
I appreciate that, LeAnn.
We are fucked, Mr. President. Pardon my French.
I don't care about your French. Why am I even talking to you?
Well, the NSA has sent in auditors.
If I don't erase my files, cover my tracks  
We're a week away from the election, Mr. Macallan.
  Cover your tracks.   Okay. In which case,
I need to let hackers temporarily
invade a Capital East Telecom switching center.
Meaning what?
Well, the center covers most of the US government cyber traffic.
But if I'm in and out in  minutes,
I think the damage will look mischief-level.
Messed-up connections, that sort of thing.
 What if it takes you longer?  Uh, it won't,
because another ten,  minutes and...
Do it.
All right. Well, I'll start it at : p.m.
Uh, as soon as I'm done,
I'll anonymously send out a fix to the problem.
  No.   Sir?
LeAnn will contact you about when to send out the fix.
  You'll wait for her.   Okay, but just to be  
She'll let you know.
I just saw the Haines article.
I have no idea what Tom was thinking.
Yes.
It was sloppy.
Agreed. I'll talk to him.
Are you all right?
How was New York?
My events went well.
And? What aren't you telling me?
I bumped into Ken Caswell.
  Does he know any more?   No, um...
  Why didn't you call him back?   What?
His Treasury business. The oversight legislation.
I understand you don't care about it. Fine.
But you can't ignore loose ends like that. You owed him your ear.
Well, I didn't realize it was gonna become so personal.
I am the President of the United States,
for Christ's sake. I'm a bit busy.
The past doesn't disappear on command, Francis.
Not even for presidents.
What did he say to you?
Ken's got a big mouth.
I'm sorry about Tim. I'm sorry he's gone.
I know how you felt about him.
Or, I can imagine.
Listen to me.
You know you're the only person I've ever truly loved.
You know that, right?
And listen.
Something else is about to happen.
Welcome back.
Reception is sketchy. Good trip?
I just came back to get changed. I need to get back to Francis.
You mad at me?
You shouldn't have said that.
I know. I know we need to be careful.
Careful is far too small a word for what we need to be.
Okay.
But don't you get tired of
being far bigger than careful all the time?
  I don't know what's going on.   Me neither.
Seems to be some kind of network disturbance.
I lost connection on my server.
You know what I'm tired of? This role. First Lady.
'Cause it's never felt right.
It's only eight more days to the vice presidency.
  What's my role?   What?
What am I to you, anyway? Or you, to me?
I mean, are you my girlfriend?
And when you win...
does that make me, like, First Boyfriend?
First Concubine?
About that article... I'm sorry.
I hate apologies.
I'm sorry.
I looked over at you. I watched you watching.
  When?   Did it even affect you?
The beheading?
Why would you ask that?
I had no sense of what you were thinking.
None.
Of what I was thinking? I wasn't thinking.
I was thinking, "Don't think."
And I'll tell you something else.
I never said I like being careful.
  God damn it.   What's wrong?
The GPS thinks we're back at the White House.
Did you reach the campaign office?
Trying. I can't get a signal.
Oh, wait. Here we go.
I can't miss this flight.
  It's ringing.   Good.
  How long do you think?   Now it stopped.
There's a pile-up on the highway. I'm doing the best I can.
Hello?
Hello!
Tanya, let me try your phone.
I'm having the same issues.
Can you get through to the office?
No, Governor, I can't.
Garrett is a good man.
  A trustworthy man?   Absolutely, Mr. Romero.
And is he the kind of man
who would knowingly participate in campaign finance fraud?
I wouldn't say that, exactly. No.
How well do you know President Underwood, sir?
I've known the president four years.
Isn't it a fact that it was Francis Underwood
and not President Walker who first suggested you should resign?
To the best of my recollection, no.
And isn't it true that the source of campaign funds you received
as the president's running mate was connected
to a pay-for-play scheme
that reached all the way from Missouri to China?
To the best of my knowledge, no.
Did you receive any campaign donations
through Raymond Tusk's firm, Clayton West?
Not to the best of my recollection.
Do you think your recollection
or knowledge will improve as the day goes on?
Excuse me?
Beth.
I want you to promise me that you'll call me
anytime you need anything.
You were the love of Tim's life, you know that.
Well, I should probably...
Yes. You, too.
Goodbye.
Thank you, Felix.
Uh, would you like me to prepare it for you, sir?
No, I'll be fine. Thank you.
The first question to ask yourself... "Is the damper open?"
Never allow yourself to be overcome with smoke.
Conflagration relies on airflow. That's what the grate is for.
Now, I like a one-inch base of ash.
It's helpful, but of course
they clean up around here too soon to do that.
Now, as for the architecture of the logs,
I prefer the upside-down method.
Largest logs right along the base.
Then medium-size logs after that.
Small logs.
And then finally, kindling...
and tinder.
Now, of course, back home, dead palmetto fronds are ideal.
But, of course, here in Washington,
we have to use whatever garbage we find lying around.
But then, if a man cannot use what's right in...
God damn it, Tim.
If a man is not smart enough
to be able to use whatever is in front of him
and still make it work...
well, then... that's just a failure of the imagination.
...right here. And I'm thinking...
"Wait, do I tell him? Do  "
Uh, I gotta take this.
Your testimony can't be private.
  I'm sorry to hear that.   Just wanted to let you know.
What's a "flash blood warning"?
It's coming up on everybody's phones.
Thanks for the drinks.
Tom, stop. No. I... I have to get back.
Come on.
No.
Tom!
And, finally, you strike your match...
you ignite your kindling...
and then you blow.
It's happening, sir.
Citizens should be advised,
a wave of disruptions is currently affecting
Internet and cellular service in the DC area.
Expect traffic and travel delays
as authorities are still trying
to determine the scope of the problem.
  Are we gonna make this flight?   I don't know.
Unconfirmed reports speculate
the disruptions may be connected to a cyber-attack
with possible ties to ICO.
  My God.   What?
Maybe they were right.
Maybe we should have said yes to the offer of those troops.
National Guard on patrol
makes us look weak right before an election. Forget it.
  But, Governor     I made my decision, Tanya.
Not yet.
They're patching through the heads of all the carriers, sir.
Gentlemen and ladies, can you hear me?
Yes, Mr. President.
Good. Then tell me how in God's name this has happened.
Uh, we don't know yet, sir. We're still working on the problem.
We're reaching out to as many people as we  
Did we just lose them?
Is this a joke?
The Ohio governor is calling from a payphone.
This is the president.
Mr. President, I've changed my mind.
If the offer's still open,
I'd like to accept additional troops for the state of Ohio.
Just say the word, Roger. Whatever you need.
My fellow Americans, the facts are these.
The greater District of Columbia area and the immediate region beyond
have undergone what we suspect is an ICO-sponsored cyber-attack.
The attack was aimed at
the district's main telecom switching center.
In addition to intermittent outages,
a considerable amount of havoc has been wreaked.
Traffic lights have been disabled.
One area train has been derailed.
The system that maintains our sewers has been tampered with.
The perpetrators were targeting the government
and their ultimate purpose, though foiled,
was to disrupt all mid-Atlantic transportation networks.
Events like these underscore
the urgency of my request to Congress
for a declaration of war.
Tonight, I can only suspect
Congress will spend a dark night of the soul,
after which they will reconsider their paralysis and choose to act.
Capital East Telecom has informed me
that it's repairing the network as fast as possible,
but that it will take at least a couple more days to be fully restored.
It is an unfortunate but undeniable fact
that we will continue to experience attacks
until ICO and other terrorist groups like it
are eliminated swiftly and completely.
Thank you. May God bless you.
And may God bless the United States of America.
We off?
  Good evening, Ted.   Hi, Hannah.
I saw your interview.
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't bring up the details of my combat record.
You were a hero that day. You should use it, Will.
Governor, aren't you worried about
bringing your kids out in the middle of a terrorist attack?
It'd be scarier to keep the kids at home.
The streets are safe. Life goes on.
You've got to be kidding me.
What's on your mind, Governor?
What's on my mind? I mean, you see what's going on here.
This is all him. It's a man who's never served.
Wouldn't know what a real war was
if it jumped up and bit him in the ass.
I mean, a declaration of war?
He's putting American lives in danger.
  War is real!   Nightcap?
  You don't screw around with it.   Why not?
This is what happens.
This is what happens when you throw around a word like "War."
All hell breaks loose.House.of.Cards.SE
I don't have the right words for what happened that day.
But he was a hero, no question.
Captain Conway's conduct was heroic.
A hero.
Army Captain Craig Squire had been captured by the Taliban,
held hostage in the Kandahar province.
We realized the intel was bad.
By the time we found him, we'd started taking fire.
It was like a death garden or something.
Captain Conway got out of the plane and got Squire out.
Don't even ask me how.
This election is too important.
You have a choice between Francis Underwood and a real hero.
This is what happens when you throw around a word like "War."
All hell breaks loose.
He saved Squire. He saved all of us.
War is real.
Paid for by Americans for Truth.
I don't know how many times I have to go through this,
but my campaign had nothing to do with that ad.
That was a super PAC.
  I know, but     But those soldiers, though.
They're the ones.
This country owes them a lot.
  But that ad is on all the time.   You wanna know why?
Because Frank Underwood has failed to keep this country safe.
The death of James Miller,
the so-called ICO attack at Capital East Telecom network...
Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying ICO wasn't responsible?
I'm saying it doesn't matter.
The Internet went down on the president's watch.
  Don't you think ICO was     Now listen, Fred  
No, ICO is a real threat.
There's a lot of people waiting
and I promised one question per person.
It was great talking to you,
and please don't forget to vote tomorrow.
Now, how long have we been going, anyway?
  Four hours.   Four hours.
That means we got  hours to go
and I haven't even had the chance to thank my friends at Pollyhop
for making this all possible and live streaming this event.
Benjamin Grant and his crew.
All right. What's the next question?
Annie? Annie from Maine. What's on your mind?
Was Fred one of ours?
I think so. We're gonna keep hitting the ad.
LeAnn's got callers lined up. Are you there yet?
Almost. Then back on the plane.
  I'm about to go on.   Ohio, still?
Oh, yeah. And how's he looking? Conway?
Well, he's only four hours in. It's not sustainable.
  But is he commanding?   He's arrogant, Francis.
  Mr. President?   I have to go.
Okay. See you in Gettysburg.
You're saying it doesn't matter
if Underwood knew about pay-for-play?
Well, I'm saying it's bad either way.
He either stole the presidency from his own party,
or he was vice president in a corrupt administration.
But it's important that we let the committee do its job.
So thanks for your call, Annie.
Arthur Capo from Del Rey Beach, Hawaii. Arthur, how you doing?
Why did they want to talk to you?
I'm sorry, who? Uh, what's your question, Arthur?
Josh Masterson and Zachary...
I forget his last name. But the terrorists who killed Jim Miller.
Right. Uh, well...
All I know is what they said in their list of demands.
And they believed I would be elected president.
But really, why? Why you?
I successfully negotiated
the release of Caroline and Melissa Miller.
  But not Jim Miller.   I wasn't given the chance.
What's your read on him, the way he answers those questions?
  He's hiding something.   Right.
But it doesn't matter.
He's modern. He makes the presidency accessible.
I mean, don't you want to see the candidate stay up all night?
Are you calling Francis old?
I appreciate the applause, ladies and gentlemen,
but I imagine it's for the woman you really came to see.
"These are dangerous times."
These are dangerous times.
...of the United States,
Claire Underwood.
He's only a couple years older than me, you know.
Thank you. Thank you, Nevada!
I really appreciate you all coming out here this morning.
No substitute for retail politics. Especially her brand.
Thank you.
Could you get me some water, please?
Hello, everyone.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much. That's very kind.
Oh, thanks so much.
Oh, now stop that.
Stop it, stop it. Enough, enough, enough. Enough.
It's embarrassing, all of that adulation.
Hello, nice to see you. Thank you so much for coming out.
Much appreciated.
  Jack!   Great speech, Mr. President.
It's like you're saying what I'm thinking.
Well, that is the idea. Thank you.
Uh, I'm a little worried about the Conway thing, though.
Bringing up a lot of questions.
But not a lot of answers.
Yeah, and we don't need to keep hearing about that article
the day before the election.
What are we doing about it?
Well, we're here, Jack.
We are fighting back one handshake at a time.
Gwendolyn, you look absolutely stunning.
May I get a photograph, please, Steve?
Could you do this, please? Make sure you cut him out.
We have Jeff from Corpus Christi, Texas.
How are you doing today, Jeff?
We saw the ad. About the rescue.
You know, Jeff, I feel like we have been through this already.
You saved my brother's life, sir.
Craig Squire.
Captain Squire. That's... that's your brother?
Captain.
Remember me?
I do remember. Of course I remember.
I didn't think you wanted talk about it.
We lived through it. That's enough, isn't it?
I never got to thank you and tell you...
Captain Squire, you would've done the same.
I don't know. I was in there.
They were tossing bodies on top of me, one after the other...
I was already dead.
That's not right. It's like I've been dead once already.
But the bodies... the way they were stuck together.
And the heat and the smell...
But you know when you were pulling me out, remember?
I... I don't remember much, actually.
It all happened pretty quick.
I know you heard it.
You have to get him out of this question.
He doesn't like talking about this. You know that.
Hannah, let's talk.
Come on, man. I know you did.
I was just trying to get us out of there as fast as I could.
Craig, we're here.
  We made it.   Yeah, but...
You gotta live your life.
Thanks for taking our call.
Thank you.
He didn't call him out enough. He didn't get Conway to  
Look... he did what he could.
What did he hear? What did he mean by that?
I don't know. It's between Will and him.
He's wanted Will to come clean about it for a long time, but...
it didn't happen.
Which is why, for Craig's sake,
we need to get them back on the phone.
Miss Harvey, you've been on us for months.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
If this means the deal's off, okay.
We can always find a place to go.
Just let me talk to him again. We wouldn't want him to  
Jesus Christ! My brother has been through enough.
We're done.
I need you to leave.
He's doing great.
Is he?
That ad's playing for us.
Look, I... I agreed to this.
  But I know my husband.   I know you do.
And those questions were to be expected, yes?
It's a good thing Squire changed his mind.
We can pull some tape and put something together tonight.
Hit some markets in the morning.
When it's time to vote...
Will saved his life.
This is too much.
I don't want any more questions about the war.
That's not gonna work.
Look, I can show you numbers,
I can show you how well it's all playing for us.
What I'm saying, Mark, is that this  
I've been at this a long time, Hannah.
You know, when Marshall told me you were available  
Marshall and I go way back.
The timing is right for all of us, right?
We're very grateful.
Then he will tell you, I don't get involved,
not this late in the game, unless
I know I can make a difference.
So whatever happened to Will with Squire, whatever...
  It's not     I don't wanna know. I don't need to know.
But whatever pain he's carrying about what happened...
it's working for us.
So, this is what I need from you.
To go back out there
and just make sure he makes it through until morning.
He has a chance to be a fine president.
A great president.
Even better.
Because we could use one.
There's a reason that Squire didn't appear in that ad.
I'm just nailing down the specifics.
  Let's bring Doug in on this.   He's on his way to Philly.
And with all due respect, sir,
his skill set doesn't necessarily apply here.
Do you know how long Doug has worked for me, LeAnn?
Not exactly, no.
Well, it's just this side of forever.
I know everything about him.
His strengths, his weaknesses, his skill set
and the contents of his soul.
I hope you're not questioning my loyalty.
I just like to know about the people who work for me, LeAnn.
  I'm pretty straightforward.   I don't believe that for a second.
The first time I sat down with Doug,
it was more of a confession than a conversation.
He told me about his drinking, his past.
He was completely open with me.
I don't think we can rely on Craig Squire.
Then why am I still talking to you?
I'm not hiding the contents of my soul, sir.
Reach out to Vanessa Morrison.
I already reached out to the director.
Yes, but Doug hasn't.
So have him do it and then you come up with something else
before Conway is done with his little sideshow.
And in terms of what comes next,
I adjusted the opening remarks and cut some from the stump.
The stump is just fine.
Thank you very much.
Get me the First Lady, please.
Well, the... the short answer is
in a democracy, everyone has the same rights...
the same opportunities.
Hello.
Do the people around us understand what it takes?
Look, I know Conway's getting a bump,
but it doesn't mean we can't surmount it in the next  hours.
Do they know what we have done to get this far?
Tom is sitting across from me right now.
I don't care who you're sitting next to, Claire.
We're all doing everything we can as fast as we can.
I don't like it. I don't like chasing this.
What's your next stop?
  We, uh... We're in Scranton in .   You need to save your voice.
I'll see you on the battlefield.
How's the President doing?
He's acting like he's still  years old.
We both are.
Is that good... or bad?
That depends on if we win or lose.
Because I'm a vet
and I'm still not clear on exactly what happened.
You know, I think everything
has been said by the soldiers who were there.
No. 'Cause your plane,
was it shot down or was it a planned rescue?
Planned, yes.
Until the plan had to change.
  I think you get the idea.   No, I don't get it, sir.
  You were a pilot, right?   Yes.
So why were your boots even on the ground?
Our intel was flawed.
Our intel was flawed and I... I had to step in. I had to.
Hi, Mike.
My husband is a humble man.
You're never going to get the details of his bravery that day.
At least, not from him.
To me, his comrades say it all.
Will is a man who is equipped to deal with whatever comes at him.
And now, I'd like to put in a word on a more practical matter,
these new centralized voting centers.
Because we've had lots of calls and questions.
Whichever candidate you support,
it's essential that you get out to vote.
Ask a neighbor for a ride or call your local party office.
This race is too close for complacency.
You got my vote!
  Underwood!   Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Could you also get me a tea with honey, please?
  Are you gonna be all right to speak?   Yeah, I'm fine.
  Listen to your voice, Francis.   Stop.
You have been running yourself into the ground,
you haven't slept for days.
Why don't you kick off the speech,
let me take over, and then I will explain to...
That the president's lost his voice?
No, you're not gonna say that.
We're not gonna have that headline as we enter the final stretch.
Especially since Sir Lancelot is out there yapping all day long.
I'm not really sure that Conway's a Sir Lancelot.
Oh, really? Then who would you assign that role to?
God, I hate to waste that. Excuse me.
There was a young man in line,
on the other side, sort of against that second door.
Six foot tall...
  Maybe just give us a moment.   Sure.
Can you see if you can get some contact information?
Or pull him out if you can. Thank you.
I didn't mean take over. I just meant let's appear as a ticket.
  "Are we united or are we divided?"   Francis  
"Here at Gettysburg, one of the bloodiest battles  "
I know your speech.
But can you finish? You have to know how to finish, Claire.
I have the distinct honor of introducing you to,
God-willing and the creek don't rise,
the current and next President of the United States of America,
Francis Underwood!
Thank you.
Thank you, Congressman Winters,
and thank you, Pennsylvania.
And my running mate, my wife,
and my friend and my partner, Claire Underwood.
I've always got a few minutes for Doug Stamper.
Again, sorry to keep you waiting.
You sure I can't offer you something?
I don't drink, Governor.
Well, I got club soda, tonic...
You said you were going to establish voting centers.
I was. I tried.
I got pushback from the precinct captains
like you wouldn't believe.
  You said you were gonna deploy troops.   I tried that, too.
I floated the order past Roger Frank at the ACLU.
He mentioned it to Barney Leonard at the Black Coalition.
And within two hours, I got eight angry phone calls
telling me exactly what would happen
if I chose to protect exurban areas instead of Philly.
You don't want to lie to me, Governor.
I just came from Barney Leonard's office.
  You wanna change your story?   Please.
Barney's gonna tell you that he threatened a fucking race riot.
You fucking lied, straight up,
to the President of the United States.
Doug.
Doug.
  Barney Leonard's office, please.   Put the phone down.
It's Doug Stamper.
Yes, I need him one more time.
Fine. Hang it up.
I'll get you your troops.
You want the truth?
Not interested. I had that coming in.
It's over.
Underwood's gonna lose tomorrow. He's done.
And when he's done, you're done.
You'll have nothing left. And then, you'll just disappear.
Thank you for your time, Governor.
What would it take to
federalize the National Guard in Pennsylvania?
The president asked me to get him some information
about Eric Rawlings.
  Who?   From the Gettysburg event.
I'll give it to him.
Muhammed Kalabi, , Syrian national.
Local assets confirm his ID with high confidence.
Kalabi has strong connections to ICO.
Bombing in Beirut last fall.
A month before Beirut,
with Ahmadi, in Cairo.
Currently, sir, there are four Muhammed Kalabis
in the United States.
Two are approximately the same age as the ICO Kalabi,
and one entered the United States three weeks ago
from Afghanistan by way of Canada.
He's visiting his girlfriend in Tennessee
who works at a Knoxville bookstore.
So why are you bringing me all this?
You asked for options, sir.
To arrest Muhammed Kalabi on election day?
Cathy, what's gonna happen
when he tells the authorities he's the wrong one?
But that would be after the election  
Well, that might have played three or four days ago, Cathy,
but now it's too late.
Did you have this three or four days ago?
I would have brought it to you, sir.
All right, well, let's leave it at that.
Send in Doug.
The secretary is just leaving.
That's all we have on the Squire rescue.
It's not enough, unfortunately.
Sir...
when it comes to Matthews, I don't believe he'll deliver.
Let's take this from his hands. We need to protect the polls.
The request won't come from you.
The way this thing is built, you're nowhere near it.
Hold on a second.
How are the numbers in Pennsylvania?
They're good, but they're well within the margin of error, sir.
So we don't want to look like
we're shoving an armed unit of National Guards
down Jim Matthews' throat, right?
  Right.   So, I got a call from Barney Leonard.
You pushed too hard, Doug.
But look, we'll have four years to take care of Matthews,
and we will.
But what if there was another way?
I don't think anybody, if they're honest with themselves,
can say they truly trust President Underwood.
Why should they?
With so many threats to our country,
now it's more important than ever to elect...
...four years of misguided priorities,
backing the GOP into soliciting private and special interests.
You know what?
What?
  I wanna be that person.   What person?
The person that does this for, like, an hour and then leaves.
That's not what this  
Doug, I've been having sex for as long as you have.
And when you called me, that's what it sounded like.
And I thought, "Great."
But I'm here now. Where are you?
I should take you home.
No.
  You don't have to.   Come on.
  I'll take a cab.   I'm taking you home.
What is going on with you?
You're right. I shouldn't have called.
I gotta get back to work.
Reports are pouring in of protests being staged
outside of many of our newly established voting centers.
Which begs the question, are Americans fed up
with our politicians' seemingly unquenchable thirst for conflict?
Between Underwood's call for a formal...
Make a decision?
...and the strong military ticket on the Republican side?
Basil Hayden's, double, neat.
Basil Hayden?
You're killing me, buddy.
  What do you got?   Bulleit's as good as it gets in here.
I'll have that.
  Woman?   Work.
Yeah, well, nothing's forever, man.
Those two down there,
and anyone else who comes in here until that's gone.
That's for you.
I couldn't sleep.
Is it your throat?
Is it enough?
What we're doing?
I...
Yes.
Then why aren't we farther ahead?
Most of the polls have us  
Oh, I don't trust the polls.
With few exceptions, I don't trust anyone or anything.
We won't know for sure until the vote's begun.
But turnout for their side is sure to be down.
We almost had Conway today.
And we did some damage.
And maybe we don't know what he's hiding,
but the public knows there's something out there.
He hums in his sleep sometimes.
Hums?
Like what?
I don't know.
Nothing recognizable.
Does he do it often?
Sometimes.
Do it for me. What's it sound like?
Let's get you something for your throat.
No, I'm fine. You go back to sleep.
We're gonna get there tomorrow, Francis.
So, I'm... I'm at this fundraiser.
It's a beautiful house on the beach in Amagansett,
and I've been dancing all night with this incredible girl,
way out of my league.
But it's late, very late,
and I'm a very responsible young man, so...
I sneak upstairs to get my jacket.
But lo and behold...
she's following me.
And I see my reflection in the hallway mirror and...
I'm just sweating like a pig.
My heart's racing.
And she walks up behind me.
And as I turn...
I see the moonlight on her face...
and everything just slows down.
And that's how we met.
Me and Hannah.
Well, I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one up this late.
Mr. President, do you have a question for me?
No, I don't. But I thought I would give you the chance
to ask me a question. Just one.
I'm not sure I have any questions for you.
Don't be shy, Will.
I mean, after all, this is a rare opportunity.
Just between you and me.
It's just you and me and all the other Americans out there
having trouble sleeping tonight.
Well, that's because they know
that tomorrow's vote will decide their future.
So that's the question then, isn't it?
Who does the future belong to?
Well, I don't think anyone but God can answer that one.
All we can do is make a case for ourselves while we're here.
Okay.
Here's my question.
I successfully negotiated
the release of Caroline and Melissa Miller.
Then you stepped in.
You didn't let me finish the job. Why?
Do you really want me to answer that question, Will?
  Because I'm not sure you do.   Oh, I do.
Because they knew they could take advantage of you.
They saw it.
  How's that, sir?   They felt it.
Whatever happened to you overseas,
there's no reason to feel guilty or ashamed.
I served my country. I did what I did...
because it's what I had to do.
Not like some others.
I've been in public office my entire adult life, Will.
The truth is, I went to school with guys like you.
Good looking guys with good intentions...
just like you.
And I mean that sincerely.
And I want you to know that whatever happens tomorrow,
I never doubted your intentions.
Must be late for you, Mr. President. Get some sleep.
I doubt either of us will be getting much sleep tonight.
But thank you for taking my call.
Well, thank you for calling.
Now, there's only one more question, and it's a big one.
And you're gonna have to answer it yourselves.
Who's gonna be the next President of the United States?
I know who I'm voting for.
I'd like to thank everyone who made the last  hours possible.
All the... the technicians and crew.
And if we all work together the way they have, then I promise,
we will truly make this the first of many, many new days
for the greatest country in the world.
Good morning, America. God bless America, and thank you.
And we're out. Okay, guys.
You did great.
  You did it.   Yeah.
Everyone is so pleased.
I know it was tough, but you got through it.
  I'm really proud of you.   Thank you.
Just some questions that I needed to answer.
I know. But you did it. You did it.
  Great job.   That was great.
  Amazing.   Thank you.
Testing, testing. One, two, three.
Testing. One, two, three.
A little more gain. A skosh more reverb.
Testing, testing, testing. That's good. That's good.
I would like to thank the American people
for their overwhelming support tonight.
As your next president, I do not take this mandate lightly.
In fact... it is heavy as hell.
You got a better chance than Underwood does.
Those are very high heels, Bridget.
When Underwood loses, the committee goes away.
You're breaking my heart.
I was looking forward to
hearing what you had to say about Doug Stamper.
Yeah, I was looking forward to saying it.
I came here to thank you.
I took it down... off the Internet.
It's weird, talking to you about this. I mean...
you saw it.
My brother could've seen that.
Do I remind you of your brother?
He's a little more present.
Well, it's my job to look ahead.
Good luck with that.
  Thank you so very much.   Thank you, sir.
We have the overnight numbers.
Give me the outliers.
Minus two in New York. Plus two in New Hampshire.
Both not bad.
"Half-empty, half-full" is an expression I have never cared for.
The call you made last night, it's helping.
We grabbed the headlines this morning.
  Doug?   Yes, sir.
I want you to reach out to Sally Ann back in Gaffney
and get me the turnout so far.
I can get you the numbers for the state.
No, I don't want that. I want the Gaffney turnout.
State numbers come in, you give them to us as they come.
Anything out of the ordinary, you let us know.
Other than that, we're done. Oh, and, Doug?
  Yes, sir.   You'll know where to find us.
You're worried about the crowd we just saw.
Not the size. Their enthusiasm.
I don't think so.
Jerry, I'm gonna have to call you back.
This  a.m. turnout in our base precincts or swing?
Base.
Shit.
I've got different numbers. You're gonna need  
I did confirm. Twice.
Doug, it's me. Call me as soon as you get this.
You handle just automobile insurance or all kinds?,
All kinds. Fire, earthquake,
theft, public liability.
Group insurance, industrial stuff, and so on right down the line.
Accident insurance?
Accident insurance? Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.
Wish you'd tell me what's engraved on that anklet.
  Just my name.   As for instance?
  Phyllis.   Phyllis, huh? I think I like that.
Let's do this one.
I'd drive it around the block a couple of times.
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by tomorrow evening around :?
He'll be in then.
  Who?   My husband.
You were anxious to talk to him, weren't you?
Yeah, I was. But, uh...
I'm sort of getting over the idea, if you know what I mean.
There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff.
Forty-five miles an hour.
  How fast was I going, Officer?   I'd say around .
Suppose you get off that motorcycle and give me a ticket.
So I'd let you off with a warning this time.
Suppose it doesn't take.
Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles.
Suppose I burst out crying and put my head on your shoulder.
Suppose you try putting that on my husband's shoulders.
That tears it.
I'm just not in the mood  
Oh, no. Come on, it's tradition.
If Doug needs us, he'll call.
Yes, but it's different this time. There's so much going on  
  I know, but call me superstitious.   We're in here.
But we have done this every election we have ever won.
  Come on.   I wonder if I know what you mean.
I wonder if you wonder.
It was a hot afternoon, and I still remember
the smell of honeysuckle all down that street.
How could I have known that murder...
can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?
Maybe you would've known, Keyes,
the minute she mentioned accident insurance.
But I didn't. I felt like a million.
Yes.
I went back to the office to see if I had any mail.
Well, what do you mean they don't match?
In my home state?
Well, you and LeAnn better get over here right now.
What's the matter?
There's something wrong with the numbers in the precincts
that we're getting from this morning. They don't match up.
It's never happened before in South Carolina.
Well, you have nothing to say about that?
I'm sure the numbers are wrong.
You don't believe that for a second.
I can't win with you.
No matter what I say.
How many times did you walk me home?
What?
I don't know. Probably a handful.
No, it wasn't a handful.
It was ... in a month.
It was on my way home.
  And what are you saying?   Nothing. It was on my way home.
No, it wasn't just on your way home.
We tried to go to the Museum of Fine Arts.
  It was closed. It was freezing that day.   Yeah.
  And this was on in your room.   It was.
And I asked you to kiss me. I made you kiss me.
No, you didn't make me kiss you. I wanted to kiss you.
And anyway, I knew we were
gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
And we are.
No regrets, no matter what.
What does that mean?
What do you mean by that, "No matter what"?
  You think we're gonna lose?   No!
No.
Are we together?
Yes, we're together. No matter what  
No, not "No matter what." Are we together?
We're together, Francis.
Then don't ever bring up losing around me again.
  That's the boy.   Thank you, Mr. Keyes.
What kind of an outfit is this, anyway?
Are we an insurance company
or just a bunch of dim-witted amateurs
to write a policy on a mug like that?
Now, wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate this beef.
The turnout in Philly is lower than they're saying.
  How much lower?     in our key precincts.
Thirty? How?
It's not just Pennsylvania. People aren't voting.
Their people, our people.
Wait. If Conway's got Pennsylvania,
then he's got Ohio.
If he's got Ohio, then we lose.
  How did this happen?   I'll tell them.
That is one thing you are not doing.
That was all there was to it.
Nothing had slipped, nothing had been overlooked.
There was nothing to give us away.
And yet, Keyes,
as I was walking down the street to the drugstore,
suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong.
It sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it's true, so help me.
I couldn't hear my own footsteps.
It was the walk of a dead man.
That was the longest night I ever lived through, Keyes.
And the next day was worse when the story broke in the papers.
They started talking about it at the office.
And the day after that, when you started digging into it.
I kept my hands in my pockets
because I thought they were shaking.
I put on dark glasses so people couldn't see my eyes,
then I took them off again
so they wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.
  I tried to hold myself together but...   Thank you.
...I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces.
Get me Sally Ann
in the Cherokee County clerk's office in South Carolina.
I'll hold.
They overestimated the turnouts in Pennsylvania by  .
Hi, y'all.
Well, now, do not call me "Sir."
This is Francis Underwood.
We've known each other too long for that.
So, Sally, how was turnout today?
Well, I was just really actually looking for Cherokee County.
Yes, I just wanted to hear it for myself.
Great. Thank you.
And we send our love to Henry and the boys.
Goodbye.
  It's low.   What do you mean, "Low"?
Low.
I was thinking about that anklet.
And what are you thinking about now?
I'm all through thinking, baby.
I just came to say goodbye.
Goodbye? Where are you going?
You're the one that's going, baby. Not me.
I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner.
Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's have it, whatever it is.
All right, I'll tell you.
Friend of mine's got a funny theory...
You know what this means, don't you?
This is our house.
We are not leaving.
The last stop's a cemetery.House.of.Cards.SE
I don't understand why the numbers are so low.
  It doesn't make any sense.   Turnout's bad.
I hear at Politico, they're concentrating mostly on Conway art.
Shut up or you're fired.
...division rivals.
The fighting was quite a spectacle
but, unfortunately for hockey fans,
that was just about the only action
to be seen in last night's game.
Will, Mark's here.
Hope you got some sleep.
No, not really.
Even went for a run, but...
You hungry?
Um, I just wanted to connect
before the rest of this day kicks in.
I spoke to Marshall.
No, I told him.
Things are looking good.
Very good.
I really want to thank you for everything. I mean, the ad and  
I had nothing to do with that ad.
No, of course, but...
to thank you for your support.
This is all you.
Listen...
I'm... choosing my words very carefully here.
You need to get ready.
Today's gonna be a good day.
You can sleep when you get to the White House.
Or maybe not.
Get yourself together, Will. I'll see you in a bit.
Are you ready...
to catch me?
Doug, LeAnn... do you have a moment?
Reporting live from the Piedmont Hotel,
the excitement is definitely in the air right now.
Better not let them see the name on your credentials.
Those folks out there love their president.
I love pound cake.
Doesn't mean it's good for me.
How are you doing, Seth?
  You got some foundation right here.   Oh, jeez.
And we call it the news.
I'm doing commentary.
Which means eventually someone gets to ask me
if my articles affected the president's loss.
Or his win.
I wish you the best, Seth.
You'll land somewhere.
You're that type.
We're going to have a great night tonight.
You don't have to spin me.
How shall I say this?
When I was single, I always picked the loser's party.
I met the last Mrs. Hammerschmidt drowning in tequila shots
at the Bob Dole ballroom.
And here I am... single again.
  You're not in Texas anymore.   Doug, please.
  Please what?   Don't think you know me.
Look, I just want to be sure that you're ready for  
Macallan will do what he has to.
I like to win.
Trophies, medals, staring contests. You name it.
You understand that, you understand me.
Hello, everyone.
Well, it's still early.
There's a lot more election to be had today.
And we just want to apologize that,
because we have a little more work to do,
we're not gonna be able to get over to the ballroom
as early as we would like to.
But once we do get there,
we are going to shake the hand of each and every one of you,
to thank you for all the extraordinary work
that you've done for us.
That's right, a round of applause all the way around.
And we'll see you all at the party a little later.
Better?
Yeah, a little.
First time I've fucked a president.
  Oh, don't say that.   Marshall said...
I'm not a president yet.
Almost.
I got to put on a suit.
  People will be here soon.   Will...
can't you let yourself feel it?
Almost.
  Ready when you are, sir.   Put the governor on, please.
  Hello.   Mitch, this is the president.
I understand you've been briefed.
Oh, Mr. President...
this is catching us all off guard over here.
State, local, we had no idea.
I understand.
I'm with the vice president, the Secretary of State Durant,
and on the line with us is Counterterrorism Director Green.
Governor, sir, I'm sorry, but we needed to act.
I contacted local law enforcement directly.
Well, it took a while to get to me.
Mitch, the Counterterrorism Director will be sharing information
that we must keep amongst ourselves.
We do not want to do anything that affects today's voting.
Forty-five minutes ago,
we raided the home of Muhammed Kalabi, sir.
On Deaderick Ave.
  Yes.   It's near the Coliseum.
The suspect was not in his apartment,
but we did find bomb-making material.
  Jesus, uh...   Now, Mitch...
the last thing we want is for you to panic.
You must know that you have the full support
of the federal government here.
Um, it... Well, what... what's next?
We believe his target is one of the voting centers.
We know you have soldiers in place,
security measures and checkpoints.
Director Green is on his way to you.
There will be a command center out of the FBI office in Knoxville
where we will coordinate.
My family voted at the Coliseum this morning.
Mitch, listen to me.
Whatever you need, we will provide.
How are the Ohio numbers?
It's hard to gauge with turnout this low.
That was kind of the point.
For the other side, not Democrats.
The governor's worried. Do you have any numbers?
No, just what we gave you.
I would think that the president
might have access to some numbers that we don't.
When I get them, you'll get them.
  We're worried.   Hang in there.
I'll touch base with you after the three o'clock wave.
If you could all just give me a moment, please. Thank you.
You better head over to the ballroom.
One of us should make an appearance.
Sir, the day has finally arrived.
Yes, and let's see just how long this day lasts.
Imagine my surprise when the NSA called me
about Muhammed Kalabi just...
moments before you did.
Situation is still unfolding.
On Election Day?
Francis...
it's been quite a journey working with you.
Kalabi slipped into the country,
and he's planning a terrorist attack
against a voting center in Tennessee.
And that is a terrifying proposition.
Well, I may need you to stay around
the White House a bit longer, Cathy,
until this situation is resolved.
Of course.
I was only saying...
it's been a good run.
As if she could ever get under my skin.
I don't need to get to the party just yet.
Sweaty palms, eager to pay me their last respects.
When what they really want to do to show their respect
is to empty their bullets in my body,
just to make sure that I'm dead.
Patti, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
Miss Harvey was just telling me
that there's been a change in the schedule.
Yes, unfortunately, we're in a bit of an emergency.
But I hope it will be resolved soon.
Tom, hello.
  You know Mr. Yates, don't you?   Yes,
we met at the convention.
So LeAnn will be at the hotel.
She can reach me
if you feel I need to be there sooner rather than later.
In case it's later...
I want you to think four years down the road.
  I'm sorry?   They trust you.
Four years is no time.
We have a car waiting.
So we're shaking hands today?
I think it's best we keep it like that.
Well, shake it like you mean it.
How's that?
So you want me to just head over to the ballroom?
No.
No.
I do like looking at you across a large room.
Victory.
This is for when you win.
I wrote a concession speech as well.
With increased security at polling places across the country,
will fewer Americans vote for the president this year
than in any election in recent memory?
Particular attention is being paid to typical battleground states,
Ohio and Pennsylvania,
where voter turnout has become a central issue
that could make all the difference in this historic election.
You know, if turnout is low in Philadelphia...
the Underwoods are going under.
You need a better in than that.
You look like you've been chewed up and shit out twice today.
Seems like you're having trouble focusing.
You ever see a doctor about that?
What?
Oh, 'cause I feel pretty comfortable diagnosing you
with too much on your fucking mind.
Let me get you something real. I'm celebrating.
Two Oban.
Celebrating what?
You know Tom Hammerschmidt's long lead team?
You're looking at the newest member.
That guy never gives up.
I tell you what he's up to, feed him things from you.
Don't you think it's a little late for quid pro quo?
The Underwoods could still win.
We'll see.
Either way, you still have a couple more months.
Yeah.
I'll land somewhere.
Your phone.
Can somebody give me a second today, you know?
Shit. Excuse me.
Hello?
...while reports are coming in
of a possible attack at a Knoxville voting center.
Now, let's take a live look...
Tennessee? What's going on in Tennessee?
...it's a very chaotic scene at the moment.
What?
...there's a lot happening right now.
Police are... are, of course,
trying to keep everyone calm and safe here.
And we will bring you...
Where the hell were you?
Tennessee. What the hell's going on in Tennessee?
Muhammed Kalabi,
the ICO guy from Syria who burned the effigy.
What's the plan?
I stand before you this evening as vice presidential candidate,
as the First Lady of the United States,
and most of all... as a citizen of this great country.
Despite the violent incident at the voting center in Knoxville,
which the president is attending to as we speak,
we want to assure anyone who's considering not voting
that it is not only safe to vote, it is your duty to do so.
It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat.
It doesn't matter if you're a Republican.
Our nation needs you to vote today.
Violence cannot beget apathy.
We must make our voices heard.
Seth!
Witnesses report an FBI and Homeland presence
at the Knoxville voting center.
Do you believe this is ICO-related?
Seth, please! Come on.
  And the FBI isn't talking.   Neither are you, Gina.
This isn't a presser, because I didn't schedule one.
  We're just trying to find out     That's two, Gina.
If you're looking for a strikeout, I'm happy to oblige.
No? Good.
There's no questions at this time.
The First Lady's statement stands as is.
I will have updates for you on Tennessee as I get them.
Is everyone clear? Thank you.
Seth!
I'm told everything just went wrong.
  The FBI had the bomb guys there...   But, Mitch...
...for crying out loud!
...injuries didn't go beyond scrapes and bruises.
Oh, I don't know about that, Shawna.
Twelve people were taken to the hospital.
Look, is there any status on Green's ETA?
  Secretary Stewart and I...   Yes. Just a moment, sir.
  ...cannot make a determination without     You need to take this.
What? What?
What the hell is this?
Hello.
Governor. Mark Usher here.
I think we met at the conference in Sun Valley.
Yes, that's right.
Well, I wish I were calling under better circumstances.
I wanted to know what you're going to need.
I can get some excellent people down there fast in case you...
you're feeling like you need the extra security or...
You there?
I'm right here, yeah.
I spoke to Shawna a few minutes ago,
and we agreed that we absolutely cannot disrupt this election.
You called my secretary of state?
Well, she called me.
She is a leader of the party in Tennessee. As are you.
Do I need to remind you, sir, that yours is a red state,
and every Republican in it is counting on you?
  Thank you, Mr. Usher.   Now, hold on.
Shawna just wanted to ask
what can be done and what can't be done.
She's like the rest of us, trying to figure this thing out.
Because of the scale of a possible threat
which we're still trying to determine,
and because of the importance of these, uh, voting centers,
we're asking the governor to declare
  a state of emergency...   Will, could you please sit?
...so that we can provide more...
I don't like it.
Three o'clock wave said Tennessee's locked up, no matter what.
...into the event that took place here...
Love, no one can see.
What the hell?
...be potentially disturbing.
They don't bark when there's a bomb.
What do you mean, "They don't bark"?
The canine units don't bark when there's a bomb, Mr. President.
Yeah, but the whole building heard it.
They're trained to sit down when they detect a bomb.
  So did they sit down?   No.
Then there was no bomb.
We think the barking was provoked.
Provoked? Director Green, that'll be enough.
These dogs are our last line of defense, sir.
I think ICO got in there today.
And thank God they didn't get a bomb off,
but whatever operative they got in there,
I think, was used to provoke the riot.
I said that is enough.
You think ICO got all the way in that building
and then just decided not to set off a bomb?
  Well, there are     We are not going to disrupt the voting.
Mitch, would you please talk some sense into him?
  I     If we don't suspend,
the Bureau cannot guarantee the safety of these centers.
Unacceptable. Find Kalabi.
The governor does not wanna
have to institute a curfew this late in the game.
  And, Mitch...   Uh, yes, sir.
...you are not closing the polls.
You think we should?
I can't weigh in on this.
I need to talk to Shawna.
How many scandals should the public be expected to endure
before they say, "Enough"?
Before they say, "I'm staying home"?
Before they lose complete faith in this democratic republic?
This is a trend that dates back at least
to when Nixon avoided jail time.
Okay, we're out.
  You're good.   I don't need fans, Sean.
Just genuine appreciation.
Would you like a drink? One is brown and one is not.
  It's gonna be a long night.   That's not what I hear.
So, Tennessee...
Is the question.
And?
My date knew nothing.
Are you making the rounds?
Crowd's a little older than I'm used to, but...
yes, they're a talkative bunch... that don't say much.
I'll take the brown one.
That's Patricia Whittaker over there. Chairperson of the DNC.
She slapped me once in a bar in Omaha.
For the life of me, I can't tell you why.
There's something wrong with Tennessee.
Your date is either lying or denying.
What did you mean by this?
On the back of the speech?
Nothing. Forget it.
"There's still time"?
There's still time for what?
What are you doing?
You and your husband.
Getting ready to win an election.
I see the way you're acting.
Do you realize we have every intention of winning today?
Sure.
But then what?
I used to go to this cabin... up in Maine.
The windows don't close properly.
You can smell the ocean all summer long.
I do think it's better you go to the ballroom.
If you have not voted, I assure you, you will get the chance.
But I cannot, in good conscience,
allow balloting to continue until I am satisfied that it is safe.
To that end, as nightfall approaches,
I am announcing an enforced,
state-wide curfew, effective tonight.
p.m. central time,
in the eastern parts of this state,
you will be subject to detention and possible arrest.
What the hell's going on?
What's going on is we're gonna win Pennsylvania and Ohio.
That puts you over .
The polls are still open. People are still voting.
My gut says they're ours.
That's  without Tennessee.
That asshole's suspending the vote.
That's up to his secretary of state, and she's on our side.
  She's gonna have a choice after this?   Governor, listen to me.
I mean, how long do we let Francis Underwood
get away with this kind of shit? Huh? How long?
He won't get away with it.
He won't.
That was Tennessee governor...
Trust me.
...announcing a state-wide curfew.
Bullshit.
Voting centers all across the state are being shut down,
central time,
...
Five o'clock wave from Philly. I think we're home.
...detention and possible arrest. This announcement...
That Tennessee shit is crazy.
Crazy shit happens all the time.
This convenient?
Spare me the conspiracy talk.
The government's not that powerful... or competent.
A man can ask.
We're looking at  Underwood,  Conway.
Pennsylvania and Ohio?
Still too close, but it's almost six o' clock.
When we change Tennessee from Conway to undecided  
That brings Conway down
  to     Two thirty-four. Still way too close.
Yes, but we don't yet know
that he's locked in the western states.
Those states have been locked up for ten years.
Red, red, red and they'll be red again by the end of the night.
It's gonna come down to Pennsylvania and Ohio.
Conway needs both. You only need one.
Matthews?
He'll push back. He might even go public.
What about the other five states in play?
The lawyers are waiting.
We can generate lawsuits, argue suppression, but...
Still not enough.
Olmstead's losing in Ohio, and he's not taking it well.
I spoke with his chief of staff, Tanya, this morning.
He's getting clobbered in the northern part of the state.
Low turnout in Cleveland's not helping.
But he could still pull it out.
He's not going to win and he knows it.
How much time do we have?
Ohio closes in two hours. And most people voted this morning.
Some of these states are baked in already.
Claire and I need the room for a moment.
Yes, sir.
  LeAnn, we'll call you back.   Yes, sir.
Why did you ask him to leave?
Because I just wanted to look in your eyes one more time
before we do this.
Francis...
we're doing this.
He can't save us. He invented term limits.
Doug!
Get me LeAnn Harvey back on the phone.
Yes, sir.
Do what you have to do with Ohio.
I'm on it.
LeAnn, get the lawyers ready.
  I can't do this.   Yes, you can.
  No, no, no, no, no!   And it needs to be done quickly.
It's too sloppy.
Why are you here if LeAnn called me?
Do I really have to explain to you
what will happen if you don't do this?
I don't care if he loses.
I'm not talking about the election. I'm talking about you.
What will happen to you?
You have everything you need. The Pastebin link was sent to you.
Where's LeAnn?
She's not here, and I'm short on time.
Governor, I'm sorry, but there's only one way to play this.
We need you to pull your poll workers
and your machines from those three counties.
The Republicans would crucify me. They own that area.
But those are the precincts
that are most likely to be threatened.
"Likely to be"? Hey, what are you...
What are we talking about here?
Terrorist chatter.
Related to Tennessee?
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm gonna need more than your word on that.
Oh, I'm sorry, but the intelligence is classified, Governor.
Then read me in.
'Cause I'm not doing this
without seeing tangible proof with my own eyes.
You can tell Francis.
The other thing is, with Ohio turnout so low,
people could accuse you of engaging in voter suppression.
What?
The voting centers and the troops were the president's idea.
But you signed on to them,
and that's what matters.
You're losing your election, sir.
The signs are clear.
That'd be a real shame for the Democrats to be down a governor.
But here we have this confluence of events.
Your disappointing returns on one hand
and the chatter on the other.
I need proof. Otherwise, people will think  
That you shut down voting in Republican precincts
to guarantee your own win.
Now I'd say it's a good thing
that the NSA just picked up on some credible chatter.
This dangerous world left you no choice.
Thank you.
Governor, I was just handed the classified intel.
Are you on a secure server?
  Yes, I am.   Please hold.
I'm sending the files over right now.
You're doing the right thing, sir.
We don't want blood on our hands.
I don't care where they're taking the voting machines.
Just stay...
You chain yourself to one of them if you have to.
Good. I'm gonna find an Ohio judge.
Voting centers in Ohio have been closed for almost two hours.
And Conway's got a judge.
He's petitioning to reopen.
But even if they stay closed,
would Ohio get us there?
Other states might be in play.
Rumblings of suppression are out there, although...
Well, what else do we have?
Voter intimidation in Idaho.
What do you think?
Should I call them back and have them file?
I like it.
It has the most resonance with what's happened in Tennessee.
I also like an assemblyman we have in Georgia.
There's a congressman in Maryland.
That's one of the states that didn't request the troops.
But wait. Don't we need something coming from a voter?
There's a voter in Mississippi.
Said she was too scared to vote.
That TV essentially told her not to go.
Well, that sounds like a bit of a stretch.
That could be a plus for us, sir.
Really open things up.
If Ohio stays shut,
there could be a ripple effect.
This is all uncharted territory.
All right, let's put a pin in Georgia and Maryland,
and let's keep the Ohio voting centers shut down,
and see where that gets us.
Pennsylvania has gone to Conway.
Even if Ohio is still too close to call
and the President does well in the Northwest,
he can't counter Conway's gains in the South,
in what would typically be Underwood territory.
The people have spoken.
I can't believe this.
The President apologizes that he couldn't be here tonight,
but he wanted me to let you know that concession is inevitable.
All the states haven't been called yet.
The president still has time if he needs...
Guys, we fought a good fight.
But, unfortunately, this is the reality of the situation.
Jesus.
Well, I guess that's that.
Yeah, this is Will.
I wanted to be the first to tell you
congratulations, Mr. President-elect.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
What? You think I learned nothing from Al Gore?
We kept them on the edge of their seats, didn't we?
I guess that means the system is working.
I guess it does.
You're about as tough an opponent as they come, Francis.
Well, I've had a lot of practice.
Now, you be sure to give my regards to Hannah and the children.
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm...
sure I'll be calling on you for advice in the very near future.
Well, I look forward to that.
He conceded?
Yeah.
We did it.
We did it.
Excuse me, sir.
General Brockhart is on his way over to the suite.
Thank you.
Sources are telling us that Francis Underwood
conceded to Governor Conway on the phone
only a short time ago.
I suspect their numbers are matching up with ours,
which would put Ohio in the Republican column.
Enough to make William Conway
the next president of the United States.
  Hello?   Tanya, put him on the line.
Hang on, let me see if I can get him.
He's my Secretary of State,
and he has the power to do it.
Well, then you need to tell him what to do.
He says he can reopen and extend the voting day into tomorrow.
Tell him it's not safe.
I've done that, Doug!
Obviously, he doesn't seem to care.
Underwood conceded already.
Do not trot out your Secretary of State.
Voting cannot resume.
Now, if you have any doubt,
you swallow it right now.
I'm worried about the party.
What this could do to the party.
Roger, this is so much bigger than the party.
I feel like I'm risking my entire career here.
You are.
And if you don't do what I'm telling you,
it's over for sure.
What?
How many hours is it gonna take him
to spit out the fucking words in public?
Screw this. Screw protocol.
I'm heading down there.
  No, you're not.   It's already tomorrow, Mark.
I mean, this is insane.
  I want to make my speech!   Ohio is still in play.
What?
What are you talking about?
...fear from continued terrorist threats
and the disturbing news coming out of Tennessee...
I was forced to close a number of our polling places.
Fuck me.
And in accordance with the Ohio secretary of state,
the vote is suspended until further notice.
Now, I know this may put our electorates in question...
...but I had no choice.
New Jersey might not certify.
There's been a variety of irregularities.
Same with Illinois.
Looks like Nevada's making noises, too.
I'm having dj vu. You ever get that?
Are you seriously asking me about dj vu?
Never mind. It's gone.
You never get dj vu? Everybody does.
I don't.
Don't look so worried, Doug.
You just felt familiar for a second.
It's over.
Now, the presidency hangs in the balance.
At least six states will not have certified vote totals
on Election Night .
Good evening.
I guess I should say good morning.
Will wishes he could be here himself...
but we've been advised that goes against protocol.
I know...
you're disappointed.
Are you okay with the word disappointed?
Shouldn't we acknowledge their outrage?
I'd say we should tread lightly.
For now, we're just asking for their patience.
Okay, let's do it.
Never a dull moment in this country.
Will wishes he could be here himself,
but we've been advised that would go against protocol.
I know you're disappointed
that the change you were hoping for...
...that you voted for,
has to wait a little longer.
And, finally, a night of electoral indecision,
with lawsuits being filed in nearly every state,
has ended with the mayor of Honolulu,
in the last state to close its polls,
refusing to honor the results of the election
and filing a lawsuit.
Was Hawaii one of ours?
No, I don't think so.
Claire, could you do me a little favor?
I have a splitting headache.
Could you rub my temples for a moment?
Of course.
No, actually the pain is right behind my eyes.
Could you just... rub my eyes for me?
But you hate that.
I know, but I think I'll like it this time.
You can do it harder.
Even harder than that.
There's no coming back from this.
I know exactly what we're about to do.
If we fail, it's on both of us.
I won't be able to protect you.
And what a relief that will be...
for both of us.
The American people don't know what's best for them.
I do.
I know exactly what they need.
They're like little children, Claire.
Children we never had.
We have to hold their sticky fingers
and wipe their filthy mouths.
Teach them right from wrong.
Tell them what to think
and how to feel and what to want.
They even need help writing their wildest dreams,
crafting their worst fears.
Lucky for them...
they have me...
they have you.
Underwood.
Underwood.
One nation...
Underwood.
Doug, LeAnn... do you have a moment?House.of.Cards.SE
  Not my president!   Not my president!
  Not my president!   Not my president!
  Not my president!   Not my president!
  Not my president!   Not my president!
  Not my president!   Not my president!
The people are angry.
Nine weeks ago, we had an election in this country,
but because two states refused to certify,
neither Conway nor myself received the  electoral votes
required for victory.
So they gather here every morning
to exercise their magnificent right,
guaranteed by the First Amendment...
to let their angry voices be heard.
And so, Thanksgiving, Christmas,
and half of January have come and gone,
and all three branches of government are in crisis.
The Congress is in disarray,
the Supreme Court is down a justice and doomed to deadlock,
and the executive branch is without a boss.
You see, my feeling is,
I think the Founding Fathers, they just got tired.
And really, can you blame them?
I mean, you can't think of everything.
Black swans, Murphy's Law.
I mean, at a certain point,
you just have to sign off and cross your goddamn fingers
and hope for the best.
Or adopt "Flipism,"
a pseudo-philosophy of life in which
the most important decisions are made by the flipping of a coin.
It was first introduced in the Disney comic book
Flip Decision, one of my favorites,
in which Donald Duck is persuaded by Professor Batty
to make all the most important decisions
based on the flipping of a coin.
"Life is but a gamble.
Let flipism guide your ramble."
We've had this sort of trouble before.
The election of , Jefferson versus Burr.
They wound up in a tie.  electoral votes each.
That was the number required then,
and that's when Congress tried to address
what the Founding Fathers just couldn't imagine.
And, poof, the Twelfth Amendment was born.
And it says that if the states don't certify,
it's the House that chooses the president
and the Senate that chooses the vice president.
Now the House is a bit of a mess,
but the Senate is rather democratic in how they choose the VP.
One person, one vote.
But if there's a tie...
and this is where Donald Duck comes in,
it's resolved...
by the toss of a coin.
A solution that's elegant as hell.
But then there's no elegance in modern politics.
It's mostly hell.
The identity of the next President of these United States
is once again in the hands of a bunch of
self-serving, money-hungry,
boot-licking, power-seeking politicians
who can be seduced or sucker punched
or blackmailed into submission.
And all I need is just one more vote than the other guy.
As you can see, the Founding Fathers didn't plan for this.
But I did.
Meet your new daddy.
Right.
You can feel it, right? It's like you're there.
Doesn't that look just like it?
To me, it is that place.
You okay, man?
Yeah. Of course.
It really helps. Very effective.
Yeah. I'd be happy to help you find more funding for it.
If you're feeling a little worked up...
What?
Little worked up?
I was elected President of the United States over two months ago.
But somehow, Congress is now deciding the election.
So forgive me for being a little...
  Will...   ...worked up.
I don't think Tony was implying anything.
Of course. Good.
I'm gonna get myself ready.
I don't want to go to the event looking like this.
Right.
Thanks, Tony.
Romero's chief of staff insists he's not in town.
  And do you believe her?   No.
But she's been in D.C. longer than he has.
At some point she'll take care of herself.
Well, did you tell her I have no interest in discussing
the Declaration of War Committee with him?
I expressed our desire
for a civil and productive meeting with the Congressman.
Well, find him.
If he wants to hide from me,
he can do it to my face.
Yes, sir.
And, Doug.
How many protestors are out there today?
More than yesterday.
But they're doing their best
to divert them away from the White House.
I don't know what's worse...
the sound of their chanting
or the sound of silence when they're not.
I'll get to work, sir.
Good morning, Augustus.
Well, Eric, I...
I'm sorry. They told me to sit, but, uh  
No, no, no. It's perfectly fine. I...
I can't imagine anyone else who would...
well, enjoy this more than you.
You know, I only started it
after you and I met in Spotsylvania.
The attention to detail is... It's just...
It is, yes.
I've got...
I mean, I...
I'm sorry, I'm a... a little overwhelmed by the moment.
It's just...
I have this feeling, as if, uh...
I've imagined this somehow.
I know that sounds, uh...
You've even got the button on his haversack.
Yes.
I think people underestimate...
the importance of detail...
to the overall impact.
Yeah.
The Bloody Angle experts would be very impressed.
When we met in Spotsylvania, how did you know...
so many specific things about Augustus, uh...
about Augustus Underwood's death?
I mean, the very spot where he died?
The... the fact that his skull had been crushed with a rock?
That they buried him in an unmarked grave? I mean...
the detail of all that.
Hope you'll forgive me, uh...
For?
I was meeting Vice President Francis Underwood.
I... thought he deserved a good story.
Wait, wait a minute. You...
  you made all that up?   Well...
I took some liberties.
But, well, I don't know, once it started,
it came to me so clearly...
  It's Eric, yeah?   Yes, sir.
The crowd?
Yes. I'm sorry, what were you about to say?
I don't mean to overstep, sir...
but the people out there...
I don't care what they're saying.
And the way I see it, a person's destiny is, you know...
sealed.
We are in uncharted territory here.
All right. But, Donny, do me a favor, okay?
  Let the Constitution     Can I finish?
Hold on. Just let the Constitution do its job.
Okay, Joe, Joe, I'm gonna finish for once.
You've got voters filing individual suits...
  Right.   ...in Tennessee and Ohio,
and they are jammed up in the Supreme Court.
Like everything else,
the day-to-day workings of this country are on hold.
Okay, they may be on hold, but guess what?
Last time I checked,
everybody was still getting their Social Security checks.
Yeah, but if the debt limit is reached?
Come on. Let me finish now.
Again, it's why we have a Constitution.
I know it looks messy.
Democracy's messy. But guess what?
There is a method to that madness.
I don't know, Joe.
It's more madness than method right now.
I mean, if the government does shut down,
those Social Security checks, they might not go out.
If the government shuts down,
who knows if Congress can even pick a president?
Each state in the House just gets one vote.
So if smaller states like Delaware and Rhode Island
can't reach a consensus...
  Right.   No, it's true.
I mean, if one or two of these
really stubborn members of Congress
decides they're going to hold this up, it could be months.
Look, that's what I'm saying.
The road to  votes is not an easy one.
All right. Strange days indeed, Mika.
So are these the start to short stories?
They're nothing yet. Fragments.
Pieces.
I mean, clearly, this is about me.
This is my mother.
And this is us.
  You can't write     I'm writing.
It's what I do. I'm a writer.
I know you're frustrated, Tom, but  
I wouldn't say frustrated.
Well, it's invasive.
  Write about your own experiences.   This is my experience.
Listen, Tom,
just because we've decided Francis and I need to stay here,
doesn't mean you have to.
So if you have things you need to do,
you should go ahead and do them.
I'll be spending my day convincing the Senate to vote for me,
so there's no speeches necessary.
Yeah, okay.
You know what? I do have some things to do.
Some people I need to check in with. So...
Tom.
Yeah?
Yes?
You ready, Mrs. Underwood?
I'll have a car waiting for you.
So do you want the good news or the bad news first?
Always the bad.
The president's approvals are down to  .
And the good?
They're worse for Congress.
And you're at .
Well, thankfully it's congress we have to convince now,
not the public.
These are the remaining senators we'll target before the vote.
All women, by the way.
The biggest challenges will be
Indiana's freshman senator Susan Newman.
The constitutional lawyer?
And Hawaii's Kerry Kuilima,
who seems to be enjoying
getting to wield a little power for once.
I need to tell you, there is a lot of pushback on the Hill
about the simultaneous vote for president and VP.
The country is terrified it'll lead to a split ticket.
There's threats of a filibuster.
Well, the Dems won the Senate,
and they want to vote when the House does.
That decision's been made.
And the vice president won't allow a filibuster of any kind
onto the floor.
Ma'am, have you contemplated how it could possibly work,
you as vice president to President Conway?
That's not going to happen.
Of course.
I did learn one true thing about Augustus Underwood.
What?
He was dead. Cold.
They put him on a cart...
bunch of dead bodies to bury.
Then, after a full day and night...
he woke up.
What?
Someone stole his shoes and the buttons off his uniform, but...
he lived.
Few days later, he caught up to his regiment.
Really?
I have to get back to the madness.
I hope I get to see you again, Mr. President.
Eric... what do you do when you're not,
reenacting?
I'm an actor.
Sometimes.
I mean, I'd do a lot more if someone would let me.
So, right now, I'm mostly a personal trainer.
  A personal trainer?   Yeah.
You know where to find me.
And, sir...
no matter how dire things look...
you're gonna come out of this alive.
You're an Underwood, after all.
No, don't... don't "Chief-of-staff" me, Eleanor.
No, don't give me his schedule.
I don't want to hear about
how Congressman Romero is meeting with his constituents
or stuck on an Acela train.
You know, it's Fazio, right?
The pronunciation?
Eleanor Fazio?
I... I just want to be sure.
Because when the president wins, and he is going to win,
I will remember your name.
I still need you to review this release.
Now, obviously, the goal is
to combat the "hiding out" narrative,
emphasizing the work that they're doing.
  Is it a personal matter?   Business.
It's always business.
I'll e-mail you my sign off.
Wait a second.
I need an update on their schedule for tomorrow.
  We're almost there.   I want to know how you found out.
If he needs help,
that can happen after he makes it to the White House.
Mark, you're not answering my question.
If word of treatment,
any kind of treatment, got out  
His friend was showing him the therapy. That's it.
  Please don't insult me.   Who do you think you are?
Inserting yourself into every aspect of our lives.
Your husband's campaign needed help.
  Help arrived.   Yes, but  
Help that you, most of all, pushed for. Yes?
  Who told you about the VR therapy?   He did.
Let's go.
What's going on?
I was just telling Mark how much I miss having Marshall around.
Well, he's still around.
Where are you going?
I forgot my bag.
It's right here.
Hello. Yeah.
Yes, sir, he's right here.
It's him.
Congressman.
You have no idea how bad this could get.
We don't wanna be late.
Well, I couldn't agree more.
She might have gone to Santa Fe.
You don't believe me, do you?
I would need to see something, Lisa. Something concrete.
I have a photo. I have one, but...
Listen.
Look at me.
You're not the first person to come here making false claims
about Underwood and his cronies.
But I'm telling the truth.
Everything you're saying you could've read in the paper.
That's how I realized who he was. His picture in the paper.
Which makes your story harder to prove. We're talking in circles.
What about Doug Stamper driving me home when my car broke down,
telling me his name was Peter and that he sold insurance?
  No one can corroborate that story.   Rachel!
Rachel could.
  You should finish that.   I'm not hungry.
Maybe I am. I don't know.
I want to thank you for reaching out.
I am not saying I don't believe you.
But there's already enough evidence out there
to take the president down.
And now, with this election, he'll be accountable for even more.
  I'm certain of it.   I don't care.
I don't care about Underwood. I want you to talk to Doug Stamper.
I want you to find out what happened to my...
Whatever, forget it.
  Uh. Hold on.   Thanks for the sandwich.
All right. Hold on.
There's a story that I love about LBJ.
Uh, it was back in ' or '.
A congressman was ducking him... and he came back to his office
to find the president sitting in his chair...
waiting for him.
The president expects to see you within the hour.
Miss Fazio can give you the specifics.
  He was wearing his cowboy hat.   What?
President Johnson. You left out the best part of the story.
We closed the place down last night. Thanks for the invite.
Bunch of us are headed back to the same spot tonight,
if you wanna come.
Cool. Uh, he has a late lunch today. Won't be back till :.
  Oh, I just needed to drop this for him.   Sure.
Next time, just ask.
See you tonight.
You gambled and you lost.
Actually, my bloc gained seats more than eight weeks ago.
Which I suspect is why I'm here.
Don't overestimate your position.
Or underestimate mine.
You still haven't been elected president, sir.
Yeah, but the presidency won't matter
once the party turns its back on you, will it?
When Bob Birch puts all the rest of your sheep in line,
you'll be begging to come in from the cold.
And two years from now, you'll be back in Phoenix
replaying this very moment over and over again in your mind
and realizing it was the beginning of the end.
Patricia Whittaker and the Democratic Party
will wipe their hands of you.
  I'm loyal to the party.   As you should be.
As you should say.
But really...
what's your leverage?
The committee? That's done.
You see, you've already put out, Alex,
and Will Conway is not taking you to the prom.
My conversations with the governor
and any position that I may or may not have  
Oh, listen to yourself. Do you even believe you?
You are awfully confident
for someone who's already lost the election once.
Do me a favor. Forget the presidency for just a moment.
You don't have... the capital
to build on the congressional revolution that you've started,
politically or otherwise.
Our movement wants to explode things  
Oh, please. Spare me your progressive PR bullshit.
You want what they all want.
Access. A better seat at the table.
Your name before the rest.
And that is something that I can give you.
And how many votes do you want in exchange?
Just three from your ever-growing bloc
would assure me the win in key delegations.
Specifically?
Maine, Wisconsin and New Hampshire are still in play.
All three?
I believe in you, Congressman. Do you wanna know why?
Tell me.
Because I trust ambition.
  So this is a straight-up bribe.   Oh, no, Congressman.
A bribe is something you can refuse.
Now, since you haven't been around the block as many times as I have,
let me walk you through how this works.
Excuse me, Mr. President, but I do know how this is done.
Oh, well, that's good to hear.
I'll start with Maine. She owes me.
You know, we did meet once before, Mr. President.
At a dinner, during the  convention.
  I tried to introduce myself to you...   And?
  You don't remember, do you?   Why would I?
Why is the moderator so interested in Brockhart's opinion?
Has everyone suddenly forgotten now I'm at the top of the ticket?
No, of course not.
Are we done here?
Yeah. We should talk about tomorrow's schedule.
Uh, vote's looking good now.
We still need to talk to as many congressmen as we can.
Well, you figure it out and give us a call.
And, uh, enough with the events targeting the Armed Services.
We got as many Congress people as we could get out of this.
No offense, General, but we need to divide and conquer. Okay?
Will, I was speaking with Mark...
  Yeah.   ...and I want you to know,
if you need to talk about anything, I'm available.
The only support I need, General...
is that of a vice president to his president. Okay?
Senator Talbert's priorities are affordable housing
and closing corporate tax loopholes.
And access to higher education especially.
The call is in ten.
Why did Aidan Macallan run away?
What?
Why did Macallan run away?
I wish I could tell you.
Clock's ticking.
Yes, give me Tom Yates' driver's number, please.
Yes.
Yes, ma'am.
New York.
You drove all the way to New York?
Where?
Who's he with?
I don't know. A woman. Older.
I don't know how that'll work, ma'am.
Yes. Yes, I'll try.
No, I understand your concern, Senator.
Student loan reform is a priority for you,
so it will be a priority for the president and me.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Well, Louise, you as a pillar of the party,
it will be much appreciated if I can get your help tomorrow.
And it'll just be you and me and a couple of your...
female colleagues in the Senate.
Okay, well, I look forward to a productive dialogue.
  Better late than never.   Sorry I missed dinner.
Why the back?
I'm pretending you're an Uber. Just help me out.
My sister-in-law. She came when you couldn't.
Do you think the dead judge us?
No.
What did he do that you liked the most?
Here... in bed.
Sitting up was the best.
Legs around each other.
He'd run his right hand
up the back of my neck into my hair and pull it.
My hair and my head back...
And?
And with the other hand, he'd pull me in and out.
Always looking at me.
Seeing me.
You want me to do that?
Yeah.
It's so nice in here. You can hardly hear them.
Oh, trust me, I can hear them.
With New Hampshire, it's what?
Twenty-four. With Maine, .
  Twenty-six if we get Wisconsin.   Where's Tom?
He needed to get some air.
  Wisconsin is being stubborn.   Then who else?
Iowa, maybe Colorado, , .
How was your great-great-great-grandfather Augustus?
He goes by Eric.
Eric.
He admired my craftsmanship.
  We should make a play for North Dakota.   Agreed.
In the Senate, I think you can swing some votes from Missouri.
Did you ask LeAnn about Macallan?
She didn't know anything. I believe her.
We have to quit again.
Otherwise, they'll kill us.
No Macallan. He was there, though. Left his belongings.
Anything from the National Police?
No. CIA's man in the palace
isn't even sure he's still in Jakarta.
They'll find him, LeAnn. That's all I can give you.
I appreciate your help.
Kerry, Susan, what can I get you?
  I'm fine, thanks.   I'm good with water.
  What about you, Louise?   What are you having?
  Splash of vodka on ice.   Make it two.
Susan and I were talking on the way over, Claire.
This election mess has left us
all facing some scary possibilities.
  Conway wins in the House     Which is far from inevitable.
But if a split ticket were to happen...
it would be bad for this country.
No, Conway is what would be bad for this country.
Let's hope the House does the right thing.
But as far as the Senate,
I am very grateful that we have Donald Blythe steering that ship.
Mrs. Underwood, I'm sorry to say this,
but no matter what you're offering here,
I can't support the president.
And, by extension, I can't support you.
It's not you, Claire. It's him.
Susan and I are on the same page about this.
What if this isn't about Francis Underwood, huh?
It's Claire Underwood who has the promising future.
I want a woman in the White House.
And if she has to start as a vice president, fine.
But it's time.
  It's time.  I hear that, Louise,
but I'll say it...
A vote for you is a vote for Frank Underwood.
Listen, I understand your concerns about Francis' record. I do.
If Conway wins,
wouldn't you want a Democrat to keep him in check?
And what if a vote for me isn't necessarily a vote for Francis?
Twenty-one promised for you, sir.
Twenty-three for Conway.
Two deadlocked. Four unknown.
But I think things will shift once they caucus.
  All right, let's bring him in.   Yes, sir.
  Have a seat.   I won't be long.
Well, then, stand like a man
who doesn't know whether to sit or not.
Congressman Romero, do you have good news for me?
Have your progressives seen the light?
I did what I could, Mr. President. I couldn't sway the bloc.
Couldn't... or wouldn't?
Maine and New Hampshire are noncommittal.
Congressman Wolcott is turning Wisconsin for Conway.
Tell me a different truth.
They aren't listening to me.
They believe supporting you would do more damage
to the Democratic Party and the country than a Conway presidency.
Well, I am sorry that it has come to this.
As am I. I'm sure we'll meet again, sir.
Yes, but before you go, just take a look around this room.
Study every detail, every aspect.
Because this is the last time you will ever step foot in here.
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
And to think you could have made yourself memorable
in so many other ways.
I'll make sure he never sees another committee, sir.
Oh, no. He wants us to put up a fight, make him feel bigger.
He's just read some polls and thinks I'm in trouble.
That's why he's coming after me.
All right, we have  hours.
I have to work Colorado and shore up Tennessee.
But Maine, Wisconsin and New hampshire
must be turned by any means necessary.
All caucusing will end by noon on Thursday,
and then the vote in both
.
Well... I don't make the decisions, Chuck. I just relay them.
No. No, there will not be a statement at this time.
Well, because there's nothing to state until after the vote.
Close the door.
Right. Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, please don't make me say yes again.
Crazy days in these United States.
So you wanna tell me what was so important
I had to get you through the gates?
Girl named Lisa Williams came in.
Says she was Rachel Posner's girlfriend.
Said Doug Stamper knew Rachel.
Feels like maybe he was involved in her disappearance.
And she said the words "Doug Stamper"?
Rachel Posner went missing around the time
Stamper was carjacked and had his head bashed in.
And this Lisa thinks...
Well, she's not sure exactly.
Well, can she prove a connection?
It's all instinct at this point.
Come on.
You want a tour of the White House,
you could just straight up ask me for one.
  Hammerschmidt.   Is he making anything of it?
Not yet. But the information about her is on the top of his desk.
Lisa Williams.
Mr. Grayson, you have a call on line three.
Well, I gotta get back to it.
If Tom follows up on her, let me know.
  Thanks for the pass.   It's temporary.
Okay.
  LeAnn Harvey.   Always burning the midnight oil.
  Aidan?   You ready to join me?
Do you have any idea how much jeopardy you have put me in?
You should've gotten out when you had the chance.
You think you're out?
  Listen, I need you to do me a favor.   Where are you?
Get the FBI, CIA,
and whoever else is looking for me to stop, now.
Okay, Aidan, you know, just...
come back here, and we will figure this out together.
If they keep coming after me,
I will start leaking things about the Underwoods.
You don't wanna do that.
You have no idea who you're working for, LeAnn.
God damn it.
You have an update for the president?
I've been juggling senators most of the day.
And your congressman from Maine?
Is still my friend's father and is still too busy to meet.
So was Wisconsin and New Hampshire,
until I forced them to.
You have your style, I have mine.
The president doesn't care about style, LeAnn.
Just get the congressman by the vote on Thursday.
Will just walked in.
Yeah.
Okay.
Talk soon. Bye.
  That your mom?   Yeah. She sends her best.
Yeah.
  Where's Charlie?   In the living room.
Lily's playing in the den.
  Where are you going?   I should change.
  You keep walking away from me, Hannah.   Oh, please.
Why would you invite him here?
Now?
He's a friend. He's your friend.
And I thought maybe...
it'd be something that you'd be interested in looking at.
I'm doing all I can.
  All you can?   Yes.
Like doubt me?
Like think that you know better what's in my mind than I do?
You know, you're the one who told Mark.
I had to deny I had anything to do with it.
See, these people, Hannah... Usher and Marshall...
they're hired hands. They can't be trusted.
And Brockhart, he's in it for himself.
But... but you, my darling, my love  
  Stop it.   Stop what?
What are you gonna do? Take the kids and go to your mom?
As if you would.
You already picked out the White House china.
You want this more than anything. To be president.
Don't you dare judge me now that I want it, too.
Yes, Congressman, but flights are considered bribes.
Yes, Congressman, it's not your DUIs that concern us,
it's your daughter's.
Well, you should've done a better job hiding the payouts.
I mean, really.
Yes, I'm sure you are... but how old was he again?
Yes, and he was in the choir, is that right?
But you can never erase an e-mail,
even my dead aunt knows that.
Well, get back to me as soon as you can.
  So?   Maine finally looks solid, sir.
New Hampshire doesn't, though.
I've been sitting in here for hours
busting my ass, getting some results.
We should have secured New Hampshire.
How did LeAnn get Maine?
She cashed in a favor.
Well, why couldn't you do the same goddamn thing?
It doesn't make sense.
I thought I had him. I mean...
And it's not just New Hampshire. Wisconsin should've folded.
Should have?
What's going on, Doug? What's happening?
Is there some issue with your commitment? Your loyalty?
What?
Perhaps you just aren't worthy of my trust.
I have given everything to you.
Almost the entirety of my professional life, Frank.
You watch your tone.
The things I've done...
The things that I have done to help keep you here,
and you're gonna question my loyalty?
Well, if we can't win,
we have to make sure that Conway doesn't either.
Maine coming over only means he won't get to .
A deadlock isn't a win. But at least...
I'm sorry, Doug. I was out of line.
Let's get back to work.
It's not just what he did with all the data.
Aidan had access to everything.
We need to get the CIA and FBI off his trail,
and I need your help.
You're causing problems, LeAnn,
which is the last thing that we can afford right now.
Macallan sealed his own fate.
I delivered Maine, Doug,
which is more than you can say about New Hampshire.
I'll owe you.
Not enough.
Has the president spoken to you about Aidan at all?
No.
Is he on a kill list?
The United States of America doesn't have kill lists, LeAnn.
I am the only thing preventing Mac from releasing what he has.
And my guess is, whatever it is, it'll implicate you, too.
Am I wrong, Doug?
Someone close to Senator Mitchell woke me up with the news.
Get me the vice president on the phone.
That is not going to help.
Well, how do you intend on dealing with it?
Donald.
  Don't do it.   Claire  
I know what you and Senator Mitchell were planning.
Do what you were supposed to do.
Move the anti-filibuster measure forward so the Senate can vote
  and elect me vice president.   No.
  No?   All voices should be heard
out of respect for the American people
and the gravity of the vote before the Senate today,
the first like this since .
The House is about to vote, Donald. What is going on?
Let's get this done so you can go home.
It looks like Conway is going to win.
And no matter what people have told you,
the Senate is voting for Brockhart.
  It's country over party, Claire.   Are you flexing?
I'm stalling until the House vote happens
and then the Senate votes accordingly.
You'd do that to the party
to which you've devoted your entire career?
The country needs clarity and resolution.
That's the most important thing.
There'll be another election in four years.
But look...
I saw you when Francis was in the coma.
What you're capable of when given the opportunity.
You still have a shot down the road. I'd vote for you.
Whatever you think, I know I have the numbers.
I don't think so.
But come on.
You're not like him. Be patient.
You're a fool, Donald. You always were.
You and your dumb, dead wife that you never, ever shut up about.
Principled? Idealistic?
A champion for the people? What did you ever actually do?
Nothing.
The great crusader? I don't think so.
You just liked the position of the bumbling idiot that you are.
The optimist. The idealist.
You loved it so much that you couldn't even make a deal
or move a single thing forward.
You have a legacy of nothing.
Sign the measure, get the Republicans off the floor,
start the vote now.
Do you know what I just realized?
Your initials...
they're missing an "N" and a "T".
The vote is inconclusive, Mr. President.
Neither you nor Conway to .
Still alive. What about Claire?
This is impossible.
I'm as surprised as you are.
Maine. There was no heads-up on that.
Look, I know this is frustrating. It should be over.
I... I'm the president.
I don't care what they say, I...
I'm fucking President of the United States.
No, you're not.
The vice president will be acting president
for as long as it takes the House to decide.
I should make some calls.House.of.Cards.SE
I, Claire Hale Underwood,
do solemnly swear
that I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States...
I'm proud of her. She deserves this.
Even if it only lasts for a couple of weeks.
And will, to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect, and defend
the Constitution of the United States, so help me God.
Congratulations, Madam Acting President.
  Feel different?   No.
  Liar.   It's temporary. I'm only acting.
You have to now carry this with you at all times.
  The codes?   Mmm  hmm. It's the law.
Governor, we just got word
that Vice President Claire Underwood
was sworn in as acting president.
Were you aware?
Of course.
Do you have any comment?
God bless America.
If Monday's House vote goes your way,
  and you win the presidency...   Oh, I'll win, believe me.
You think this vote will be the charm?
See, Congress is no different than the rest of the country.
People are sick and tired of all this confusion and chaos.
The public is not happy.
If you become president,
would Claire Underwood remain as vice president?
Not if she wants what's best for the country.
But given the Twelfth Amendment, would you have a choice?
Uh, no further questions, everybody.
The governor's here to talk to members of Congress.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you. Thanks, everybody.
  Will?   I'm fine.
And Rasmussen changed his vote.
Well, he's been waiting a long time to pay me back.
Creating a deadlock in Rhode Island just gives him the spotlight.
  He can be convinced.   Meeting's set for this afternoon.
Yes, but if we can't, we lose Rhode Island.
He seems to be acting alone, but that could change.
We will make gains this weekend.
Shore things up by Monday's vote.
Mr. President,
it's possible we may need to consider the other option.
A rescheduled election.
No, no, I'll get Rasmussen back in line,
and turn some others along the way.
We've arranged sit-downs for you and Madam President
with all of the small states.
LeAnn and I can go door-to-door in Rayburn,
Longworth and Cannon.
Three of my favorite buildings after this one.
What is it?
The McMurdo Research Facility in Antarctica.
All live feed communications have ceased or been disconnected.
However, we have been receiving texts and e-mails
from an American scientist stationed there,
claiming that an unidentified
occupying military force has landed.
You think the soldiers are Russian?
He thinks so.
They arrived via unmarked research vessels.
We reached out to Moscow,
but they're denying any official involvement.
Surprise, surprise.
It's a brazen act of aggression.
Well, it's a crime of opportunity.
Petrov thinks the US government has their eye off the ball.
Well, it doesn't.
Cathy, what's the most recent communication we've received?
What I'm saying is this aggression in Antarctica,
by powers unknown,
is a direct result of the uncertainty
that our presidential situation has wrought.
Congressman Watts, since when is Antarctica a concern
for the Congressional Black Caucus?
I hope you're not implying that the caucus
shouldn't have a voice in international affairs.
I hope that's not what I'm hearing. Thank you, Randy.
I've called a meeting tomorrow,
for the Congressional Black Caucus, to discuss our positions,
both foreign and domestic, before Monday's presidential vote.
Are you considering shifting your support to Conway?
Well, all I can say at this time,
that the most important thing is unity...
and the public's faith in the institution of democracy.
That's all for now.
You are in violation of the Antarctic Treaty System.
A treaty the USSR signed in .
We're a new country.
So you're admitting they are your troops.
I'm simply stating I need to
interpret agreements signed by the Soviet Union.
In which case,
you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress.
The Cold War is over, Mrs. Acting President.
Well, then maybe we need to revisit the treaty.
I'm not interested in revisiting a treaty.
I'm interested in staying in power.
And, Claire...
if I could be so familiar.
In my country...
once you're in office, you don't let go.
  Viktor.   Mr. President.
You Americans certainly have a lot of presidents these days.
Yes, you may think that we're distracted,
but don't fool yourself.
Distracted? No. No, no.
Divided, yes.
American democracy is stronger than your
sad attempt to take advantage of a bump in the road.
Oh, Francis, my eyes are on a landscape
that is so much bigger than any one of your roads.
Well, Congressman Rasmussen,
we're just surprised to see you come out
on the wrong end of this, is all.
I mean, I suppose it must've been hard
losing the House majority leadership
all those years ago,
but there is a difference
between being bitter and being treasonous.
If it's new committee assignments you'd like,
we can certainly arrange that.
It's over.
Markets are in free fall.
Consumer confidence is at an all-time low.
What is this? A doodad? A doohickey?
A... pointless award?
Did I mention I hate useless things?
This nation is coming apart at the seams.
Because of you, because of what you've done to this country.
There it is.
How the righteous love to bemoan their role in middle management,
and condemn those who actually might have an effect on the world.
  Think of the party, Congressman.   I am.
What did you think would happen when you came in here, Francis?
That you could threaten me,
tell me the DNC'll throw money at my primary opponent next cycle
if I don't play ball?
Or were you gonna flatter me?
"Elder of the party" this,
"bellwether senior member" that.
You know, I'm somewhat delighted
that you developed a personality at this late date.
But I would ask you to rethink this.
To come out this way on this thing in the twilight of your career
will do nothing but sully your Wikipedia page.
You have no idea, do you?
No one hears you walking the halls of this building...
not anymore.
  Who are you working for?   Excuse me?
I served next to your jellied spine for two decades.
You've never shown an ounce of courage.
You don't have what it takes for revenge.
So someone must have offered you something rather sweet.
Take all of the two hours you need to reconsider.
One more thing for your signature.
  You can leave this with me.   Of course.
  And Miss Harvey's waiting.   Oh, please send her in.
I'm on my way back to Rayburn.
You close the door, please?
What are our chances with a revote?
Or, rather, what are the president's chances?
I want to know.
If it was in all  states, not good.
His unfavorables are still high. Yours are still not.
But it's hard to argue with close to  years' experience.
Maybe the president is right.
Maybe he does have a better chance in the House.
Don't defer, LeAnn. Tell me what you think.
The revote in Tennessee and Ohio is his best shot.
While it's what's best for Frank,
it may not be what's best for you.
Thank you.
You seem like a reasonable man.
I know how to listen, if that's what you mean.
If the president regains his office  
"If" doesn't make for a winning opener, Alex.
I'm here because I think he can win.
We often don't see eye to eye, he and I.
And yet, there are ways we can work together.
Okay, maybe I made a mistake with the committee.
I can be self-righteous.
I'm trying to clean up the party. Our party.
And I end up speaking out of turn.
It's enough with the, "It's me, not you."
What can you deliver, Alex?
I can get out of the way.
Well, that sounds vague and inadequate.
I want to know what's up with Terry Womack and the Black Caucus.
The president and Congressman Womack,
they have a good relationship.
I'm sure they do. But I would hate to see Terry let you down.
If we lose Womack and the Black Caucus, we're done on Monday.
There are a few freshmen I could reach out to.
They might help keep the CBC together.
You wanna be minority whip.
Only if I deserve to be.
I'm trying to get back.
Congressman Lewis is  minutes late as usual.
Is there a spot for him on financial services?
Doug, stay where you are.
I thought you said you were telling the CIA to stand down.
I did.
So, contrary to your assurances that Macallan would behave,
we're now dealing with a leak.
  He doesn't want trouble.   How do you know what he wants?
You find him and you get him here.
As soon as he knows we've backed off,
he will disappear. I promise.
No, that word means nothing to me.
You have a statement?
You anticipate any other big WikiLeaks info dumps
coming down the pike?
  You'll know     When I need to know.
I know.
Which is apparently whenever it hits CNN.
FBI was on high alert. They investigated every threat.
Calm down.
I am calm, Doug. The public's not calm.
Every misstep is highlighted and heightened.
They wanna know what happened with their election.
We're fixing it.
That's what they're afraid of.
The statement's about the FBI. Everybody trusts the FBI.
Hey, who's Lisa Williams?
I don't know. Why?
Somebody from the Herald called.
They were just wondering if you knew her.
I don't.
I need five minutes with this.
  Open or closed?   Closed.
Am I good with that statement?
I marked it up. It's on my desk.
Throwing the election back to the states,
it gives us less certainty.
I don't think we can get it done by Monday.
We've been working at it for weeks, Francis.
Claire, don't let the office make you careful.
The halls of Congress have never failed me.
Yes, but the career politicians,
they are more entrenched than ever.
There's a new House, with members you don't know.
We need to move the playing
field back to the imaginations of the people.
You have that much faith in the voters in Tennessee and Ohio?
They're going to choose you. I just know it.
All right.
Set up a meeting. I'll hear them all out. You win.
Both of us. Both of us.
Good evening.
Eric.
Feel like you're outside?
Aren't you supposed to limit it to  minutes?
  Oh, God, Jesus, no.   Not if you calibrate the workout.
Oh, I'm feeling fine.
It's all about listening to your body.
It'll tell you when it's time to rest.
You should listen to the doctors some of the time, Francis.
I know the Underwoods were worried.
Because they were ready to deal.
To deal with me.
  You're sure it's for real?   Sure as I can be.
Okay, we'll be in touch.
Okay.
So call him back.
Making progress on a couple of Dems.
Think Congressman Alspaugh is about to turn.
We'll see him on Sunday.
Why wait?
We need to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus. Tomorrow.
They're in Underwood's pocket.
Yeah. Can you give us a second, everybody?
Uh, sure.
Come on.
Thank you.
I just got word from somebody inside.
Womack is losing control of the caucus.
If you win them, you win Monday.
We should try.
All right, fine. Let's do it.
  I'll set it up.   Are we done here tonight?
You still have a few calls.
Mark, I was thinking, maybe we could, um...
cancel tomorrow night in Philadelphia.
We can't cancel any trip, or any event. We shouldn't.
A second to catch our breath would be really helpful, I think.
This is what it is, Hannah. If you need to take a break, you can.
Darling, we haven't slept all week.
You're exhausted.
  I... Just an idea.   What's my next call?
But you're not enjoying yourself.
Because he won't listen to me.
He can't win in the House.
I'm not talking about him. I'm talking about you.
What difference does it make whether I'm enjoying myself or not?
Isn't that what this is all about?
Can't you just... live in it for a second?
You are in charge.
  Yes, but     Come here.
Come.
You could wake up tomorrow...
and...
I don't know, feed the children...
start a war...
You know what? I'm sorry.
I shouldn't think out loud, that's all.
No, you're right.
Let's not talk about anything that happens outside of this room.
The sanctions are meant to target the oligarch class in Russia.
And the more members we have on board
before I sit down with President Petrov,
the quicker this will resolve itself.
We are. We are prepared to release some of our strategic reserves
to keep prices down.
Contact Ambassador Caspi and buy me  more minutes.
Uh, please don't think of this as a deal with the Underwoods.
To be frank, they could be gone by Monday.
That's not what I wish, of course.
But know that you are
working more with me on this than with them.
Congressman Watts.
Governor, we're so happy you could join us today.
As am I. The black community deserves so much better
than Frank Underwood's failed policies.
That we can agree on.
I look forward to hearing about your platform.
  Shall we?   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
We have just a bit more private caucus business
to attend to first.
Excuse me?
This is a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Well, I understand. That's... why we're here.
, and it's already been an hour.
.
And you will get your opportunity to address us.
I appreciate your patience.
I'm not gonna beg.
No, you're gonna smile.
The Muhammed Kalabi they arrested in Tennessee
is not the Kalabi connected to ICO.
Can you prove it wasn't just a bureaucratic mix-up?
Uh, not yet.
What else?
Uh, final voter suppression lawsuit
was kicked back to the lower court,
SCOTUS deadlock is feeding the chaos.
Do you read the paper, Sean?
Billy got a byline on that three days ago.
Declaration of war?
Underwood was so evangelical,
but hasn't mentioned it in weeks.
All right, that's enough. That's enough.
Lisa Williams.
What about Lisa Williams?
I saw you talking.
I thought she might be a lead worth pursuing.
She's not.
She's using what she read in the paper
to get attention or a little cash.
I did some digging.
She and Rachel Posner
both went to a church called the Fellowship.
  Rachel disappeared     Stop.
No more conspiracy theories about dead girls.
But people love stories about dead girls.
The next House vote is the day after tomorrow.
The natives are restless, outraged,
just plain scared, actually.
They want to wake up in the America that they fell asleep in.
Dig deeper on the Kalabi lead.
See if you can connect Underwood to it.
So, this is the James S. Brady press briefing room.
And under our feet is actually a swimming pool.
It was built by the March of Dimes
for President Franklin Roosevelt,
who had polio.
And this pool was really the only way for him to exercise.
It was, an open secret
that the president used a wheelchair most of the time.
Which is why the White House
was one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings.
  But everyone pretended he could walk?   Yes.
  That's a bit of grace.   Yeah.
A thing not spoken?
Yeah, this building literally changed because of his disability.
But people just respected him,
respected his, uh  
Right.
That office used to carry so much weight,
so much, respect.
You don't think it does anymore?
No, oh, no, no! I'm not saying that.
I was giving you a hard time. I know what you meant.
Anyway, sorry, didn't mean to hijack the tour.
Moving on...
Gentlemen, we're ready for you now.
I could come here today
and talk about federal sentencing disparities
between crack and cocaine,
which obviously are racially motivated.
I'm sorry, but are you asserting that the crack epidemic
is exclusive to the black community?
No, not at all.
But I think it's fair to say that sentencing discrepancies
have disproportionately affected minority populations.
We're not one-issue voters.
Of course not. That's what I'm getting at.
The whole point of today's meeting is to broaden our platform.
Republicans are always dwelling on crime, Governor.
Well, I'm here to have a dialogue.
We expected you to come in here with a plan.
And I do have a plan.
Concentrating on a few pieces of onerous legislation is not a plan.
Let's be clear...
That kind of talk we've heard before.
  I'm a Republican.   Here we go.
You're not listening.
Look, I want to help you help yourselves.
Unbelievable.
That's my platform.
Well... I've heard enough.
So, does anyone else have any questions for the governor?
Well, I have a question.
What has Francis Underwood ever done for you?
This little charade this morning...
  Well done. Quite an act.   Will.
  Governor.   No, but really.
See, you may have differences with me...
You may have genuine differences with me.
But see, that's the operative word, "genuine."
Can someone here please explain to me
why you all are still so loyal
to Francis Underwood and the Democrats?
One of these days
the members of this room will realize
how much you actually prop up the status quo.
And how's that working for ya?
Will, why don't we thank the gentlemen and women for their time?
You've made a mistake.
What we're proposing is a new election in the two states
that weren't able to provide valid electors
by the safe harbor date.
Can we even do this?
Hold on. Hold on, everyone!
I'd like to know,
where does the attorney general stand on this?
Looking into it, but on board.
Bob, there's no precedent here.
There's no playbook.
We can look to the Constitution for inspiration,
but not for instruction.
Thursday's vote showed Democrats are coming to their senses.
We lost one vote, Jordan.
We can go back and forth like this forever.
As one of the few Republicans in the room, it needs to be said.
The stability of our country
is more important than the presidency.
Not if people believe the president
is being chosen behind closed doors.
A process that is laid out in the Constitution.
The same process that can keep us gridlocked
for the next two years.
The House should and will decide.
Delaware has one congressman.
How will that play in Austin when your opponent in two years
tells voters that you allowed a state like Delaware
to have the same influence as Texas?
A lot of you incumbents will be in danger of losing your seats.
And there it is.
Look. Look at them.
That is the look of contemplating loss.
Loss...
the only constituent that anyone in this room really listens to.
I, for one, would like to hear
how the president feels about all this.
  Well, I've made my...   I think we could...
No, Mr. President. You haven't spoken much here.
We believe in one person, one vote.
If we take that away, then what is this country?
Isn't that right, Mr. President?
Absolutely, Madam President.
Wait, hold it. Let me just move down a bit.
I keep slipping off the podium.
  You got me.   That better?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
So the Lincoln...
That was actually his office?
Can we... can we not?
  Can you... can you move me up a bit?   Yeah.
Okay.
  How'd it go?   We'll see.
I need you to look over the Antarctica statement again.
Whatever you need.
Walk with me?
I'm worried about Francis.
  Why?   I might need you to save me.
  This is not going to work.   Why?
If he loses, I still lose.
He cannot be on the outside looking in.
He'll win.
You actually believe that?
Sure... why not?
It was a wager.
The potential gains made it necessary.
It was a complete waste of my time.
If you don't start turning things around,
you're going to be out on your fucking ass. You understand?
I do.
I should explain something to you, Governor.
If you ever talk to me like that again...
I'll make sure you never win another election in your life.
  Are you threatening me?   No, I'm enlightening you.
Governor Conway. Hello, sir.
How you doin'? Take a peek,
  if you don't mind, Captain?   Governor.
I used to fly, too, you know.
What kinda max thrust you get on these engines?
  About , pounds.   , pounds.
I used to fly something a lot bigger, a lot more power,
but it was so weighed down with all the weaponry,
it was like flying a tank.
Why don't you let me in for a second,
just flip me the controls?
I'm sorry, sir. I can't.
Come on, I...
I just want to feel the weight on the stick for a second.
I wish I could, but, uh, you're not on the flight plan.
You know I've been in situations,
where, like, I've been shot at.
You realize that, right?
You don't think I can handle a twin engine at , feet,
straight and level over some farm country?
I mean, come on, sir.
Sir.
You should probably go back to the main cabin.
You know I'm gonna be the president, right?
  I hope so, sir.   You hope so?
I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.
I'm gonna be the president,
and you're going to flip me those motherfucking controls.
Will, come on.
  What? What do you want?   I just
I need to talk to you for a minute, please.
I was just talking to the pilots.
Okay, I need you to calm down, okay?
Breathe.
Will, why don't you sit down?
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
I'll fire you.
I'll leave you on the goddamn tarmac.
Okay.
What the fuck are you gonna do?
Sit down and try and act like an adult...
or at least like the next President of the United States.
Sit.
Who are they?
Maybe Indonesian secret police?
What if we don't pay?
Are there other buyers?
I don't know.
I'll take care of it.
  How?   Don't ask how.
I'll get Macallan back.
Obviously, this stays between us.
Say, "Thank you, Doug."
Thank you, Doug.
We met on a bus.
She was listening to music.
And I asked her to go to this church I used to go to.
  Where was that?   Maryland.
The Winter's Run Fellowship.
About an hour north of Baltimore.
So, then what?
I don't know. We just...
became friends. And then it became more than that.
Started spending every night together.
At some point, she told me about this guy
who used to come around to check on her.
  What'd he look like?   I never saw him.
Just sometimes she said he was coming,
so she couldn't hang out.
She wouldn't really tell me anything about him.
Everything okay?
Yeah, do you mind?
I just need to see my friend up there.
How are you doing?
Thanks.
You think there's oil there.
You're positioning to stake a claim.
There are no Russian troops in Antarctica.
We're willing to recommend changes
to the Antarctic Treaty parties.
What happens to you when the Underwoods are ejected from office?
You teach international relations at a university?
Or work for a think tank?
I haven't thought that far ahead.
I think you have.
How long do you expect the world to believe
those aren't your soldiers?
Do you like working for the Underwoods?
How loyal are you?
When the time comes, will you stand with them...
or not?
I leave tomorrow.
News of the sanctions will hit Monday.
Let's meet before you go.
You're a career diplomat, a professional.
Maybe that's why I trust you.
Then you take care of them,
so they feel good and they take care of you.
So you feel good because...
I mean, Rachel was really beautiful.
You could tell that from across the street.
I never saw her from across the street, though.
Isn't that a funny thing to think about?
A lot of people, I think,
they spot the one they love from across the street sometimes.
It's like they're running an errand,
and they happen to spot the one they love
across the street running a different errand.
There's this sudden thrill, like...
while the person you love
is inhabiting the same world as you.
And they're just walking around,
buying, I don't know... Vitaminwater,
and maybe they know that you love them while they're doing it,
and maybe it means they're nice to a cashier.
I never got to see her from across the street, though.
It just never happened.
I don't want you to burn yourself.
No burning, no.
Rachel liked to smoke.
She said she was gonna stop,
but she would have a rule that she'd only smoke
when we listened to this one band we both loved.
Because of the ceremony.
"It should be a ceremony," it's what she said.
Well, even if it's gum,
I still prefer to step outside to chew it.
Like lighting a delicious cigarette.
The things we miss, the rituals...
Excuse me.
  She doesn't like me.   She will.
Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him.
You know you can't legally remove Claire Underwood,
even if you win in the House?
I'm working on that.
I'm not interested.
He needs you. I need you.
So does the country.
I'm not a politician.
I can give orders, I can follow orders
and I know when the hell to shut up.
And you're a steady hand, which, again, the country needs.
  I'm not gonna be Conway's patsy.   No, you're not.
He's a difficult man to be around.
It's over. It's over.
The process chose Claire Underwood.
We'll get there.
You'll be called vice president,
but you will be, de facto, something more.
What were you doing there?
I asked Seth Grayson about Lisa Williams.
Why the hell did you think that was an appropriate thing to do?
Didn't I tell you to drop this lead?
Is it still a lead? Because nobody's on it.
Nobody's on it because she's a junkie,
and everything she said to me
is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto,
which has been picked apart by every message board
and conspiracy theorist on the Internet.
At first, Grayson said her name didn't ring a bell,
but then he called me out of the blue
and asked me if we were still looking into it.
So I followed up.
You looked through my notes.
You're out.
  What?   You're fired, Jeffries.
It's a story. I was following it.
I don't want you on my team.
Get out of my office.
We know we can win both states.
Why would we not take this deal?
No. The Underwoods want a revote
because they know they can't win in the House. We can.
We need to make a deal that forces Claire Underwood to resign.
  And why does that matter?   If I may?
  Madam Speaker.   Speaking from the Hill,
as vice president,
she'll have a public pulpit to discredit your every move.
I'm going to exile Claire Underwood to the Naval Observatory
and stack her schedule with state funerals in Southeast Asia.
She'll never see the inside of the West Wing,
let alone the Oval.
You need Brockhart by your side, supporting you.
I don't want to hear about Brockhart.
What matters is that Will becomes president.
Underwood in office can cause an enormous amount damage.
Whereas, if they lose, they're losers.
I want this election to be between me
and Francis Underwood.
Well, it isn't up to you.
Speaker McCarthy isn't letting this particular bill to the floor,
unless we have an amendment attached
that removes Claire Underwood.
Will...
Now, if you expect a willing partner in the White House,
you'd better let that bill get to the floor as is.
If you get to the Oval, Will,
you're gonna need the Speaker more than she needs you.
So, I'm gonna call her back,
and you are going to apologize.
Will.
Will, get back here!
Will!
Enough.
Shut the door.
You look like death.
I can't get in touch with the kidnappers.
It's been radio silence for almost  hours.
There's rumors they don't even have him anymore.
I can't keep this from the president any longer.
Okay.
And then I'll tell him what a big help you've been.
Sanctions hit in a couple of hours.
Deal with Secretary Durant
or with some very unhappy billionaires.
You will allow me to exploit whatever oil I find in Antarctica.
And I'll tell you why.
I have something.
Or rather, someone you need.
What are you talking about?
Someone in your administration
was willing to pay a great deal of money for his safe return.
Your Aidan Macallan.
He's here. In the Kremlin.
Who do you think orchestrated that leak?
Seems to know quite a lot.
Excuse me one moment. The Secretary of State is here.
  Madam Secretary.   Gentlemen.
You must know Aidan?
I don't believe I do.
Nice to meet you.
  You're American?   I am.
Before we begin, I'd just like you to know that
the president and the former president are on the line.
Cathy...
You can pick up the phone, if you like.
Mr. President.
It's best you come back to Washington.
Find anything yet?
Not yet.
Thank you again, Mr. Barnes,
for letting me take a look.
I won't be long.
This is everything?
This is everything they sent from Zoe's apartment.
I just, you know...
I just can't seem to throw anything out.
I mean, it's just papers, but...
Anyway, I'll leave you to it.
  Okay. Thank you.   Yeah.
Okay.
The Black Caucus? Really?
I like Mark, because I always know where he stands.
It's usually on someone's neck.
What did you buy yourselves, another day?
Enough time to talk to David Rasmussen,
who you clearly spoke to before.
And to meet with Jordan Sadowsky
and the rest of the Republican leadership.
And what happens Tuesday? Or Wednesday?
Look, I... I can have David and the House
vote on this every single session.
Our backgrounds are different,
but we're both hardscrabble boys at heart.
We need the last word, last blow,
last move.
We can push the bill through the House
for a new election for president in Tennessee and Ohio.
Speaker McCarthy won't let that happen.
But I could... convince her
if you were to step down,
and our full tickets president and vice president
run against each other in Tennessee and Ohio.
Well, to hell with that. Well, to hell with that.
We'll make the deal. I think this is the right thing to do.
Tomorrow, I'll announce my intention
to step down after the revote.
I'll let the Speaker know to put the bill on the floor.
We have one more outstanding piece of business,
the Supreme Court nominee.
We'll need to appoint someone to break the four-four deadlock.
Approve Congress' new election date.
We, uh, have several people in mind.
I want you to appoint Elizabeth Benson.
Well, she's liberal enough for you to swallow,
and conservative enough when it counts.
We don't have time for Senate hearings.
I can make a recess happen.
I'll see you on the campaign trail.
Where does that leave me, huh, Alex?
I went out on a limb here.
If we don't have a vote in the House, then what?
Mark Usher is your friend, not mine.
Mark Usher's no one's friend.
Francis Underwood hasn't won a thing, okay?
And there's a good... More than a good chance that Will Conway
will be the next President of the United States.
Could you give me a moment? It's been a difficult few days.
Better?
Yes.
We couldn't let the House vote proceed on Monday.
Why not?
Because you would've lost.
Even if Conway took the presidency,
we would've had a foothold with you.
We could've sabotaged, just like we did with the Walkers.
The Conways are not the Walkers.
It wasn't your decision to make.
Excuse me?
You said it yourself. You're only acting.
I agreed with Usher
because he will sacrifice everything
to get Brockhart into office,
which makes Conway weak, ready to lose.
I thought you saw what I saw.
I did. I do.
We're perfectly in sync, Claire.House.of.Cards.SE
If we give him what he wants...
If we give Usher what he says, his justice, that is it.
It's over. He owns us.
  Don't exaggerate.   I wish I were.
You've made a thousand deals.
Yeah, well, this one is different.
  Why?   Because I can feel it right here.
  Do you hear yourself?   Yeah, loud and clear.
I'm a little confused that you don't seem to hear me at all.
Once we're solidly back in power,
  we will regain our position...   That is naive.
Naive is new for you.
Realistic. Not naive.
Everything we've worked for, we can kiss it goodbye.
We agreed to Usher's pick. It's non-negotiable.
That's exactly right. It's his pick. It's his justice.
He's trying to control our house. The White House.
I gave him my word, Francis.
Your word?
Your word? This conversation is pointless.
Grow up!
Who do you think you are?
I think I am a temporary president
trying to get you back in office.
And if you don't think that we're at a critical juncture in the road,
you are pathetically mistaken.
Wake up, Claire! Wake up!
Recorded this morning EET
in the Yarmouk neighborhood of Damascus.
Seems he developed a taste for chocolate while at Cambridge.
Smiling for the camera is Ahmed Al Ahmadi,
Yusuf's brother.
Are you sure?
I had a long conversation with Yusuf Al Ahmadi.
They look nothing alike.
It's him.
Is Ahmed still in our sights?
  He is.   This is a rare opportunity.
We should seize the moment and make a targeted strike.
  Director, please.   Madam President...
Is there some issue, General?
Ahmed Al Ahmadi didn't travel all the way
from his compound to Damascus to buy a candy bar.
He's meeting with someone. Let's find out who.
Unless we're detected, and he disappears for good.
But if we wait,
there's a huge potential to learn more about ICO.
Its members, contacts, habits, tactics.
You know, you're sounding uncharacteristically dovish
this morning, General.
I agree with General Braegher.
While a successful air strike against Ahmadi
  would play well...   This isn't about the election, Cathy.
No, of course not. I mean, if we do this correctly,
we can begin the process of dismantling ICO's network.
Take him out.
If the president agrees,
I think it's the best thing for the country.
Well, I think it would send a very clear message to ICO.
In the short term, yes, but...
No other term is relevant.
I think we have been operating
under the shadow of terror for too long.
For the sake of the American people, we need to act now.
What's the timetable, General?
For an actionable location, most likely a number of hours.
Thank you.
You're wasting our time.
We're being selective about where and how he appears.
Soon he won't be at any events at all.
Hannal, we're just trying to land him and you in the White House.
And it's not Brockhart-Conway, Mark. It's the opposite.
He won't put up with this much longer.
I'm sure it's hard on him.
I have to take this. I'm sorry.
What happens after he gets there?
  To Will? What happens?   We'll be there for him.
  You and General Brockhart?   Yes.
What will Will's role be?
I will continue to support your husband.
Give me a real answer. You owe me that.
His role will be President of the United States.
The mic was still hot and Brockhart just kept talking.
  That's what she said.   Insubordination?
  That's the word she used?   It's what it sounded like to her.
He was talking about soldiers and he said, quote,
"I'll be the first to tell them not to listen."
  Can she get her hands on the actual clip?   For a price.
  I thought she was a friend.   Yeah, a smart friend.
It's a nice  second spot, post-debate.
If there is a debate.
Hits them at their strength.
Takes the military credibility away.
This is the kind of thing that can turn an election.
Whatever this costs... it's worth it.
Let's secure it and then verify it.
Recess appointment of Judge Benson or no,
people need to stay focused on the revote in Tennessee and Ohio
and how the hell we got here.
All right.
I'll have my assistant Angela reach out
to confirm what time you need me at the studio.
All right. Yep. Yeah.
I collected everything I could find
about the day Doug Stamper was carjacked.
Good.
All right, so...
where was that?
Where that happened?
In Maryland.
Right around, um...
Yeah, I grew up about a half an hour from there...
It's here.
And Rachel Posner's...
last known address.
I'd say they were about  minutes apart.
I'm not sure why I need to explain myself to you.
Why would you go to the NSA?
I was inquiring into the well-being of an American citizen.
He's just a disgruntled hacker.
Then why are you so interested in him?
How did he look?
I'm asking for me.
I've known Aidan since I was  years old.
He and my mom dated for several years.
Was a long time ago, obviously.
But as far as the NSA job, he didn't want it.
I made him take it.
I don't understand how they got him or why he's there.
I need to know that he is safe.
He looked fine.
What does he know, LeAnn?
Probably about the same as you and me,
which is why we need to keep him out of any serious trouble.
I don't want to get involved in your personal life, LeAnn.
  I'm here to see the president.   Of course.
But when you think about it, Cathy,
we're all sort of involved here.
If he is in any kind of danger, he is not built for it.
Hi, Cathy.
Jane.
LeAnn Harvey, Jane Davis. Jane is under secretary  
Deputy under secretary of commerce for international trade.
It's a mouthful.
Yeah, it's good to put a face to the voice.
Uh, do you have any ibuprofen?
  Oh, I might have some aspirin.   No.
  I'm allergic. Gives me hives.   We may have some.
You're the Harveys of the tire company, yes?
My father and uncle sold the business  years ago.
And the treads haven't been the same since.
But it's great. You finally landed in D.C.
I'll let the president know you're both here.
Uh, thank you for this.
Let's just reverse those two sentences and it's there.
It's to the point.
  Pithy.   Yes, pithy.
Your meeting is here.
Thank you.
And Justice Benson is en route
to the White House for the announcement.
I'll have her wait in the Yellow Oval.
Uh, great. Can you send the others in, please?
Of course.
Is the former president meeting us in the Rose Garden?
Francis will not be there.
He's not needed.
Miss Davis.
Secretary Durant.
  It's been a long time.   Yes, where was that?
A think tank in Aspen, early .
Oh, there was a lot of thinking happening back then.
I'm glad we put a stop to that.
Please, have a seat.
So, I've gone over the numbers
of the proposed agreement of steel with Beijing
and I have a couple of questions for you.
Madam President, we need to evacuate you now.
What's going on?
Please, Madam President. It's urgent.
Ma'am.
Where are you taking me?
  We're moving you to the PEOC.   Why?
They'll brief you down below, ma'am.
Where's Francis?
Where's Doug Stamper? And Mr. Yates?
We're following protocol, ma'am.
National Security Advisor Cafferty is on her way.
  Ma'am?   No, we'll wait for Francis.
He'll meet you inside.
We will wait for Francis. That's an order.
  Madam President.   Miss Cafferty, what's going on?
Nothing's confirmed yet,
but a truck carrying radioactive material has gone missing.
  Is this real?   We have to talk to Green.
Let's head inside.
Yes.
I see. Thank you.
Homeland received word from Cybercom
that a truck carrying three cesium  irradiators
missed two checkpoints.
It was supposed to be traveling from Atlanta
back to the manufacturer in Baltimore.
Where do we think the truck is now?
Truck's GPS is offline.
How the hell does a thing like that happen?
  We'll have to reevaluate.   You're damn right we will.
But we need to make some decisions.
We should notify Metro PD and Virginia State Police.
Are we gonna evacuate the public?
No. Before we do anything,
I wanna speak to the head of counterterrorism.
Get Assistant Director Green on the line.
  Ma'am, Homeland is over...   The president is right.
Ma'am?
This is President Underwood.
At this time, we have no idea who's responsible.
Director Green, perhaps it's better
I patch you into the whole room. One second.
The driver's been unreachable since his shift began.
There's enough radiation on that truck
to impact a  mile radius.
Even if it's not weaponized, it would be in the air,
in the water, children, people...
General, I can hear the wheels grinding from here.
I'd rather not speculate, sir.
Oh, please do.
Over the past several days, there has been increased ICO chatter,
but that is the new normal.
We've sent over stats and maps of potentially affected areas.
I don't know what's worse.
A dirty bomb about to go off or what'll happen to the city
when they know we're looking for one.
  Who do we have left upstairs?   Seth and LeAnn.
You stay in touch with Green.
If this is a dirty bomb,
then we've just entered a different world.
Yes, sir.
All right, we need to stay focused
on our contingency plan for an evacuation
without the appearance of doing so.
We need to be ready to implement one way...
We need to get the cleanup team from the Energy...
...whose jurisdiction it is to get the security cams...
Yes. Whenever it happens,
this appointment would break the court's deadlock.
And we would get this election going again.
But let's step back a minute.
Tennessee is out of the equation.
Whoever wins that state, it's not enough.
It's come down to one state. Ohio.
One state is about to choose
the next President of these United States.
How did we let this happen?
And it keeps happening.
This is an administration that operates behind closed doors,
out of the public eye.
Today's sudden postponement is typical.
With no announcement in the Rose Garden,
and literally zero news coming from the White House,
one has to wonder what is going on behind the scenes
to cause this unexpected delay.
The silence is deafening.
After such a protracted,
confusing and, frankly, chaotic election,
we deserve clarity.
Instead, here we are again...
left out of the loop and on the edge of our seats.
I just hope America isn't getting used to this.
  Hello?   Hey, it's me.
Doug?
Why wasn't I read in?
  To what?   Whatever's going on.
If this is gonna play for us, the president in the bunker,
I need to know how to play it.
There's a truck carrying
radioactive material that's gone missing.
Okay. Should Seth and I prepare a statement?
  Where are we saying the truck is?   We don't know.
  When are we gonna find it?   We don't know.
Wait, is something really happening?
Probably not.
  Hello?   Probably not?
What am I supposed to do?
  Is that Doug?   Yeah.
Can I talk to him?
  Hey, what can you tell us?   Act normal.
Stay on point.
Comment only on the ongoing campaign.
I've already postponed their scheduled events.
Look, are we in danger here or what?
I can't answer.
Because I don't know.
Await further instructions from Homeland.
All right.
Doug, should we be here?
He hung up.
What are we doing?
Nora thinks we need to notify Speaker McCarthy.
I think it's too soon for a continuity of government.
If we're planning an evacuation, Congress needs to be notified  
I said, I believe it is a bit too early.
Madam President, Director Morrison thinks that  
Wait a minute. Where is Director Morrison? Why  
She opted to stay at ODNI.
She's monitoring from there.
Well, at least let's get her on the phone.
We should have wiped out ICO when we had the chance.
We didn't ask for your personal opinion, General.
What we need is an update on the Ahmed Al Ahmadi situation.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll check with Director Morrison now.
I have contacts, you know.
Private contractors in the region that might be of help.
Are you suggesting that your contacts
know more than the Bureau, the NSA  
I'm not suggesting anything.
I'm telling you.
I know third parties that have negotiated with ICO in the past.
Hostages and whatnot... who may know something.
But I need a line.
Just a... a secure one.
I can barely breathe in here.
I'm gonna go get us a cup of coffee.
How does Miss Davis have this level of clearance?
That's a good question.
  Did we bring this on ourselves?   What?
  I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.   Listen to me.
Everything we've done, everything,
is exactly what we had to do.
We don't even know if this is real.
I get these in Hong Kong.
The best instant coffee comes out of the Pacific Rim.
  Would you like one?   If you can spare it.
Oh, I always have three or four in my bag.
I wonder how long we'll be down here.
The situation's still unclear.
I shouldn't be drinking coffee. I still feel a little shaky.
You don't look it.
Feel my pulse.
You seem very much in control to me.
So do you.
What does that say about the two of us?
Yes, thank you.
The SEAL team is on the trail of Ahmed Al Ahmadi,
but National Intelligence
believes he's discovered we're following him
and the truck is a countermeasure.
ICO wants to see Ahmadi walking out of Damascus in one piece.
If we strike, they will hit back.
Capital-wide evacuation procedures need to be initiated  
  Just hold on!   No, the public is our priority  
Hold on! I want to know how close we are to a strike
and where this goddamn truck is
before we make any final decisions.
"We make any decisions"?
Yes, I am still in a position to make  
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you are not in a position  
Nora. The enemy isn't in here.
Cafferty is right. We should evacuate.
But it's the general who's on my mind.
Miss Cafferty.
I was entirely out of line. Please accept my apology.
I spoke with Davis.
  And?   Nothing. She was just flexing.
Cathy.
Who called a meeting with Claire today?
You or Miss Davis?
Jane did.
Thank you very much, Cathy.
  Was that all?   Yes, thank you.
Oh, sorry, one more thing.
When did Braegher get his fourth star? Which administration?
A couple back.
So he and Brockhart together?
And a few others who were elevated around the same time, yes.
Thank you, Cathy.
That Brockhart spot we talked about. You have it?
Is it verified?
Hold on.
Ready.
I swear to God,
if Underwood puts soldiers on those borders,
I'll be the first to tell them not to listen.
If the President of the United States gives orders like that,
you put him out of his misery.
That's it. That's all I have.
No, that's good.
If we survive the day.
Is Seth still in the office with you?
I'm in the Oval, sitting behind the Resolute desk.
That's not you.
You know, you keep deciding who I am
and you keep reading me wrong.
Are there rumors about what's going on down here?
Yes, but we're deflecting.
  Has the Conway campaign reached out?   Not yet.
The general's on a stump in Ohio and the governor's off the grid.
  Okay. Stay on him.   I will.
Unless it's the end of the world and it doesn't matter.
Goodbye, Doug Stamper.
Are you sure you should be in there, Goldilocks?
Are you all right?
Honestly, I was thinking about how far down we are
and how it's not my favorite thing.
I... I'm sorry. Do... do you need to be in here?
No. No, no. It's fine.
I used to have a fear of flying, but I got over it.
Doesn't bother me at all anymore.
But the pendulum seems to have swung the other way.
If I think too hard, I start to feel buried.
Forgive me. It's the recirculated air, makes things worse.
Miss Davis, why are you here?
  This is where the Secret Service led me.   No.
Access list or not, you have to choose to be here.
I always choose the safest place.
Why are you here?
It felt like an opportunity.
A chance for a meeting, not quite on the books.
I just got off the phone, Madam President.
I have information from abroad, from private contractors...
Ahmadi is in Damascus.
And a number of parties were racing to capture him,
including, of course, the United States.
But no one...
will be capturing him today.
Or before the election.
I've made a career...
out of dealing with problematic parts of the world.
It's kind of my vocation to imagine the unimaginable.
Excuse me.
  Pardon me.   I'm sorry.
  It's all right.   Excuse me, Mr. President.
I had the distinct feeling she was offering Ahmadi to us.
Meaning?
She said there are a number of groups looking to capture him,
but that no one will. Not today or before the election.
We brought this on ourselves.
  We pushed too hard.   We've survived.
  We isolated ourselves, Francis.   So what?
We both know something
the rest of the world refuses to acknowledge.
There is no justice, only conquest.
And let me tell you, we let them evacuate D.C.,
we are done, Claire. We've lost.
Yes?
I just spoke to LeAnn. You need to hear this.
I swear to God,
if Underwood puts soldiers on those borders,
I'll be the first to tell them not to listen.
If the President of the United States gives orders like that,
you put him out of his misery.
Let me out.
  I'm sorry, sir. I'm not allowed     Open the door.
  My orders are to     I am no longer the president.
I have no responsibilities or obligations. Isn't that correct?
We can't send you above until the threat is contained  
  Open this door.   Let him out.
  Ma'am?   Let the president out.
Open the door.
Open it.
Ma'am.
We need to initiate evacuation now.
No, General. We'll do it when I say so.
I'm really sorry.
I know I agreed to do this, but I have to go pick up my kids.
Okay. Well, what if I just rode in the car with you?
You know, parents are texting one another.
One of them works at the NSA
and he thinks there's a terror threat, so...
I mean, this has happened before, but you just... You never know.
My mom died of kidney failure last month.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Uh, was she on the donor list?
Yeah, but not close enough to the top.
Do you mind? You could talk while we walk out of here.
Um... sure. Yeah.
Uh, how long was Anthony sick for?
Uh... about two years.
And he fought it hard. So hard. The entire way.
This unit, if they pay cash, I don't ask questions.
  But you remember these young women?   Yeah, of course.
They were very close, if you know what I mean.
But they were sweet.
And did you ever see... this man?
Look, I don't know what was going on here.
But you recognize him?
Yeah. Okay?
Someone looking like him paid the rent. Three months, up-front.
But like I said, I don't judge.
I'm not sure what you're asking, Mr. President.
Oh, please.
Someone or someones...
tried to make my wife and I lose the election
by keeping us underground today.
And I would like to know what you know about that.
We've all been responding
in real time to a potential terrorist attack.
But you chose to stay here.
Why weren't you in the bunker with us?
I chose to remain in my office
to oversee the capture or killing of one Ahmed Al Ahmadi.
And yet there was great tension this morning
between you and General Braegher.
Difference in approach.
We are not going to evacuate the District of Columbia.
I want you to understand that. Come what may.
And I promise you this... Vanessa.
When I find out exactly what has happened,
I'm going to remember this conversation,
when you chose to withhold information.
General Braegher is a strong supporter of General Brockhart.
Did they conspire?
Did they use... terror...
and this evacuation to cost me this election?
I'm not a fan of the general...
but... that's a strong charge,
and there's no proof to support it.
You know, what you people protect best is each other.
We lost Ahmadi a short time ago
and believe he is no longer in Damascus.
Of course.
Of course.
Now you listen to me...
This was nothing more or less
than an attempted coup, plain and simple.
And I do not know to what degree you have been directly involved.
But you will resolve it.
Now.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
The truck's been found.
Now we can't know for sure,
but it looks as though ICO wasn't involved.
The irradiators and cesium were accounted for.
The truck was accidentally parked
at a medical device factory in Durham.
The plant foreman never reported it.
So we can relax for now, at least.
I just wanna thank you all for your efforts. Thank you.
Madam President. You'll have my resignation in the morning.
Nora...
these were extraordinary circumstances today.
What would our administration be
if we didn't allow for some human failings?
Get the presser going. We're coming up now.
Concerning Ahmadi...
We didn't find him.
You will. You can.
  What are you offering?   Help.
If you'd like it, Madam President.
Can you elaborate on the drill earlier today?
Well, drills happen all the time.
It's part of the administration's ongoing efforts
to keep the country safe.
  Yes, but there's usually a warning.   What's the point of that?
Who's next?
Did you look at the file?
I didn't have to.
I'll expect your signature
on the resignation letter within the hour.
Unless you choose to implicate whoever else was involved.
You don't deserve to be in the White House.
Neither you nor your husband.
I'd wish you the best, but I don't think you'll need it.
I'm fairly certain you'll do very well in the private sector.
I've scheduled a meeting with Jane Davis for the end of the week.
Good.
Also, I was going to mention this earlier,
but Cathy's been very curious about Aidan Macallan.
I've thrown her off the scent, but...
Cathy's not the problem. The problem is Macallan,
and the person who allowed Macallan to become the problem.
The foundation's raised over K.
Anthony became status one on the donor list on March th, .
Moretti talked about it as, uh, the last day of her life
before she corrected herself.
What else, spent every spare second with the kids.
They were building a go-kart.
They were pretty close to done.
  Okay.   I got more.
  No, I got it.   What were you looking for?
It's nothing.
  Okay.   What?
You wanna tell me what happened in the White House today?
No, I don't.
All right, I've been waiting to say something,
but I've waited and I don't want to wait anymore.
Consider me for a job at the White House, in comms.
"Go get this. Find me that. I need this."
I'm tired of it.
If you don't ask, you get asked.
That's what I'm starting to realize.
I'll put a word in.
Yeah? Well, what does that mean?
It means that when the moment is right, I'll mention you.
Yes, whenever it happens...
this appointment would break the court's deadlock
and we would get this election going again.
But let's step back a minute...
  Tennessee...   Where's your salt?
  Whoever wins that state...   Right side of the sink.
It's come down to one state:
Ohio.
One state is about to choose
the next President of these United States.
Was it really a drill?
This is an administration that operates behind closed doors.
You know, with everything that was happening today,
this reporter from the Herald came by.
What?
Wants to do a story on Tony and the foundation.
What was his name?
Davis implied she could help us track down Ahmadi.
I think we should hear what she has to say.
She's got a quality about her, doesn't she?
Attractive and terrifying.
Like the urge to pet a red tail fox.
The general offered his letter?
Uh, he did. And refused to implicate anyone.
You were right, Claire. We need to sit down with Usher.
Just so happens, he's going to Northern California this weekend
to meet with a group of men
to discuss the crisis and the future of our country.
  Well, you need to be invited to that.   Yes, let's get him in.
I know it's obvious, but it always strikes me.
No women.
Well, it was a different time.
Terrible.
The war or the restrictions of the era?
Both.
Well, you know my position.
I'm all for women in combat.
False alarm...
I was worried about you.
I worry about you all the time, Claire.
But I know that's not the kind of thing you like to hear.
Mark. Come in.
  We have much to discuss.   Madam President.
Mr. President.
As I believe you know,
yesterday we had something of a drill here in the White House.
I know people are wondering what that was about.
Yes. Everyone except you.
The announcement of the recess appointment of Judge Benson
has been rescheduled for tomorrow morning.
Good. So...
we have an election.
Which you will not be able to win
with another so-called October surprise.
  Well, we are way past October.   We certainly are.
I understand Ahmed Al Ahmadi is still a threat?
Yes, but he's so elusive, as you know.
It's a shame you weren't able to capture him.
Well...
I believe that the opportunity
will present itself to the next president,
whomever he may be.
If Will Conway wins the office,
I can assure you that'll be a top priority.
This terror has got to stop.
I've taken enough of your time.
Mark, I just want to play something for you.
It'll only take a moment.
I swear to God,
if Underwood puts soldiers on those borders,
I'll be the first to tell them not to listen.
If the President of the United States gives orders like that,
you put him out of his  
Okay. I don't need to hear anymore.
Oh, but, Mark...
it gets so much better.House.of.Cards.SE
Crow of Elysium, we honor thee!
We honor thee! We honor thee! We honor thee!
No mortal flame can destroy common woe.
Just one fire can conquer.
Fire that burns in the fields of Elysium.
Hail, brothers! Many brothers!
Brothers many, make brothers one.
Hail, fellowship! Hail Crow in his verdant kingdom.
Common woe, be done!
Hail, brothers! Common woe, be done!
Set us free! Set us free!
Set us free! Set us free! Set us free!
Set us free! Set us free! Set us free!
Set us free! Set us free!
Set us free! Set us free!
Set us free! Set us free!
Yeah... look around.
Some of the most powerful men in the world
are gathered in this clearing.
Members of one of our country's most exclusive clubs.
Invitation only, unless, of course, you invite yourself.
They gather here to seek God
between the branches of these magnificent trees.
They eat together, they piss next to each other,
and they carve up the world like a Sunday roast.
This is where the real power is.
No women or presidents allowed.
The former, I am not. The latter, I will be again,
because I have managed to reduce
a national election down to one state.
And while these men here
can't swing the votes of an entire nation...
one measly state?
Well, that they can do. And that's why I'm here.
So welcome to Elysian Fields.
It's strange for you, isn't it? Without him here.
It's not strange, ma'am.
LeAnn's in Cincinnati, trying to close the deal for the debate.
The president will make a series of appearances across the state
as soon as he gets back.
If he survives the weekend. Anything?
No phones allowed.
Well, we're dividing and conquering.
This Chinese trade agreement
is going to make Ohio voters very happy.
It could help us win.
  I didn't know the deal had closed.   Well, we're on the verge.
The president can make the announcement in Canton when he appears.
Oh, no, I'll be announcing myself...
since I did the deal.
Doug, you are very sincere...
and very loyal to Francis.
And loyal to you, ma'am.
I hope you know that.
I don't mind it if you call me Claire, you know.
I'll show Ms. Davis in.
Hi, Jane.
Would you mind going over these numbers with me
before we meet with the minister?
I have what China says they'll settle for,
and what I know they'll settle for.
And listen, I want to thank you so much for helping us with this.
I'd like to see an Underwood administration.
Doug, that's all for now.
Yes, ma'am.
  You can show me.   I don't want to.
You don't have to protect me.
Each of them has a story.
Even if they got lost somewhere.
It's harder to disappear than you would think.
But Rachel...
is nowhere.
I recognize that neck.
Frank Underwood, as I live and breathe.
Well, I owe you this.
He didn't expect you to show up.
I'm always happy to see old friends.
And make new ones. Frank Underwood.
  Benjamin Grant.   Oh, of Pollyhop. Of course.
You're a big supporter of my opponent.
He's a forward-thinking guy and a friend,
who should be president right now.
There's no talking politics or business
while we're here, gentlemen.
Yes, we don't want to poison all this nature with words.
You know the motto.
Yes, "Buzzing bees, sting not here."
It's hard to miss.
Ted, I think you know everybody.
Common woe never stood a chance. Mr. President.
First time you've been invited, I understand.
I'm almost sure there's an insult in there somewhere, General.
You know, Ted and I
just had the most remarkable piece of red meat
at a steak house out in Canton.
I can't remember, do you like prime rib?
In the right company.
If you'll excuse us,
Ted and I promised young Benjamin here
we'd find him an adult beverage.
  Drink?   I'd rather not.
You know, everybody was looking forward to
spending some time with the general.
And now you're here as well.
After this weekend, who knows?
Maybe this goddamn bastard of an election
will get itself resolved.
Oh, one little piece of advice
that I could give you as long as you're out here.
If you don't bother the yellow jackets, they won't bother you.
So why didn't you invite Conway?
Brockhart was invited instead.
So there's not going to be a debate next week, is there?
Not a presidential one, no.
I should really be in Ohio, shaking hands.
Yeah, you bargained to get in here, Francis,
and now you're here. So let me suggest something.
Fuck Ohio.
This is the campaign.
The general is a traitor, you know that.
The general is trying to be a politician.
You would have done the same.
Yeah, but better.
President Underwood?
President Underwood? I'm sorry, ma'am,
but you're needed in the Situation Room.
Cathy.
I wanted a moment with you before we join the rest of the team.
  Oh, I was briefed on the way over.   Not fully.
A Russian research vessel is stuck and sinking  
Yes, they claim they were taking core samples,
some global warming nonsense.
But they were looking for oil.
There was a distress signal
and then all communication just shut down.
We're the only country in position to rescue.
So,  minutes ago, we offered.
  They declined?   And denied.
Petrov does not want us to see what's on board.
I understand this is a difficult decision,
but there are human lives at stake,
and if help arrives,
  Petrov will be forced to take it.   Okay.
Well, thank you. I need to speak with President Petrov directly.
A rescue at sea and a chance to embarrass us?
Just before your second Election Day?
Sounds like I would be helping you, hmm?
The boat sinks, your crew dies.
How is that going to look at home?
I tell my people how things look, and that's how they look.
I want to show you something.
Wait a minute.
There. Do you like my face?
A beard doesn't suit you.
I wonder how your citizens would feel about what you've done.
I could return your crew to Russia, Viktor.
You could return Aidan Macallan.
I don't like to quantify human worth...
but Macallan's is higher.
Social media is a powerful tool.
If there is any rescue attempt by the United States,
I will tell the people of Ohio exactly how you look to them.
Exactly how you disrupted their state's vote.
And they will believe me.
Oppenheimer was a member.
That tree right over there,
right under that tree, Manhattan Project was born.
And right under this one, I'm relieving myself.
I hope you're not equating me to the atom bomb.
What do you want? Cabinet position?
  Frank Underwood     Judicial appointments?
  Legislative support?   Ah, buzzing bees, buzzing bees.
Oh, right. Because the Manhattan Project
had absolutely nothing to do
  with business or politics.   I want you to breathe.
I want you to look how the moonlight cuts through the trees.
Take this time, Francis,
to know your other attendees.
Think about what kind of president you really want to be.
What am I supposed to do with that?
Just...
Oh, is that what you told the general?
Insubordination.
Clandestine coup.
Oh, yes, that's the stuff of real leadership.
People with money like uniforms.
Mark, just tell me what they want.
They're waiting for you.
You're up early, Mr. President.
Always.
Are you hungry? I have, uh, eggs,
and orange juice, mountain oysters.
You mean bull's testicles, don't you?
I prefer to call things what they are.
This is unexpected.
I thought you'd stay out there campaigning
till your dying breath.
What, and leave you out here all alone in the wilderness
to make all these important decisions?
You've done well by me, Raymond. I'd like your support.
I've done well by your wife.
Who happens, at this moment, to rule the White House.
Tell me you're not peddling influence with your wife?
Who, you mean the current acting President of the United States?
For the next two weeks.
A little restraint? Now, that... that would be unexpected.
How do you like your eggs?
In the afternoon.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Oh, no presidents here at Elysian Fields, isn't that right?
Only former ones... or future.
Well, I won't call this politics, then. Just current affairs.
We had a real chance to get Ahmadi.
Our campaign was briefed.
I think a little more than just briefed.
Do you have an extra pair of socks, Raymond?
After  years of military service,
you'd think I'd arrive prepared.
Oh, I'm sure someone around here could find you a pair.
  Under my bunk.   Thank you.
He's a good man.
Hard to find anybody who distrusts or dislikes him.
So do you want eggs or not?
With this rate of tariff,
I'm confident it'll have a mitigating effect
on the anti-dumping cases.
I think this is going to work.
I'll need to run this by my State Councilor for Foreign Affairs.
I think this is a very good day for both of our countries.
Yes, it is.
There's an American on the boat.
The Russian research vessel.
  And how do you know that?   Mr. Xu told me before you came in.
I will need proof of that fact.
Of course, but we are only telling you
because we know you'll want to rescue him.
And China is willing to help in any way we can.
I'm just curious, Mr. Xu,
why are you so focused on this situation?
For humanitarian reasons.
Thank you for your time and cooperation, Madam Acting President.
It's contingent.
The minister won't proceed with our tariff deal
if we don't give him assurances that the rescue is underway.
Why do the Chinese care so much
about what's on this Russian boat?
I don't know. I was just informed myself.
Are they working together?
Again, I don't know.
Are you working with them?
I work with everybody.
But that's beside the point. There is an American on board.
And you believe that?
Well, you wouldn't want to make the wrong call.
Bull's balls.
A giant crow.
And billionaires chanting, "Set me free."
Well, this place says everything I feel, but can't express.
He can't be your friend.
Tusk doesn't have any friends.
He's, uh, an associate.
Really?
And how does he associate with you?
Oh, to hell with the buzzing bees. No one else is heeding it.
A network president, a telecom CEO,
the vice presidential candidate.
What do you think they're all talking about,
  the last book they read?   What are you reading?
Your face...
which tells me how much you don't want to be here.
Mr. Tusk was a major donor on Will's campaign.
Yes, so it's interesting that he wasn't invited.
We're partnering on a project.
Large-scale data storage centers in the desert.
Solar-powered.
I need to get ready for my talk.
"The Life After: What We Leave Behind."
Hope you'll be there.
Smell that.
Cohiba.
I know you're a fan.
Even though I don't smoke anymore, doesn't mean I can't  
Who called this weekend's gathering? You?
No. Tusk did.
Why?
We think the Chinese are right. There is an American on board.
This is Thad Peterson. Retired two years ago.
Director of geophysics research
for some of the country's top oil companies.
We strongly suspect he's on board the boat.
Working with the Russians.
Where's the proof?
This was sent from a Russian sailor's cell phone
before communications were cut off.
Get on the radio and call for help!
His wife confirmed that
this is Thad Peterson's voice on the recording.
In ,  hours tops, that boat's gone.
Yes, but that doesn't prove that Thad Peterson was on the ship.
But, ma'am... he is an American  
No, we can't be sure until we have a passenger manifest.
Let's reconvene when you know more.
  What is it, Cathy?   Your decision not to intervene.
If an American is working illegally,
he will not be on the manifest  
I haven't made a decision. I'm waiting for more information.
This is about Aidan Macallan.
I am very confident
China is lying about an American being on board.
There is something on that boat they want
and I can't proceed until I know what it is.
They say they're motivated by saving human lives.
But that's not what's driving them.
And I just find it so frustrating
when human life is treated with such disregard.
We're sorry. But...
The proverbial walk in the woods is not for me.
Navel-gazing on some forest path.
Contemplating mortality. Immortality.
No. History is earned.
You win the day, and then you win the day after,
and you do the same thing every day until you're dead.
And you're remembered not for the winning,
but because you never lost.
Now...
Doug?
Doug, can you hear me?
I need some leverage out here right now.
  What's going on?   Conway is finished.
If they win,
Brockhart will do all the heavy lifting.
He'll essentially be the president.
We should have used the oppo.
Listen, Brockhart is Tusk's pick.
I need to find a way to force that old man to support me.
  Sir? Mr. President?   Do you hear me?
I'm here.
Tusk has some deal with Pollyhop.
I need to find a way to stop that.
An executive order...
Sir?
A little restraint...
would be unexpected.
Mr. President?
  Doug.   Sir?
Don't do anything.
I don't understand.
Don't do anything until you hear from me.
  Sir, what about the Pollyhop deal?   Do you hear me?
  Don't do anything...   Mr. President, I...
Have you tried calling him back?
There's no answer. What should we do?
Nothing. That's what the president said, so that's what we'll do.
  Should we have his team pull him out?   No. We wait.
Ma'am...
  if we don't handle this rescue correctly...   Doug.
Let me find a way to get the president on the phone with Petrov.
No. Francis doesn't need this distraction.
I disagree.
I know you do.
They say we're only remembered for three generations.
What would one have to do not to be forgotten?
Young Benjamin here knows what's coming.
Who cares if he's never heard of Johnny Carson?
Poor old Tusk.
He wears that game face, but he doesn't fool me.
The future terrifies him because he knows it's short.
For the record, I have heard of Johnny Carson.
He tucked my parents into bed every night.
I've been given special permission
to show you what we've been working on.
Imagine the possibility of your brain, your consciousness,
stored digitally in real time.
I mean, what is immortality?
In time, even Grant's vision will get old.
It will happen, as it does for all of us.
Now this is still in the early stages,
but we've been collecting and storing
Raymond's memories, thoughts, quirks and tics.
This is a mock-up. But eventually...
this Raymond...
will feel as real as the one standing before you.
I like dirt and rocks...
and facts.
No argument here.
I trust only what I can hold in my hand or see on my horizon.
Well, but you can't just sit back and admire the view.
I've learned you've got to grab the present by the balls.
That's where the American people live.
You sound more like a salesman than a president, Mr. President.
Well, if we're Americans, then we are salesmen, right?
That's our birthright.
Cars and phones and a gallon of gas.
That's not how I see America.
I'm a patriot. I serve.
Well, then, we salute you, General.
But you serve to what purpose?
So the rest of America can sell.
I mean, you and I, right now, this weekend,
we're here at this camp selling ourselves.
Character speaks for itself.
People want a president they can trust.
No, they don't. They want a president they know.
And I know them.
The only future I'm interested in is the next four years.
So, yes, I'm selling tomorrow and the day after that
and the day after that.
I'm selling a boy who used to live on a peach farm
who now lives in the White House.
I'm selling a tomorrow
that you can see and touch and feel.
Now, you take that away,
and I don't know what this country has left.
Except a group of grown men
standing around in a circle, all staring at a small screen.
Looking in instead of looking out.
Heck, give me a peck of dirt any day of the week.
Hear, hear. To a peck of dirt.
  Hear, hear.   I will drink to that,
but I will also drink to the general, a good servant.
To the general.
I promise you, this deal is on the verge of falling apart.
Right before your revote.
I... I'm only the messenger, by the way.
We can't let this deal fall apart.
Agreed. But the rescue has to happen immediately.
You seem personally invested in this.
Oh, no, no. I'm just looking for a solution.
I had a thought.
I would be willing to allow the Chinese sailors
that are stationed on King George Island to board our icebreaker.
Then, purely for the in-house cameras,
we let it appear as though the Chinese led the rescue.
Now, of course, the whole time,
the Americans would remain in charge of the boat,
but the Russians don't need to know our involvement.
I imagine that would be acceptable.
I'll relay this scenario to Mr. Xu immediately.
But I'd also like to round up the tariff to  .
We have a firm deal at .
I know. But suddenly, it just doesn't seem high enough.
I think they'll be okay with it.
Fingers crossed. I'll do my best.
  That went rather well, I think.   It did. It went very well.
You've exceeded everyone's expectations,
the way you handled yourself all weekend, but...
Brockhart's someone they can predict.
Don't get ahead of yourself. This is not over.
What are you gonna do, Francis? Are you gonna use the oppo?
Well, it seems to have worried you enough.
He's still only the vice presidential candidate.
I'm leaving.
  You don't have to go.   No, I know. I don't have to do anything.
Do you remember when we first met?
You almost joined my second campaign.
We sat down at that little greasy spoon in Gaffney.
Yeah, if you'd signed me on, you would have won by a landslide.
I won anyway, because I never lose.
You know why I didn't hire you back then?
Because when you went to pick up the check,
you told me I didn't have to pay you.
That you would work for free. I don't trust that.
Because no one works for free.
Madam President, I'm afraid I can't agree to  .
  The economic implications     We're at an impasse.
I'm willing to keep the conversation going, but in the meantime  
We'll do nothing until you agree.
Madam President, people will die.
Which is why I'm surprised you won't agree to my terms.
I can't agree to the terms without the approval
of my State Councillor for Foreign Affairs.
There are  people aboard the vessel.
Now, it will go under in  to  hours.
The temperature of the Southern Ocean right now
is  degrees Fahrenheit.
A body will freeze to death within  minutes
in water that cold.
And, of course, one loses the ability to swim long before that.
Minister Xu, are you still there?
Collaborating with President Petrov is always a mistake.
The   tariff will help you keep that in mind.
I'm waiting.
It's up to you if they live or die.
  The crew?   All rescued.
And Thad Peterson?
You were right. The Chinese were lying.
He's the only one still unaccounted for.
The admiral says there's still a chance to save the boat.
Let it go down.
And whatever Petrov has on it?
We're doing the right thing, Cathy.
You got what you wanted, Viktor.
The boat is gone. Now let's get back to where we left off.
What will it take to get Aidan Macallan back on American soil?
He likes it here.
Leaving, Mr. President?
You can put that in the car, thank you.
  Are you all right?   Better now.
Are you drunk?
  You want a pull?   No.
I hate this place.
These men.
Their privilege, their presumption.
The deal with Tusk was a mistake.
Do you know...
Raymond wants to be frozen?
Put on ice until a later date.
  I have to get going.   Will Conway's my friend. But...
this won't end well for him if he wins.
You take care of yourself, Ben.
They have a recording of him.
I'll be right there in a minute.
You have to promise me
Will Conway never finds out this came from me.
You know I'm gonna be the president, right?
  I hope so, sir.   You hope so?
I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.
I'm gonna be the president,
and you're going to flip me those motherfucking controls.
Sir!
I think this must have been recorded by the pilot.
We should go to MSNBC and CNN first.
  We can go wide.   No, let's wait.
Francis, you heard what I heard.
And it'll be just as good tomorrow.
Have Doyle confirm it. I'll see you in the morning.
Why not do it now?
We need to wait for the president.
Stories are still swirling
around the events leading up to a daring Chinese-led rescue
of the crew of a Russian research ship
stuck in ice for almost four days
off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Although the ship was lost, every crew member was saved.
Russian President Viktor Petrov
expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government this morning.
Exhaustion must be catching up with the candidates,
as President Underwood and his running mate took the weekend off.
General Brockhart was nowhere to be seen,
while only Governor Conway
made a pair of quick appearances in the Cleveland area.
That tap water is gonna kill you.
There are worse ways to go.
I have a confession.
What'd you do?
I've had somebody watch you sometimes when you go to New York.
Her name's Karen.
Who is she?
I don't know you get to ask that.
She was my teacher.
Theology, among other things.
I don't know why I did that.
It's not... about jealousy.
She saved my life, actually.
I'm glad.
Well, we won't be seeing Karen for a while.
She knows me. She could see how I feel about you.
Ma'am, an initialed agreement.
What exactly was on that boat, Jane?
Uh, the Chinese and the Russians
had access to technology they shouldn't have
and didn't want to lose.
And now they've lost it.
What aren't you telling me?
What did you want out of all of this?
I told you what I wanted.
I wanted that American off the boat.
He was the technology.
Here, give me that.
Go.
Tom Hammerschmidt.
Detective, I got the drive.
Uh, no, I just put it in.
And... the time stamp says November rd, , : p.m.
Hold on a second.
You all right?
Yeah. I just need to get out for a minute.
I'm here.
I know. I know you're busy.
And I can't thank you enough, I...
Let me back you up a bit.
Okay, so this is two days before she died.
The governor sounds unhinged.
It bothers me, though.
It came too easy, don't you think?
Yes, but if we use it, we'll win.
I don't know, Claire. You know these types of people.
You should have been there.
Why would they hand me...
He just handed me this. Why?
When they've never wanted me, not from the beginning,
no matter what I do!
  Fuck 'em.   I intend to.
And how do you intend to do that?
I'm going back to work.
I'm going back to work.
We're glad you came.
I hear those weekends can, uh, take some recovery time.
I must say, I didn't expect to be back here so soon.
Well, Mark, we asked you back here because...
we've come into possession of a second audio recording
of your candidate on an airplane.
  He's been recorded saying...   I know what he said.
I was there.
So, we were wondering if we can discuss how...
we might be able to work together.
We can accomplish a great deal. The three of us.
Now, before you say anything,
let me tell you how this conversation's going to go.
You're going to talk about party loyalty,
and I'm going to talk about how weak your candidates are
and that you really have no choice.
And then you're going to say that your ticket can still win Ohio.
And I'm going to say, "No, they can't."
But what's going to go unsaid in this conversation
is that Claire and I...
are willing... to do anything.
And we know... that you are no different.
Okay, I can start by setting up some meetings for both of you.
I can't do that publicly, of course.
I suggest you release whatever you have slowly. One at a time.
Let's make this build.
Once it gets out,
I'll make sure the Republicans
don't come to my candidate's defense.
I was in a really bad place.
I couldn't do anything.
I couldn't leave my apartment.
Why?
It's mysterious, isn't it, when these things happen?
Or maybe it never happened to you.
But I woke up one day and it felt like...
everything I contemplated doing, everything,
from going to the coffee shop...
to... reading a book, writing a chapter, it was just...
laughable.
As in?
As in... pointless.
And Karen, bless her...
she helped me find a point. Or, not find one.
Realize the possibility of one.
Were you together?
Yeah. We were married.
For about three years. A million years ago.
She's a good person.
She's just... having a hard time. So I'm trying to help her.
Find a point?
You ever been that dark?
I wanna be with you.
I love you.
I think I might love you, too.
That's the script for the  second spot.
We don't wanna hit him too hard.
There's a risk of kicking him while he's down.
Who's doing the morning shows?
Friends. They'll respectfully question Conway's ability to serve.
And then in the nightly news,
we'll have veteran rights activists arguing for better care.
Good.
Sir, the plan is to go after the governor first,
and when the general comes to his defense,
we use his hot mic comments to take him down, too.
Congratulations, sir.
I wanted to be the first to say it.
We still have to campaign.
Yeah, but you're going to win.
We are, Doug.
We are.
Common woe, be done.House.of.Cards.SE
The general talked about killing the president.
That, along with Conway's outburst on the plane  
That sounds worse than it was.
No, that sounds exactly as bad as it was.
What's surprising to me is...
the campaign couldn't get their hands around this.
I mean, Harry Marshall is as good as they come, but  
First they denied, and then they equivocated  
I mean, that's just, like, ridiculous.
You just come out,
"I apologize. We misspoke."
Everybody knows the drill here.
And it's not like the Republicans rushed in
to save the day either.
  Off message throughout.   They got quiet.
Which I will never understand.
Will Conway was a rising star in the party.
Look, it's hard to compete with the Underwood machine.
God. Let's not do the whole "black helicopters" crazy stuff.
It's ridiculous.
Look, we need to accept Underwood won the election.
People need to accept the outcome and move on.
I'm gonna agree with Van.
I think we need to take a moment to appreciate the Constitution.
It bent,
  but it never broke.   That's right.
And in the end, as we all know,
it came down to the Electoral College.
You don't have to say the words, Governor.
I think I do.
Congratulations, Mr. President Elect.
There's no script for this one?
Country first, sir.
I'm glad to hear you say that, Will.
I want to start to help the country heal again.
Are we done?
We are done. But Will...
I would very much like to show the country
that our two parties can work together.
So I was hoping that you might consider
becoming my transportation secretary.
I think it would send a powerful message
if you agreed to join my cabinet.
You think I'd...
make a good... transportation secretary?
Yes.
That's what you give the congressman from nowhere.
I'll be declining.
Well, I'm so sorry to hear that, Will.
And I wanted to wish you the very best.
You and your wishes can go fuck yourselves!
What do I do now?
...everyone thought it would happen.
No one thought that Underwood would win again...
I don't know.
Acknowledging defeat is never easy.
Doing it in public is a living hell.
Well, at least the cameras like him.
Do I look satisfied?
You look somewhat satisfied.
  Good.   Not good.
Francis, enjoy this moment.
  You deserve it.   You mean "We."
We made it to the other side.
Yes.
But what is on the other side?
Victory.
With a whiff of defeat.
It's taken a long time to get here,
but we're here.
Cheers, Francis.
Everything gets easier from now on.
They're ready for you.
  Hannah.   I don't want to go.
No.
Fine.
I'll do it on my own.
I'm gonna say, this is a crucial moment.
For both of you.
How you handle tonight.
The party abandoned me.
Your party.
I'm not the Republican Party, Will.
I work for candidates.
I worked for you.
Listen, you lost.
But more than half the country
still considers you their president.
This is what's required.
Go down there, give your speech.
Concede.
As I accept all of your letters of resignation
and dissolve my old cabinet,
I wanna welcome each and every one of you to my new cabinet.
  Congratulations, Mr. President.   Thank you, Cathy.
And I especially wanna thank my wife.
Madam Vice President...
thank you for your unending and unwavering support.
Your steady hand kept this country running this past month.
I owe her more than I can possibly fathom.
And she owes me.
Not true. You were with me all the way.
I would like to make my first  days
as the duly elected president as productive as possible.
Of course, there are many challenges.
Shoring up the economy,
securing our nation from ICO
and reducing unemployment.
But the biggest challenge that we face,
and the one that I'm going to need all of your help on,
is reuniting a country
that has never been more divided than it is today.
I believe we can meet this challenge,
and that's where I'm gonna need all of your help.
So let's let the healing begin today
and let's make history together.
I thank you all for your continued service.
Now let's get back to work.
I need a minute.
I think we should see what we can do
about making Usher persona non grata.
I don't think that's wise to start a war.
We've just won the White House.
This is exactly when we should strike.
This is a moment that we have the political capital...
Usher needs to be managed carefully.
Mr. President?
Take a breath, Doug.
We've only just landed on our feet here.
Sir, Madam Vice President,
this is the type of person that we used to crucify in the House.
Yes, but we're not in the House now. We're here.
We have a full term ahead of us.
There's gonna be a great deal
that we're gonna be able to accomplish,
the three of us.
I appreciate that, sir.
But Mark Usher will become a problem.
Well, everyone becomes a problem, eventually.
LeAnn's out.
What?
Why?
She screwed up.
Well, is it something I need to get ready for?
The Underwoods want this handled indirectly.
So what exactly are we saying?
She's being pushed out.
Okay, but the campaign's over.
Is it necessary to say anything?
We need to distance this administration
from her and her work.
Her tactics.
So it needs to be a leak.
Reach out to the people who don't like us.
They'll be prime to go with it.
Okay, so when we respond...
  On the record or...   On.
What did she do?
She showed some very poor judgment.
I'm trusting you to be discreet.
We won, Seth.
Changes need to be made.
You know I'm off politics.
Surprised you reached out to me.
You're a highly-respected journalist.
Just here for the inauguration and the parties.
So I imagine you've heard that I'm on the outs.
They're not telling the whole story.
So what happened?
An acquaintance of mine
stole classified documents from the NSA
and took off to Russia.
They're blaming me for it.
What did this acquaintance take?
That's just the thing. I have no idea.
If you could find him, talk to him,
he would tell you that I had nothing to do with this.
Who is he? What's his name?
Aidan Macallan.
He'll talk to you. He respects you.
Tell him that I'm okay.
That I'm going to be okay.
I'm a firm believer in boots on the ground.
Well, we're there for the oil. Let's not pretend.
I'm not denying how crucial it is to protect the oil supply.
But it's in the world's best interest
that we're the ones keeping an eye on it.
  On the world or the oil?   Both.
Well, that explains your strong interest in Antarctica.
I do focus on things and people.
I tend to get attached,
but I think it makes me better at what I do.
And what are you focused on now?
Petrov. Ahmed Al Ahmadi. To begin with.
I'm... I'm sorry.
I just...
I'll run this by you tomorrow.
Yes, tomorrow.
Sorry for the interruption.
He's one of our speechwriters.
Tom Yates has quite a reputation.
Well, if his books are any indication,
he has lived quite a life.
My father wore striped socks.
Do you think the president will be sympathetic to our agenda?
"Our agenda"? That's very presumptuous.
Well, there are regions in the world
that are important to our national security
and they have to be protected.
Would you like to join us at the inaugural ball?
Oh, no, I can't.
Something terrible always happens when I go to a party.
By the way, my husband is not managed by anyone.
  That's not what I'm asking.   Isn't it?
I'm asking for your help, Madam Vice President.
That is all.
Evening.
Oh, my God. Come in.
I'm sorry. Sit down, sit down.
Aren't we working out tonight?
I just don't think I'm gonna have the time for it.
But come sit for a minute.
If you're too busy, I understand  
No, no. Join me for a minute.
I want you to hear something.
"This is the dawn of a new era.
It's a time for peace.
A time to respect the past and embrace the future.
A time..."
Time to what?
"A time to hear all the voices.
For there is nothing more lonely...
or terrifying...
than feeling unheard."
What do you think?
It's interesting. I like it.
  This is for...   My inauguration, yes.
Where does it go from there? What do you say?
"America, I hear you.
Whether you voted for me or not,
I hear all of you."
Now, what do you think my great-great-great-grandfather
would think of all this?
Awesome.
  In the original sense of the word.   Yeah.
How long you in town for?
Leaving tonight, actually.
I thought you were here for the inauguration.
I got a tip I have to move on.
What's the tip?
We used to have a rule about shoptalk.
Did we?
Fair enough.
What's your read on LeAnn Harvey?
That she's hard to read. That's what I like about her.
You trust her?
Kate, come on.
You look tired.
I'm working eight days a week.
I mean, you always looked tired,
but now you look tired in a... not sexy way.
Sorry to disappoint.
I actually have to get back there in a minute.
It's little late to head back to the office, right?
I've been there since last Tuesday.
Honestly...
I know this sounds weird...
There's no place I'd rather be.
The way you say that sounds so... rote.
I don't know...
What am I supposed to say to that?
I just want to know how you're doing, that's all.
I'm just asking about you, this person I'm sitting with.
Where'd you go, Tom Yates?
I was looking for you.
Not very hard, then.
I need to talk to you.
Okay.
I'm done.
With the speechwriting, I don't want to do it anymore.
I want to get back to some other stuff I was working on.
No offense. I mean, I know writing speeches is writing...
but it's not what I really wanna do.
Okay.
You sure?
Yes.
We'll transition you out.
But you'll need to have a reason to be here.
Special advisor? Are you kidding me?
There's speculation that he's already
It's not speculation, Seth.
People know that Mark Usher is working for us in some capacity.
  I mean, isn't that enough?   Clean up this release.
Uh, reaching across party lines, that sort of thing.
  And get it ready, just in case.   Of course.
That's it.
I know you're not happy about this.
What has he done to earn the title?
This is not about him earning anything.
He's already getting classified memos.
Why does she want this?
"She"?
I'm sorry. The vice president.
What she wants is for this administration to succeed.
And what I want is for you to befriend him. Get to know him.
We want him to think he's managing us
while we're busy managing him.
She has been pursuing Francis Underwood for a long time.
  I don't wanna talk to her.   Aidan...
How does she even know I'm here?
Miss Baldwin is a very good journalist.
Yeah, going public will not help you, or me.
You'll tell her how you manipulated the American mood, hmm?
  How you helped steal an election.   That would be it for me.
You're a valued guest of the Russian state.
I want my passport back.
An American passport is the last thing that will keep you safe.
I'll take my chances.
This will make you famous, hmm? A whistle-blower.
I don't wanna be famous.
But you do want to be free.
You spent  , at The Capital Grille?
What the fuck are you eating?
  This is Romero using the House Ethics...   It's a liability.
And you should know better.
How did you not disclose this, Terry?
I want to pull him off his committee assignments.
Put him on Science. See how he likes NASA briefings.
I'd like to hold off on that.
Romero's about to become an ally to the president.
And why's that?
Because he was able to find out about your tab.
It's because he's relentless.
Because in four years,   of the vote in Arizona will be Latino.
Because he's the future.
This is how it starts.
I gotta get back to the Hill.
You know, Doug...
you and I, we've been around long enough to see the guard change.
And it changes because the people at the top
forget how they got there.
Romero's trying to change the guard, Doug.
And we are the guard.
If Congressman Womack has nothing to hide,
he has nothing to fear.
We all have something to hide, Congressman Romero.
It's time for a change in the leadership.
The president would like to be a friend to you,
but you're making it very difficult.
We can guarantee the immigration ban
will be lifted in the next week.
Come on. Are we doing this again?
You offer me some racist gesture.
And I, what? I'm a friend forever? Ban isn't even sustainable.
What matters to you?
  The president's attention.   You have it.
  His full attention...   You know, that's enough.
What is it that you really want?
I want Medicare coverage bumped up to where it was.
There are retirees in my district.
We're here now because you want a bump in Medicare?
Come on, Congressman.
And two seats to the inauguration.
  We are two days out.   On the dais.
You are going about this entirely wrong.
You came here. You asked me.
I'm telling you.
I want to be there when Francis Underwood says to me
that there will be an increase in Medicare.
He does that, I'm his friend.
Well, I think I speak for the president
when I say that's not going to happen.
Mr. Stamper, I really appreciate all the work you do for him,
but you and I know that my bloc is growing.
All I'm looking for is a line in his address.
Two seats and a line.
  The balls on him.   I told him it was highly doubtful.
I can get back to him with a firm no.
Or you could give him a line.
His promises are unreliable.
Look, I know Alex. We met on Conway's campaign.
Once he's in, he's in.
Sir, we have to be very careful with what we're giving away.
He's capable of giving this administration
an enormous amount of grief.
He's asking for a gesture.
Oh, I'd say it's a little more than that.
I completely agree. He's going after the people who got us here.
He's not wrong, is he?
There are some in leadership whose time has come and gone.
Look... I'm just here to make sure
your four years turn into eight, but...
it's up to you, of course.
But we're talking about two seats... one line...
Give him what he wants.
Alex.
Tilda. It's lovely to see you.
  How are you, Congressman?   Oh, I'm fine.
It's good of you all to be here. It's a big day.
Listen, why don't the two of you take my seats?
Oh, thanks, but we're already on the aisle.
I insist.
You'll be right in the president's line of vision when he...
says what you want to hear.
Please. I can be anywhere.
Okay.
  Thank you, Mark.   Sure.
I, Francis J. Underwood, do solemnly swear...
I, Francis J. Underwood, do solemnly swear...
That I will faithfully execute...
That I will faithfully execute...
The office of President of the United States.
The office of Pres   Yes, here we go again.
Secretary of State. That's what I wanted.
That's all I wanted. That's what I was promised.
And now, here I am,
President of these United States.
You made this bed, America.
You voted for me.
Are you confused?
Are you afraid?
Because what you thought you wanted is now here.
And there you are, staring back,
slack-jawed, bewildered,
wondering if this is what you actually asked for.
This democracy, your democracy, elected me.
And if you think it was hard getting here,
you're beginning to understand what I'm willing to do to stay.
I look across at this crowd gathered today
and I know that these are not my supporters.
I'm looking at people who are waiting,
with a smile on their face, for their turn.
And the most vicious among them
are the ones who are smiling and clapping the hardest.
Power is a lot like real estate. Remember?
  So help me God.   So help me God.
America, I hear you.
I hear all your voices.
I hear your struggles, your concerns,
but most of all, I hear your hope.
Opportunity and security is what we all want.
And in my first  days, I will reach across party lines
and devote my administration, your government,
to securing them.
For too long we have ignored
our seniors and the healthcare they depend on.
That is why I am committed to fixing Medicare
before I devote one more dime to the program.
AmWorks was only the beginning.
We have to learn to live without entitlements,
because we are not an entitled people.
I believe in your sweat. I believe in your hard work.
And a job, that's what I'll promise you today.
You couldn't give him one line?
We give no quarter to those that are disloyal.
The message sent today wasn't just for him.
  Alex feeds off of retribution.   So do I.
  Is he worth the fight?   There is no neutrality.
I expect total loyalty or you are an enemy.
Understood, Mr. President.
What are you thinking?
 Let mortal tongues awake 
 Let all that breathe partake 
 Let rocks their silent break 
I have a soft spot for that patriotic stuff.
Please spread your arms and legs.
Excuse me?
Otherwise, there is no interview.
And if you would please take off your jacket.
  I'm a journalist.   I know.
I read you when I was living in London.
  So I'm not a spy.   I know you're not a spy.
Does anyone even use that word anymore?
So the interview won't be happening here.
  Uh, we agreed...   We need to move you to another location.
Oh, and I'm sorry, you cannot use your own crew.
  That's unacceptable.   Then the interview will have to wait.
We cannot trust your people.
And you wouldn't want to endanger Mr. Macallan, would you?
Are you coming, Miss Baldwin?
And your cell phone needs to stay here.
Thank you.
You have a lot of support out there,
no matter what the president did or didn't say.
There are people eager to work with you.
I should tell you...
I'm encouraging the Republicans
to restart the Declaration of War Committee,
to investigate the president.
That's bold.
  I'm not trying to impress you with that.   It's risky.
You don't want an enemy in the White House.
But you're in the White House now.
And you're what to me?
Why don't you let me help you?
Everybody doesn't have to lose for you to win, right?
Is Sean Jeffries there?
  Who's calling?   Who's this?
I work for Tom Hammerschmidt.
I don't understand why I was transferred to you.
The receptionist is a friend of mine. I know him. She knows him.
Well, I've been trying to reach him all day.
I can take a message.
No, I'll try him later.
Look, he doesn't work here anymore, so...
  I'm his girlfriend.   That's all right.
  Who is this?   Don't worry about it.
Hey, it's Seth Grayson. I've got something for you.
LeAnn Harvey, she's being pushed out.
Yeah, she's out.
Yeah, well, you're the only one
that's got me telling you at this point.
Okay. I'm writing the release right now.
All right, bye.
Hey, it's Seth Grayson.
Yeah, I got something for you.
Kate Baldwin's people were ready to go,
but the FSB replaced the crew.
You have something on your tooth.
Do we know where they were going?
No, but they're still being tracked.
Kate Baldwin was never supposed to talk to him.
  This interview cannot happen.   We still have time.
No, we don't.
We need to go in.
And there might be some unforeseen consequences.
I don't think Aidan would reveal anything
that would endanger me... or anyone else.
How far back do you and he go?
Far.
That's all.
I'm sorry it has to end this way.
I don't need your sympathy.
You almost ready?
God damn it. I can't find my "F."
Someone must have stolen it.
I'm sure it will turn up somewhere.
Tom, you look very handsome in a tuxedo.
I act like a man that can wear a tuxedo
and suddenly I'm a man who can wear a tuxedo.
This should do for now.
  I just saw that Eric Rawlings arrived.   Yes.
Tom, we'll meet you downstairs in just a few minutes.
Sure.
Stamper tells me that we'll have a bead on Macallan's location
in about an hour or so.
I just spoke to Jane Davis. Her contacts are ready and waiting.
We'll have distance, Francis.
We'll owe her.
You look very beautiful. Presidential.
You look beautiful. Vice Presidential.
Here we are. The night of Zoe's death.
Who does that look like to you?
Just another white guy waiting for the train.
Look closer.
I know who you think it might be, but... I'm really not sure.
Yeah, shut that door.
Gerald Ford's son used
to sneak up these stairs to go to the roof,
play Led Zeppelin to his friends.
Teenagers are teenagers, doesn't matter where.
And this... is
where Viktor Petrov put out his cigar.
That guy seems like a real piece of work.
Oh, believe me, he is.
So are you.
No, I don't know about that.
  What are you doing?   Oh, I'm sorry.
And what are you sorry about?
I thought you wanted something that you don't.
So what is it that you think I wanted?
We can go back up. I'm... I'm really s...
You know, they say the most vulnerable part of the human body...
is the throat...
and that you never really know how you feel about somebody...
until they have their hands around your throat.
So tell me.
How do you feel now?
Congratulations, Mr. President.
Before I forget, LeAnn Harvey wanted me to say hello.
How is she?
Well, she wanted me to tell you
that she's... she's all right. She's gonna be all right.
What does that mean?
She's, um, taking a leave of absence.
Well, that's what they're calling it,
but it... it seems that
she's being pushed out of the administration.
She's the one who told me you were here.
Suggested I talk to you.
LeAnn hired you, isn't that right?
Friend of the family?
Yeah, um, are we starting the interview now?
No, no. We're just talking. But we should be ready soon.
I'm sorry. Can I, uh...
Can I just have a second before we start?
  I think so. Sure. Um...   Okay.
Yeah. I'm... I'm gonna need some air.
No, I just... I just need a second, okay?
Of course. Get some air.
Okay.
I want your phone.
I need your phone. Take this.
One call.
One.
Hello?
LeAnn, it's me.
My God, Aidan.
I know you're in trouble. Here's the plan.
All right. Get a pen. Write down this number.
He... he's a lawyer. He can get you out of the country.
Once you're in Russia, I can protect you.
I'm sorry.
Why?
How long do I have before they come and get me?
They're right outside.
And if I run?
Uh, people will get hurt. You don't want to do that.
I like Texas.
Maybe it's the sun or the dust,
but people kind of squint when they say hello.
I always liked that.
I never should've left.
You've always been very good to me.
I liked your mother.
I liked her a lot.
I'm really sorry.
Don't be.
There's a guard on the second floor working with us.
He'll escort you to a corner where a cab will be waiting.
Someone will open the door. Just...
get in.
So you don't miss Texas?
No, I do.
I'm trying to find some peace with this
and you're not helping.
  Just a couple more questions.   I'm moving, you know.
  I got a new job...   Mr. Barnes?
They ruled your daughter's death an accident.
I am starting to doubt that.
  Could we just go over one or two more...   You know what?
I just can't keep doing this.
Stop calling me, please.
The interview will not be happening.
Someone will escort you back to your hotel.
Mr. President.
I hope I'm not too late to the party.
I'd say you were just in time to make your grand entrance.
Well, when all this started, I don't think I imagined myself
standing here with you tonight.
  Congratulations, Mr. President. Again.   Oh, thank you.
Um, should I wait for you?
No, no. I'll see you inside the party.
So... how's Romero?
Well, Romero wants to get the Republicans
to restart the Declaration of War Committee.
What a lovely inauguration gift.
Don't tell me you're surprised.
I'm not.
I'll see you inside. Get a drink.
Well, don't you look stunning.
It's been a long night, Frank.
I need to get home.
Come on. Do me the honor.
Not tonight.
Doug! Don't you look good.
Thank you, Madam Vice President.
Have you seen Francis?
Not for a little while, no, ma'am.
Well, the party's breaking up.
I want him to say goodbye to people.
  Yes, ma'am. I'll let him know.   Doug?
I have a question for you. Just a small thing.
  What is it?   Why weren't you at the beheading?
  What?   The night James Miller was beheaded.
We were all there, the four of us.
Francis, Tom, LeAnn and myself.
Why not you?
You see Francis, tell him I'm looking for him.
Yes, ma'am.
I thought you got lost.
No. I just needed a break.
Shall we bid our guests farewell?
No, the night is young.
Look what I found.
They're restarting the committee.
I thought we killed that committee.
Nothing ever really dies in the House.
It just plays in front of a smaller and smaller audience.
  This is serious.   I know.
But let's enjoy the rest of the party.
What do you do here?
I work for them.
The president asked me to make sure that you get home safely.
I have a car for you.
I thought I'd stay a little while longer.
The president has an early morning tomorrow.
Right this way.
The tour guide?
  What?   Yes.
WTF. What am I supposed to do about the tour guide?
The press briefing room, Tom, really?
I didn't think anyone would care.
Well, should I... keep her on or let her go?
I mean, it was rather unprofessional on her part.
She's good at her job.
Tom...
don't cheat on my wife.
Mr. Barnes?
Do you want to get a coffee somewhere away from this?
I keep thinking about what you said.
I found this with her things.
It was Father's Day...
the last time I heard from her.
We weren't close.
I was surprised she called.
I mean, I was happy, of course, but...
Can I hold on to this?
I didn't know...
that she was in trouble.
When the police asked if i thought she was suicidal,
I said, "Maybe."
I didn't know her, really.
Neither did I.
I'll look into this.
Okay.
Thank you.
Politico. Five minutes on Morning Joe.
Was a press release really necessary?
You're taking a leave.
The press release said that you were taking a leave
to consider your career options.
This has to look real. You know that.
What if they need to meet with me?
Then they'll meet with you.
I could have security escort you out.
So since Usher is special advisor now,
where does that leave you?
Like I said, they'll call you if they need you.
I can be a friend to you, you know.
It doesn't have to be like this.
I don't have any friends.
I landed him at the Jordanian Embassy in Paris.
When do we plan to get him out?
Well, as I understand it, you don't yet know
what Mr. Macallan may have told President Petrov.
I want Macallan back here sooner rather than later.
It's better if these things don't happen on American soil.
Yes, but I make those decisions.
Of course, Mr. President.
And rest assured,
neither of your fingerprints are anywhere near this.
So what do we do about LeAnn?
She's been involved in election fraud, for Christ's sake.
She's made a lot of mistakes.
Yes, but lots of people have.
Yes, but some people run their course.
It's hard to know who to trust these days.
Isn't it?House.of.Cards.SE
The dead sleep with their eyes open, my grandfather would say.
They're watching you from the past...
Jackie Sharp.
Romero wasted no time.
What good are you?
You Democrats are full of surprises.
Her lawyers won't let us get anywhere near her.
Because they're negotiating her testimony.
How the hell did we get here?
Romero was privy to information. Someone from within the party.
He's threatening to go after her for whipping votes
in exchange for campaign funds from a Mr. Remy Danton,
who, shockingly, she was sleeping with.
Well, she's not testifying because of an affair.
She's testifying 'cause she doesn't want to go to jail.
Which is the only reason anyone testifies.
Doug, keep at the rest of the Democrats on that committee.
Make sure they stay in line.
I'll keep working my side of the aisle, but... uh, Romero.
He's a prick.
Mmm-hmm, prick who still wants whip.
Terry Womack has been very loyal.
Yeah, well, there's loyal, and then there's good.
What has Womack brought you?
Did he kill the Declaration of War Committee?
Did he deliver Missouri for you in November?
That's enough.
Let's give it to him.
Look, sometimes you have to make hard choices.
I'll talk to Terry.
Romero's gonna have to find a place for him to land, and...
where that is matters to me.
That'll be all for now.
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna put Doyle on this.
We already vetted Romero.
No, I mean on Usher.
The body is remarkably well-preserved,
except for the extremities, which frostbite took care of.
But dental is intact.
Our counterparts in Antarctica are cooperating fully,
and the body will be in our possession within the next  hours.
I'll have it in transit after customs.
We'd like the body to get lost in transit.
Ma'am?
It needs to get lost.
Yes.
Okay. Thank you, Assistant Director Green.
Uh, keep in touch.
  I thought you'd gone to bed.   Can't yet.
  Who's that?   No one we know.
Tom, I said it's no one we know.
You ever hear about the , year-old man they found
frozen in the Italian Alps?
No.
His skull was caved in... from the back.
He probably never saw it coming.
Beaten and left for dead.
Left for dead is an ancient concept.
You know, when you freeze to death...
the last thing you feel is extreme heat.
That hurts.
Sorry.
I saw Francis out there.
He seems on edge.
Can you blame him?
Better?
Shoplifting is the worst of it.
A couple of recent street buys that led to court-mandated rehab.
That's where she lives, where she works, where she scores...
But all I see here is a woman in her s, trying to get to .
  She's a concern.   I don't get it.
She was in touch with Gavin Orsay before he left for Venezuela.
  Doug...   Nathan!
There's a bite to your tone that we might need to discuss.
She's a loose end and an addict.
That's a bad combination.
It's a clean slate.
Donald Blythe's taste was a bit too dark for me,
so I stripped it all back.
I have chosen one painting so far that's on its way, though.
Thad Peterson's body is taken care of.
His name is John Doe.
I'd recognize him anywhere.
This would've been very embarrassing to some interests
that are important to this country.
And I wouldn't want the family to see him this way.
What's the news from the Jordanian Embassy?
Aidan Macallan still won't
reveal what he did or didn't tell Petrov.
Well, the president wants him brought back from his asylum
to the United States immediately.
I think we should give it a little more time.
You know, I wonder if it was such a good idea to bring you in on this.
  You promised     I know. Ahmadi...
We've got Special Forces on the ground, tracking.
Russia's presence in Syria
is making this more difficult than I once thought.
I need to know what Macallan told Petrov.
It never ceases to astonish me
how talented men are at making a mess.
Uh, it's not gonna serve you to go after your own party.
You never stop.
Jackie Sharp will never testify.
Well, then she'll go to jail.
You can't prove it, Alex. You can't prove the quid pro quo.
She seems to think I can.
If you play it a little differently,
you have a chance to get what you want.
We're offering you whip.
  I don't want it anymore.   What?
Jesus Christ.
Ways and Means, then.
The keynote at the next convention.
What I want is for Francis Underwood to go to jail.
My God. How is that gonna help you?
Really? How's it gonna help you?
There's another way to go at it.
Wanna make a name for yourself?
You wanna make the president's life a living hell?
Draw it out.
Keep the committee going but at a slow burn.
Aren't you working for him?
Members of the administration, you bring 'em in one at a time.
You could ride this for a couple of years and secure your place.
While you keep the president in check.
Don't end it before it's begun by calling Jackie Sharp.
You know I see good things for you.
Let me plan out your next eight years.
The candidates you worked with...
how many of them have
waited and waited and lost their moment?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm reading the moment, and this is mine.
Let me out on Third Street.
I'll drop you at Rayburn.
No, I always walk the final  yards.
Never know when you might get a chance to press some flesh.
Yeah.
Hi, I'm Alex Romero.
I represent the Seventh District of Arizona.
I want to know what keeps you up at night,
so I can work all day to address it.
The future belongs to all of us.
I hope I can count on your support.
What do you think, Mark?
I mean, you're the expert.
Right here.
Romero said no, and the usual offers don't interest him.
Oh, he's interested. He just hates himself for it.
I am making headway with the Republicans on the committee.
They all have pasts, most of them have witnesses.
One way or another, Jackie Sharp won't be testifying.
So why are you having so much trouble
with this one young congressman?
He's tenacious.
He reminds me of you.
Well, I don't see that at all. We'll talk later.
I could reach out to Danton  
We expose him, he'll expose us.
Well, then what do you suggest?
That I go on being presidential.
That's the only way that I can deal with this.
It's my first  days, for God's sake.
Francis...
we're going to get our hands on Ahmadi.
There aren't enough Ahmadis in the world.
Not for all we've done.
Then what?
Destroy Romero, for one. Can we at least take care of that?
And then who? The rest of the Democratic Party?
I know what I'm doing, Claire. I've been president before.
So have I.
Get me Terry Womack.
Your job as vice president is to advise.
My job is to make the decisions.
Terry, yes, I'm just checking in.
Well, I want you to know that we support you.
That bastard asked for whip, but that's never gonna happen.
Not while I'm in this office. I wanted to assure you.
I've always tried to help where I can.
And you couldn't help at Health and Human Services?
The agency does some amazing work.
Well, you were quoted as, uh, calling your position a dream job.
It's possible to have more than one dream.
I can have my assistant give you a tour.
Uh, show you some of the video from Haiti
and some of the work that we've been doing there
over the last several months.
I will be sure to include
your organization in the piece I'm writing.
  I believe in the work you're doing here.   Thank you.
What was it like, uh, working with the Underwood administration?
They were fine. Let's leave it at that.
You know, I've met with, uh, many wonderful organizations so far.
  The Virginia Children's Defense Fund.   They do some great work.
The Talbot League?
Another terrific group.
The Anthony Moretti Memorial Fund.
I don't know anything about them.
Organ transplantation awareness.
Oh, is that right?
I'm so sorry.
It's rude, but I was famished.
Thank you for meeting me. Let me get you a menu.
Uh, no, thank you. I have a lunch right after this.
Good. You should always have one on the books.
  Miss Davis?   You're worried about Aidan.
Do you call him anything for short?
Why would you ask me that?
I don't know if the president, or vice president,
has informed you, but Mac is fine.
It's what he knows is the problem,
and who he may have told it to.
He wants to stay alive.
Yes.
But those are the ones you have to watch out for.
Last I spoke to Aidan was minutes before he got in a cab.
I don't know what he has or what he's done.
I only do what I'm told.
I'm in the Hoover Building.
It's the ugliest building in... in the city.
I close my eyes as I walk in.
Stop by any time. Especially if you're in the mood to talk.
We could use someone who says as little as you do.
Lisa!
  I've been looking for her.   I have no idea where she is.
  Let me help you with that.   No. No, I'm okay.
  I'm happy to carry it for you.   You're scaring me.
I'm just worried about her. That's all.
I'm clean.
Good.
At least I'm trying to get clean. Please leave me alone.
Just...
If you hear from Rachel, just, uh...
tell her I've taken care of everything.
She can come home and everything will be fine.
I miss her, you know?
I'm sorry.
You going to answer that?
So, was I right?
Your phone is ringing.
You know, you can just hang it up by pressing the button on the side.
  You don't have to decline     I'm a creature of habit.
So, yeah, you were right.
This phone has only been used once to call one number, once.
I mean, I used the manufacturer's serial number
and tracked down where it's distributed to.
It was a, um... A shop in Dupont Circle.
And who did it call?
Comes up unknown.
But the prefix...
And, look, you're gonna have to talk to the police or the FBI.
  I just can't keep     Don't worry. It's on me.
The prefix on the call, it looks like a government number to me.
Hello.
He followed you? When?
  I've got to...   Yeah.
Okay. Okay, if you feel safe where you are,
stay there. I'm coming to you.
So what couldn't you tell me over the phone?
Jackie Sharp.
What about her?
You really don't know?
I thought this was coming out of the White House.
The story's about to break
that she traded legislation for campaign funds.
The source?
So, unconfirmed.
It's going to be on Drudge within the hour.
You really don't have anything to say?
If it's true, it's just sad to see the unexpected fall
of a once rising star in the Democratic Party.
Stop it.
Sharp would've been a get for the committee.
If you're still willing to appear, we're still willing to talk.
See ya.
This is not how we do things in this administration.
You wanted her not to testify.
And there's no way Romero can force her to now.
You've put my press secretary
and his staff in a very difficult situation.
It was a leak, and it didn't come from you.
I really felt this was the way to get ahead of it.
This is getting ahead of it?
I guarantee you her lawyers
tell her to plead the Fifth now, across the board.
Most importantly, where it concerns you.
But all of this happened while I was negotiating with Petrov.
Oh, to the public, you were the First Lady,
sitting vigil by your husband's bed.
So, actually, all of this happened under Donald Blythe's watch.
I'm sorry if you think I overstepped.
I was trying to protect you.
He did the right thing.
Oh, I don't mind what he did.
I mind the way he did it.
  LeAnn...   Madam Vice President.
I'm sorry my schedule is so full.
No, I completely understand,
with everything that you're dealing with.
I'm sorry for being so insistent,
but I thought you should
know that Jane Davis came after me yesterday.
Came after you?
She wanted me to work for her. I didn't know if you knew.
In what capacity?
That, I'm not clear on, but it...
She wanted information about Aidan Macallan.
I hope you know I would never say a word.
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
Ma'am, I was hoping we could discuss my future.
Oh, LeAnn, I would love to discuss your future, but not yet.
If you would like, ma'am, I can help with Aidan.
Anything that's required.
That's good to know.
Did you think LeAnn Harvey wouldn't tell me?
I never assume what people will do or won't do.
  I thought we were working well together.   We are.
Well, going around me to get information
will only create discord between us.
I wouldn't want that, Claire.
  Miss Davis.   Mr. President.
I'm sorry I'm late.
The vice president has told me that your contacts
have once again lost track of Ahmadi.
Yes, as I explained,
Syria is like a different country one day to the next.
Yes, well, you can thank Viktor Petrov for that.
Oh, I do.
Ma'am?
Oh, you'll have to excuse me, Jane.
The schedule is crazy these days.
Oh, of course.
Really? The State Department, the Pentagon,
we can't get close to Ahmadi?
I just want peace.
Yes, there's nothing that makes profits like peace.
And nothing makes peace like profits.
Mr. President, may I be blunt?
Well, I would never accuse you of dullness, Miss Davis.
There's going to be a gas attack happening in the city of Homs.
If you were to, let us say, draw a line in the sand...
and if this tragic attack were to happen...
the US government would have
to send in an additional , or so soldiers.
To protect the oil lines,
to keep Petrov from getting into Damascus.
And, of course, to protect the people.
That's venturing close to occupation with those kind of numbers.
All I'm saying is maybe the Declaration of War Committee
could finally debate what they were mandated to.
A war.
Do you know Mark Usher?
Yes, we worked together.
He was handling a congressman.
Mark.
Has anyone offered you anything?
Oh, no, I'm good. Thanks.
Have you ever worked with Jane Davis?
Davis is the stepfather's name.
A one  term senator.
Uh, anyway, yeah, she was
interested in a client I had, at some point.
A candidate for Congress.
Poor guy. The minute Usher realized he wasn't formidable enough,
he just dumped him. Let him go.
But that's Mark.
He has an eye for talent.
Likes to keep you close while he keeps himself remote.
But he disagreed with some of her positions,
the money went away.
Listen, don't let Jane fool you.
She can seem a bit... haphazard...
But once he's done with you...
it's as if a switch gets turned off.
But she is merciless.
Single-minded as a single mind can be.
What? Forgot to eat today.
What have you got for me?
  I don't know.   Don't do "I don't know."
Saw Meredith Lee.
I mentioned the Moretti Fund, organ transplants, uh...
She got a little tense, but... I don't know.
Why didn't you tell me you were fired?
  Oh, that was you?   Who talked to your girlfriend? Yeah.
How long?
What's the difference? I'm tapped.
What are we doing here?
I don't like eating in my car.
I think Laura Moretti's husband
was jumped on the donor list.
  Where the hell did you get that?   My gut.
I can lay it out for you.
Yeah, you say something like that, you better.
Sarin gas. Mostly against civilians in suburban areas of Homs.
  We're dealing with animals here.   It's horrifying.
Now, you know I've always shown restraint in the past, but...
I'm going to be making an executive order for military action.
Air strikes followed by ground troops.
You'll need to present to the UN.
Where is this intelligence coming from?
Well, it's all there in the briefing.
But if we know this is going to happen,
well, then why aren't we stopping it before it does?
Francis held on to your resignation letter.
And he wants to tear it up.
I know how difficult these past few months have been for you.
We've really asked a lot.
Once we're on the other side of this military action,
you have our blessing to leave the administration if you choose.
But, of course, we'd prefer if you stay on.
Hope that goes without saying.
Using weapons of mass destruction
against civilians is a war crime.
I appreciate the opportunity to see this through to the end.
We were hoping you would say that.
Thank you, Cathy.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Are you worried about her?
We need to start thinking about
the people we surround ourselves with.
Which has made me think of Tom...
who doesn't really have a reason to be here anymore, does he?
Not an official one, no,
but I thought maybe we could bring him on as a consultant.
Well, of course, that's entirely up to you.
There's just only so much time and energy in a single day,
and I think we need to constantly be asking ourselves,
"Am I spending it as wisely as I can?"
  Thank you.   Jane, I'm so sorry
  to pull you away from your party.   No, no, no.
  When I heard your voice on the phone...   I just... I just...
  I don't know what to do.   Did something happen?
The Underwoods are planning
air strikes and a troop surge in Homs.
  How awful.   Do you know anything about this?
Petrov is making the whole region a disaster.
No one who ever got tangled up in the Middle East came out ahead.
Let Petrov own it.
There's something terrible that is going to happen...
that we can prevent.
I see.
I'm scheduled to present some kind of red line at the UN.
  But we can still pull back.   How can I help?
Talk to the president, the vice president.
I will.
They're terrible, terrible people, aren't they?
Jane...
be very careful with them.
Of course.
That's from an old friend.
Are we still friends?
Of course.
He says the liver the president received
was supposed to go to a man named Anthony Moretti.
And he says that Doug forced
then Secretary of Health and Human Services
to put the president at the top of the list,
which resulted in Moretti's death.
Oh, and Doug also has become involved with the man's widow.
That's a nice touch.
And does... does he have proof?
About the relationship? It's easy to prove that.
But the list, he knows that Meredith Lee is hiding something.
And he's ready to go back and talk to her about it.
Do you trust him?
I don't know why he'd make any of this up.
Hey, I'm outside.
Did you have a good time?
I never do at those things anymore.
Necessary evils.
It's not like the old days,
when you used to meet surprising people.
Did people get less surprising
or are we less easily surprised?
Well, exactly.
  This is me.   She asked me about you.
  I figured. What'd you say?   That you're...
formidable, etcetera.
Yeah, I told him the same about you, etcetera.
He could be a great president.
But does he want to be?
And what is great?
And then there's her.
What about her?
What about her?
Because if Bob or Terry were the ranking member,
I'd be talking to them.
I want Romero's clerk stripped.
Yeah, whatever budget he's got for his seat on that committee.
No, no, I'm asking for the sake of the party.
Look, we survived Jackie Sharp, but it's not gonna end there.
The truth is I'm being punished
for fighting for the issues that our base cares most about.
Yes, and thank you.
Doyle says there's almost nothing on Usher.
He likes to gamble, usually wins.
But here's the thing... Doyle spoke with Marshall,
who we know did not have a happy exit from the Conway campaign.
Now, he said that before Usher joined our administration,
he was grooming Romero for a presidential run.
Sir, I believe he's playing
both sides of whatever this committee is after.
I'm not a Democrat, Jeffrey.
I'm still a Republican, just happen to work for the White House.
All I'm saying is let's rein Alex in while we still can.
'Cause after he rips through his own party,
he'll come after ours, wouldn't you think?
Yeah, and Jeff, you're the chair...
No... What? No, listen.
Wait. Wait! Wait.
And you owe me, and we both know it,
and that's not the kind of thing I like to say out loud.
What is?
When did that happen?
Confirmed?
Yeah?
Yes, well...
just because Walker's gonna take the stand,
doesn't mean he'll say anything. Right?
What was that word you said to me this morning?
The one no one uses anymore?
Crepuscular.
Right.
Some of my favorite animals are crepuscular.
Yes.
What?
When?
Jesus! God damn it!
Claire!
  Claire!   I'm in the kitchen.
Walker's gonna testify.
  When?   Early as next week.
He's gonna say the same thing he said to Hammerschmidt.
There's not gonna be any new damage.
  We don't know that for sure.   Let's get Usher.
You bet I'm gonna talk to him in the morning.
Where are you going?
To get some goddamn space in this house!
I can take care of Walker. We'll make him an offer.
A place back on the stage,
chancellor of some well-endowed university. He'll take it.
He just might. But first,
I want to know what you have on Romero.
I don't have a thing.
  Please.   Doug, let's not be rude.
I find that impossible to believe.
If I did, you would know it.
You and I have been at this a long time.
You wouldn't even consider a candidate without vetting him first.
I thought Alex had a future.
Yeah, a run for the presidency as I understand it.
He's clean and crisp as a starched white shirt.
You're gonna have to make a decision, Mark.
You wanna work for me and Claire, or not?
I have already reached out to members of my own party.
I've used my political capital to help you.
But you're still not answering my question.
I think I have.
And I don't need to convince you or Mrs. Underwood of my worth.
It's an honor to meet you.
Seth, Mr. Jeffries will catch up with you momentarily.
I'm going to keep this brief.
If what you're saying is true...
Doug Stamper saved my husband's life.
He did.
And he also cost someone else his.
Well, I suspect you're the kind of man that wants many things.
But you have made a mistake.
There's only one thing, professionally, that I've always wanted.
It's to work in the White House.
Seth will see you out.
Sorry for the interruption.
You were saying...
Cathy was always a very good person.
At her core, she has a core.
Bless her.
This whole Homs initiative might be too difficult for her.
You know... you're very hard to read.
Which makes sense.
For the last several years, you've been a familiar face.
Must get exhausting.
Must be hardly any people you can even share a laugh with.
You should figure out how to take full advantage of me.
I can help you get what you want.
If you tell me what it is.
I enjoy helping others.
I think you know what I want.
Yes...
But do you want it now or in four years?
I want the whole world to see Ahmadi's capture...
on every news outlet and every screen.
For the good of the party, I'd prefer Mr. Walker not testify.
I'm considering taking myself off the Declaration of War Committee.
Alex, you don't have to do that.
And you can do what you will with it.
But that's conditional on the president doing the right thing.
And what is that?
Resigning.
Again, I'm only thinking of the party.
Yeah...
Who the fuck do you think you are?
  Oh, don't use that language with me...   Shut the fuck up.
You have no idea, none, about what you're doing.
I'd like you to leave my office.
Now you listen carefully to me.
  I said...   Shut up, Alex!
Here's a headline for you.
"Alex Romero colluded with Governor Conway
to use the Declaration of War Committee
to help him win an election."
  No.   Please, you know you did.
  See how easy that is?   Get out!
You're gonna be all alone at your hearing. I just left Walker.
He's gonna plead the Fifth. You'll look like a fool.
You want to be out front? No one has a problem with that.
They want you there, because you'll be the first to fall.
"For the good of the party."
Sleep tight, Congressman.
  Who knows about Will?   No one, not yet.
What else?
Why I'm still protecting you at this point...
I don't even understand myself.
Walker's gonna plead the Fifth.
And Romero won't rock the boat.
Thank you, Mark, I appreciate that.
I would suggest you schedule a press conference
for right after the hearing.
All right.
Tell me the worst thing you've ever done.
It's hard to pick.
  I'm serious.   So am I.
Pretended to love someone when I didn't.
In a way, that was the worst.
Did the person know?
She pretended not to know...
but she knew.
It was awful for her.
But I paid for that mistake, too.
Those types of things, they take a toll.
It's strange how some choices mean nothing
and others govern the rest of your life.
I've done some terrible things.
You don't have to tell me.
Francis killed Zoe Barnes.
Claire.
Francis killed Peter.
Stop.
And so many more are gonna die.
Stop.
You don't scare me.
I should.
Aidan.
Not anymore.
How did you get here?
A door opened, I walked out.
That doesn't sound right.
I got a visa and a flight tonight. I just...
I just wanted to see you one last time.
Wait. Who's getting you out?
That doesn't matter.
  What did you say?   Honestly, nothing.
We have to talk to the Underwoods.
  Nah, I don't think so.   This does not make sense.
Well, you always liked to drive a nice car.
Aidan, come with me. I'll fix this.
You come with me. I've a way for you to get out.
Well, all right, then.
Now, don't you tell anybody you saw me until the morning.
Why would I tell anyone I saw you at all?
Really?
Wait.
  Here, take this.   No.
Come on. At least until you get on the flight, all right?
I'm out.
Can't sleep?
It's freezing out here. You should have a coat on.
I like it.
Don't meet with Walker.
I think it's a bad idea.
It'll remind him of his best course of action.
You're wrong. I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
Usher has it under control.
You always do what you want.
Tom doesn't want to leave.
Tom doesn't get to choose.
It's cold. You should go in.
If you could get me Doug Stamper's addresses
for the last three years...
And do you know what happened to the photo strip
of Rachel and Lisa?
It's gone.
We need to lay out our positions ourselves.
I'm already on my way to New York.
I don't want you to say or do anything
that makes you feel uncomfortable.
I won't contradict the administration. That's not my wish.
We need to draw a line in the sand.
Yes, of course. Should I get on my flight?
I think it might be best if you turn around and come back.
Whatever you think.
We'll let Walker plead the Fifth.
Then we'll regroup and make sure we're on the same page.
Okay. We need to head back.
"Beware entangling alliances," Mr. President.
You know, that quote is often attributed to Washington,
but it was actually Jefferson who said it.
Anyway, I wanted to catch you before,
Mark and your lawyer got here.
Mr. President.
I know this hasn't been easy for you.
Well, the truth is, one can get used to almost anything.
Well, at any rate, congratulations.
You're about to become the chancellor
of one of our finest universities.
It's a high price we pay for respectability.
Anyway, I just wanted to say hello.
And to thank you for all you're doing.
In not too long,
you're going to become one of those ex-presidents
whose work will make everyone... forget the past.
I was once the President of the United States.
Yes, you were.
You stole the presidency, Frank.
Now, Garrett...
This is ancient history,
but by modern political standards,
my election was a landslide.
I was gonna change this country.
But then... uh, things happen.
People lie...
You lie to keep up.
The things that you've been lauded for all your life,
those are suddenly fatal flaws.
People who've been with you through thick and thin,
who you thought would never fail you, they fail you.
You make strange alliances with unsavory people.
And it all becomes clear way too late.
And no one else truly understands.
Except someone who's been in the office...
You can't expect the office
to do anything more than what you bring to it.
  I'm doing this for the party.   I know.
And it's admirable.
How's Tricia?
Well, it's taken time, but we are good.
The kids are doing well.
Well, this is just the beginning.
You and I are gonna be working a lot more together from now on.
Is that so?
Doug.
Tom, it's a busy morning.
I don't have any quotes right now.
When you have a moment, i'd like to sit down
and ask you some questions about Lisa Williams.
I'm sorry. What are you talking about?
Let me know when you're free, Doug.
If you'd like a statement,
Seth Grayson's office will be issuing a press release shortly.
You live near Dupont Circle, don't you?
I will go on the record and say yes, I do.
President Walker,
it's been established in
Heather Dunbar's special prosecutor's report
that we have reason to  
Congressman, as I mentioned to the chair
and the other distinguished members of the committee,
I am advising my client to plead the Fifth at this time
for all questions regarding his tenure
as President of the United States of America.
I must say, uh, that as a fellow Democrat,
this is highly irregular.
Yes, Congressman, yes.
But in light of ongoing investigations  
Actually, I will answer the congressman's questions.
Please, ask your question.
Under your administration,
millions of dollars were illegally laundered
from Chinese businessmen to affect American elections.
Is this true?
Yes. That's true.
And can you tell us what, if any,
was then Vice President Francis Underwood's
involvement in this scheme?
Well, it appeared to me, he was one of its chief architects.
And, uh, what exactly do you mean by that, sir?
It was his idea.
Mark, I think you need to be elsewhere right now.
Are we gonna bury our heads in the sand with this?
No, you're going to leave,
and the vice president and I are going to decide what to do.
Walker reneged. We had a deal.
We will let you know if you are needed.
  Sir...   That was not a request.
Why did you have to go talk to him?
There has to be a way out, Francis.
Does there? Is there?
Or is this my presidency?
Forever with a target on my back.
Haunted and hunted.
LeAnn, if you're hearing this, it means that I'm dead.House.of.Cards.SE
Garrett Walker's testimony couldn't be more damning.
Francis Underwood is front and center in a scheme
that had Chinese money influencing an American election.
Testimony from a disgraced and disgruntled former president.
Why is he just speaking up now?
Well, are you suggesting that they shouldn't...
take what Walker said seriously? I mean...
If it's true, why stay silent so long?
Which is a question I'm sure
the Judiciary Committee will ask once it's up and going.
My sources say articles of impeachment could be voted on
as early as the end of the week.
Now as if the House is that efficient.
Look, President Walker is the one who should be scrutinized here.
He's talking out of both sides of his mouth.
And let's not forget,
he has had some emotional problems
  in the past.   Underwood has disrespected
the presidency since before he was thought of
  for Secretary of State...   You seem blinded by this crusade.
  ...when he was nothing more than the House Whip.   You guys, wait.
If Underwood is impeached, then...
That's a hypothetical. It's dangerous.
Fair. Well...
Tom, where would impeachment leave
Vice President Claire Underwood?
In the Oval, as president.
What their arrangement would be,
in that case, is anybody's guess.
Seth, what is this like right now for the first couple?
They're avoiding all of this distraction.
They're continuing to do the work of the American people.
  Censure.   No.
I see Mark's point.
There is no way to stop the Republicans in the House.
Walker's not a reliable witness.
Is what he said verifiable?
So, impeachment is inevitable.
Well, that's... that's a presumption.
The Democratic Senate
will not be inclined to remove a Democratic president.
But they need political cover.
Censure will help them with that.
I mean, they might propose other penalties,
a fine, a statement of condemnation
but they'll stop short of finding criminal wrongdoing.
And if it happens quickly, everyone can move on.
Did you two get together on this privately?
No.
Francis, this is one way to salvage your first term.
Walker was supposed to plead the Fifth.
Well, things took an unexpected turn.
Yes. He went back on his deal,
because he's as pliable as his testimony.
Mark, I will not be impeached in the House
and it will never get to the Senate.
We will destroy Garrett Walker's credibility
and the case will fall apart.
Okay.
Can I get immunity?
Depends on what you give them.
I'll reach out to a ranking member,
but you're not gonna get anonymity...
Cathy.
  Jane.   Hello?
You've been on my mind. Can you believe what's going on?
Excuse me for a moment.
As my mother used to say, "It's a red hot mess."
Frank Underwood's demise doesn't have to be yours.
There are non-profits,
NGOs that would be dying to work with you.
Well, as far as I know, I still have a job.
No, of course.
But who knows who they'll come after next?
I was never part of their inner circle.
You were smart to go with Maureen. She's a good lawyer.
If someone can find you an exit, it's her.
Well, I'm not gonna go away easily,
so thank you for your concern, Jane.
It is concern.
do you think the vice president
had any knowledge of this stuff?
Well, as I said, I have no idea.
If... if Claire survives this and becomes president,
where does that leave you?
Well, I've been at this for  years, Jane,
so I think I can survive.
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to alarm you.
I'm not alarmed.
All I'm trying to say,
I'm on your side.
If it's the difference in being in office or being out,
we can work around that.
Working in handcuffs.
Censure is a setback. It's not a loss.
You're very confident and very insistent.
We can come out of this, Francis.
No, you mean you can.
Can you, for once,
just take something at face value instead of fighting it?
As if I can be washed clean of past sins.
  How long have you known me?   Forever.
How well do you know me?
How, in your wildest imagination,
could you, Claire Underwood,
think I would be okay with this?
Think about it, please.
This is the fate of my presidency!
The people want to forgive you.
Let them.
Come out here already. Give me the rest of it.
Hammerschmidt is a straight-up workaholic.
But... he's getting close.
Putting the pieces together.
What's he still grinding so hard for?
Looks like Walker's gonna bring Underwood down.
I don't wanna do this anymore.
Zoe Barnes. Rachel Posner.
Sean, please, I...
I was the one trying to get him back on that.
  That's what got me fired.   Can we stop talking about this?
  Where's my drink?   Don't do that.
Look at me. Look.
This is me... not talking.
Come here. Come here.
But if I can be of any help, you let me know.
You're gonna get it.
Give me a taste of that.
Slow down.
Pull over!
You're going pretty hard, Mr. President. You okay?
Well enough for a man whose fate is hanging in the balance.
No.
Your fate is sealed.
Oh, how's that?
You have a vision for me, Eric?
Even if you're impeached and convicted...
you still make history.
Augustus Underwood was just another redneck
who died fighting for the wrong side,
forgotten by everyone but you and me.
But if Francis Underwood is removed from office?
Your legacy won't die.
It'll be solidified.
You'll be infamous.
Legacy and infamy are not the same thing.
You'll be remembered. Who cares why?
I have to get back.
Hold up. Let me explain.
Francis.
Francis.
Francis?
Just to be clear,
it's not that I haven't always known you were there.
It's that I have mixed feelings about you.
I question your intentions...
and I'm ambivalent about attention.
But don't take it personally.
It's how I feel about most everybody.
How can we trust anything he says?
Garrett Walker was medicated
while he was in office.
We all know that.
No, it's not a talking point. It's the truth.
We don't know exactly what he was taking.
Off the record...
can you tell me what Tom Hammerschmidt's working on?
Come on, you two don't cross paths over there?
He reached out to me on a story.
I never heard back.
Okay. Thank you.
You can believe what he's saying or not.
But Garrett Walker was taking serious medication...
Never... never put an unknown flash drive
into a networked computer. Never.
You don't have to keep telling me.
  I called you, remember?   Yeah.
Okay. Do your worst.
Okay. So far so good.
There is something.
Thank you.
I have to go.
Everything okay?
  Not now.   See you tonight?
I'll call you when I'm done.
I think there's a leak.
In the Underwood Administration.
No idea.
Well, no, that's a little premature.
This isn't Watergate... yet.
Yeah.
Okay.
Alex.
So... Judiciary won't be happening for you.
Just the few slots for Democrats.
Leadership just filled those
with a couple of old Blue Dogs. Sorry.
Well, you were right about one thing.
Garrett's testimony did not make me any friends.
Not in your party, no.
Well, as of this morning, I'm officially an independent.
I think the GOP can find me a place on judiciary.
  Okay, Alex.   It's a good move.
Four years from now,
I think an outsider's what the voter will be looking for.
Yeah, third-party candidate is the future,
and always will be.
Why did Garrett Walker change his mind?
It wasn't me who made that happen.
I don't know.
Sometimes things happen without us knowing why.
They arrested someone they knew was innocent.
  Governor Scanlon denies it.   Of course he does.
  And the NSA has no comment.   As a rule.
No, out. Get out.
Five minutes, please.
Thank you.
The FBI confirms that they arrested Kalabi
and that he's awaiting trial, but that's all.
That's right, that's all.
But there are agents in the FBI
who were not happy with the way this went down.
And not one of them will let us
use their name on the record.
We can't confirm the story.
Tom, we can't run a story this big without a source.
  No. I know. I know.   This paper has never done that.
  I know.   Who knows who sent you this?
I know. I know.
I need you to float something out for me.
Give it to Slugline.
What do you want me to say?
You picked it up here in the office.
It's not confirmed...
but it seems like a story.
Go ahead and print it.
And I had no idea you're doing this.
Fuck! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Well, it looks to me like
the Underwood campaign had a Muslim visiting the US
wrongly arrested in order to
influence the vote on Election Day.
And if you believe that,
then you have to ask some questions
about the impact this had on the results in Tennessee,
where President Underwood was predicted to lose.
We all know that ICO is a real threat.
Nobody is denying that, and I...
No calls get through to me, not today.
And if you get pressed,
the White House has no comment at this time.
Yes, sir.
Close the door behind you, please.
What do you know about this?
First of all, what are you getting at?
And secondly, if I had any information,
I wouldn't be keeping it to myself.
Seth, I am asking you straight up.
If you know anything, you tell me now.
  Don't make me find out.   Or what?
What are you gonna do, Doug?
You gonna suffocate me with a White House mug?
The shit is hitting the fan
and we're all going to be covered in it
if we don't get to work.
Now... can I please get back to it?
Shit.
We're essentially turning on
an apparatus that's already in place.
We'll enable audio capabilities.
All calls, e-mails, messages
in and out of the White House
will be monitored and archived.
Every phone call will be recorded as we search for the leak.
Video surveillance?
We can install additional devices,
  but...   We use what's already there.
It enables us to look and listen in on every computer
and every cell phone of everyone working for us.
We'll set up a satellite office
limited to Mr. Stamper and myself.
Assistant Director Green and I
will bring whatever is valuable forward.
I want direct access.
Live streaming.
I assure you, Mr. President,
we'll bring you anything of substance.
Do it.
And needless to say...
I report only to you, sir.
I wanna know who did this to me.
I'm on it, sir.
You're having doubts about Doug?
  Why? Are you?   No, I'm just...
I'm questioning everything, I guess.
Until this is resolved,
you and I should be very careful
about what we say or do.
And our personal needs have to be put aside.
You know people. You know them for years.
And then... suddenly they're like strangers in your kitchen.
Familiar can turn foreign on a dime.
  Is there anything I can do?   You can be quiet.
Doug, I am not the leak here. You know that.
  I'll be in touch.   Don't hang up.
Do I need to make a list of the risks
I've taken for this administration?
Things I have never done before.
Let's just talk in person, okay?
Yes?
LeAnn Harvey, please.
  Who is it?   FBI.
If you think of anything,
that's my cell at the bottom of the card.
Was it a suicide?
Barrel of the gun was pressed against his eye, so...
You were his contact. Would he do something like that?
I don't think so.
Well, maybe he didn't.
  And the gun?   That's the thing.
It's not there.
Maybe someone staying at the hotel or working there took it.
You'll let me know?
Yeah. Sure.
Mark...
the vice president and I have discussed it and...
we've come around to your position.
Very good.
Uh, considering the news that's breaking,
it's not going to be quite as easy.
Any idea where this story came from?
No, not yet. But I will soon.
I'll let it be known that you're open to censure.
And you should be aware.
It's not surprising.
Romero is moving over to the Judiciary Committee.
Well, why wouldn't he?
He wants to see this through. He's still coming after me.
Well, I imagine leadership from both parties has had enough of him.
Yeah, I don't want to diminish this.
We are in damage control.
Claire, I think...
it might be best for you to
stay out of this as much as possible.
No, I... I will defend the president.
Vice presidential business as usual
is the way to play it, I think.
You need to trust my instincts on this one.
  Okay.   Thank you, Mark.
Thank you.
You may not always agree with him, but you like him.
I like his clarity.
Let's just not forget, his candidate lost.
And now he works for you.
No, I think he's really working for you, isn't he?
Don't get paranoid, Francis.
If not now, when?
You have to go.
I what?
You need to leave.
What's happened?
There's just no place for you here anymore.
Have you been thinking about this?
Yes.
I don't agree.
I'm completely clear about it.
You can finish your coffee.
How do you do that?
Just... turn off like that?
Please go, Tom.
Go.
Okay.
If that's what you choose.
Join us?
No, I'm trying not to wear out the new model.
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?
Well, I'll get right to it, Frank.
Well, for once, the House Republicans...
are getting something done.
And the bad news is, is that thing is impeaching you.
Oh, I think the judiciary
is a long way from making any sort of decision.
They're sending articles of impeachment to the House
in the next few days, I'm told.
And that news this morning is just adding fuel to the fire.
Jesus Christ.
And I'm here to ask if you...
Would you consider resigning
instead of dragging this through the Senate?
Have the two of you lost your minds?
And you, Terry, you're under investigation yourself
and you dare come here and ask me this?
I've often hated your guts,
but I have to admit, I'll miss you.
Oh, Bob, in case you've forgotten,
the Senate is Democratic.
  I won't be leaving anytime soon.   Oh, not you.
Me. I'm getting too old for this.
What?
A House without Bob Birch? It will be unrecognizable.
I feel like it already is. God...
Was it always this dirty?
That's impossible.
Were the men before us any more moral?
Any more worthy of the power and position
that they had found themselves in?
Any more capable of doing a single goddamn thing for the public?
Well, yes and no.
History has a way of looking better than it was.
Or perhaps Shakespeare was right.
We're all just madmen leading the blind.
Ms. Lee. This is Seth Grayson, from the White House.
Yeah, thank you for taking my call.
I just had a question.
There, uh... there was a reporter.
Give me a second. Let me just check my notes.
Name's Sean Jeffries.
Yeah, he's working on a story about the donor list,
around the time of the president's transplant.
I was wondering if you could come in
and we can coordinate our response.
Ms. Lee, we don't want people to think
that the president got preferential treatment.
Jesus.
What the hell did you give me, Mac?
Jesus.
What the hell did you give me, Mac?
I had a tip on where that Slugline story came from.
You should have called me.
That wouldn't have stopped it.
  Is that why you're here?   No, I got something else.
Tell me.
I'd like to talk to the vice president about it.
That's not possible.
Everything goes through me.
Well, I didn't have a chance to explain myself.
That's too bad.
What's she like?
She doesn't suffer fools and she doesn't give second chances.
Well, if you can't get me in to talk to her again,
I'll find some other way.
You're in over your head.
Tell me what you know or move along.
No.
We don't, Mr. Hammerschmidt.
Whatever information you have...
Don't call me again.
I was concerned I was out of line the other night.
You might have been.
I'm sorry. I don't even know what I'm saying sometimes.
Forget it.
Hey, hang on a second.
I need to tell you how I'm feeling.
The nation needs you, Mr. President.
  We all need you.   We're done for today.
  No.   No?
Why don't you want to hear what I'm trying to tell you?
Listen. You... enough.
I love you. You need to know that.
  I'm only here to protect you.   You need to calm down.
What's wrong with you? Why don't you wanna hear
  what I'm telling you?   There is nothing wrong with me.
But you need to go home.
You reached out to me. You brought me in. I...
Enough.
  I'm sorry.   He's out.
I'll come back later.
Whatever it is, I can give it to him.
You can trust me to hand it over, Doug.
  You weren't directed to follow Tom Yates.   Yes, I was.
According to the president, everyone needs to be watched.
Tom's not even here anymore.
Francis asked you to follow him?
I'm concerned about someone.
Laura Moretti.
I know about her... and her husband.
Your behavior shows poor judgment, Doug,
and could be a liability for the president.
Yes, ma'am.
Give these to Francis when he gets back.
I can get you immunity.
You just need to tell the truth.
Confirm that all of Walker's testimony is true.
You don't have to do it.
No, Maureen, I want this on the record.
How dare you betray the Underwoods like this?
We're done here, Congressman.
Well, thank you for your time.
So you're prepared,
a subpoena will be coming soon from the Judiciary Committee.
Madam Secretary.
Do you wanna come in?
I'm the reason your husband's dead.
I forced the Secretary of Health and Human Services...
to put Francis Underwood in front of him on the donor list.
I understand if you think I'm a monster.
But I'd do it again.
To save the president, I'd do anything.
You really think that I didn't know, Doug?
The timing gave it away.
Come on. Come on in.
What did you think was going on here?
I'm not fucking you because I like you.
I'm fucking you because I hate you.
Get out.
Get out of my car.
Get the fuck out of my car.
Get out!
What did Macallan give you?
  I don't know what you're talking about.   I heard you.
You got something from him.
What do you mean you heard me?
Were you watching me, too?
Who was he to you?
Want a drink?
I don't drink.
Oh, right.
I was with him.
When I was young and shouldn't have been with him.
What gets you off, Doug?
Anything?
If Macallan gave you something, we should hand it over.
Did you like it?
What?
Watching me.
Yes.
You liked what you saw?
That why you came here?
Well, then.
Going to the gym. Run off some of this stress.
Where's your trainer?
Oh, he won't be coming around for a while.
He did have a facial expression I won't miss.
Is that so?
Sort of perma-smile. It was creepy.
Maybe he's just happy.
Happiness isn't my concern.
Not now, not ever.
It's a tragic situation, Claire.
  I know.   I could show you what's happening.
I've seen the images.
It's important people know what's going on in Homs.
Are you having second thoughts?
It's just the timing isn't right yet.
Because your husband doesn't have the support.
We need to make a case.
Prepare the world for when you make a statement.
I think Francis needs to be front and center on this.
You never found out what Macallan told Petrov?
My sources say he never gave him anything concrete.
  Well, he gave LeAnn something.   Well, that was our hope.
Maybe it's time to invite her back in.
Maybe. I need to get back upstairs.
The next time we meet will be in my office.
I... I don't think your husband should be front and center.
I think it should be you.
I didn't ask you what you think.
You need to be armed, Claire.
It's important that you can walk away
from anything that happens to him.
They can kiss my ass.
I got an offer from Senator Westervelt.
I'm looking, too.
But it's getting harder and harder to get off this ship.
Where is my wife?
Where has she gone?
If she was your wife, wouldn't you wonder?
Yes, Mrs. Underwood.
Don't worry. This never happened.
You don't have to tell me.
  Doug.   Shit.
Should I come in?
No. Not until you give me what you've got.
Mr. President.
"A source deep within the White House...
confirms President Underwood used questionable intelligence
to justify voting center closures,
which threw the election into chaos."
Who do you think it is?
Green, probably.
  We overestimated his loyalty.   I see.
I mean...
who else could it be?
How can I help?
We need to save ourselves here.
  It's as much your head as mine, Cathy.   I understand.
I need you to create additional documents
that justify going after Kalabi.
A paper trail that will support our actions
that we took on Election Day in Tennessee.
I'm not sure...
what those documents would be.
Well, but you're smart, Cathy, aren't you?
I mean, you can figure it out.
Why don't you just show me how smart you are.
  Of course, Mr. President.   And the presentation at the UN.
  With Syria?   It needs to happen.
  Very well.   There's a possibility of talks,
but we need to get all the interested parties back to the table.
Of course.
You're a good diplomat, Cathy.
Thank you, Mr. President.
And where is Claire?
She needed a little distance right now.
Till we find out what's happening with me.
That's why I need to rely on you, Cathy. Now.
Well, I'm glad you feel that way, Francis.
Yes. I'm ready to meet.
I wanna meet now. Right now.
After a tumultuous election,
the likes of which have never been seen,
America faces more questions...
Shit is insane right now. I don't have any more time for you.
If the recent leaks coming out of the White House
prove to be true, the president could face...
A White House ID? Where did you get that?
I thought this came from you.
What the hell are you talking about?
  I'm deputy press secretary.   The fuck you are.
I got a call from the vice president's office,
asking me to come in.
And when I got here, this was waiting for me.
I just spent the last hour doing my paperwork.
I don't have time for this.
President Garrett Walker's bombshell testimony, which...
I have Secretary Durant's resignation.
I believe she was the leak,
and might have to take responsibility
for whatever happened on election night.
Sir, the judiciary could issue a resolution
for impeachment any day now.
We need to be realistic about damage to the president
even if the Senate doesn't convict.
You promised us censure.
Well, Durant's leak took care of that, didn't it?
So, we have a plan for the Senate.
I suggest we work on protecting the vice president.
Make sure she exits this whole process unscathed.
And how do we do that?
Plead ignorance. The vice president wasn't read into anything.
Didn't know anything.
  Didn't do anything.   That won't play.
She'll look uninformed, and the people know she isn't.
Oh, the distance will help her look innocent.
Innocent, guilty, capable, incompetent, whatever it is...
the public is going to think the opposite.
So, really there is no winning.
Whatever you think is best.
You're gonna have four years to prove yourself
on the inside if I'm acquitted. Hopefully, eight.
But what happens if I'm not acquitted?
We don't have to deal with that right now.
No, I want to hear a plan.
That's why you're here.
To give me the cold, hard facts.
Oh, your calculus is as good as mine, Mr. President.
There is no plan.
Except slow down judiciary, secure the Senate.
I'm concerned about someone.
Laura Moretti.
Why did you include this?
You and Claire talking about a Laura Moretti?
I wanted you to know, sir, that she knows.
I jumped you on the list.
To receive a donor liver.
I forced the HHS Secretary to move you up.
  That's not possible.   I threatened her, sir.
It was an unprecedented ethical violation. But I don't regret it.
I kept it to myself, so that you would...
have plausible deniability if anyone found out.
I didn't tell Mrs. Underwood either.
She learned another way.
She knew and didn't tell me.
Seems so.
And how did she react to the Yates surveillance?
What did she say about that?
She didn't show her feelings to me, sir.
You saved my life.
I'm here for you, sir.
Always.
Do you have concerns about Mrs. Underwood?
  Do you?   I would never say that.
I want to show you something.
There's  minutes where I can't account for her whereabouts.
I don't know where she went or who she saw.
But she lied to me.
I, uh... I think you should get some rest, sir.
The president didn't read me in.
I wasn't in the room.
The president didn't read me in.
I wasn't in the room.
I didn't know anything about it.
The president didn't read me in.
I wasn't in the room.
I didn't know anything about it.
How's that, Francis?
This is just in. Secretary of State Catherine Durant
to appear in front of the House Judiciary Committee.
This comes as yet another surprise in the already dramatic...
  When did it come in?   A short while ago.
It's not Cathy Durant.
Are we sure?
She negotiated immunity.
And she's going on record
with everything she knows when she testifies.
Do we have any idea?
No.
Good.
Thanks.House.of.Cards.SE
I really wish I could have changed your mind, Cathy.
  I just...   Because, you know...
you know, this is just not good for you.
The negotiations with the committee
are just too far down the road.
Well, you agreed to see me because you're smart.
Because doubt is what you should be having.
Look, Cathy, I respect you.
We wouldn't have lasted as long together if I didn't.
My husband's waiting for me.
But you're gonna be made to look a fool.
There's no need to insult me, Francis.
Witness after witness is gonna rebut
whatever you have to say.
My testimony is what it is.
It'll all be resolved in the court of public opinion.
Yes, but who is the public going to believe?
You or explosive residue on a terrorist's computer?
Look, Cathy, your testimony's gonna seem petty and vengeful.
And then where is that gonna leave you? What prospects?
It's too late.
  You need to take a fall.   Excuse me?
Look, the committee is just gonna have to wait.
In two weeks, it's gonna be over anyway,
and you're gonna be on the wrong side of this thing.
  Well, we'll see.   Yes, we will.
After you.
But I meant what I said, Cathy.
Cathy?
Cathy?
Help! Help! The secretary has fallen!
You're a lucky bastard.
Oh, not until the end of the night.
Or should I say, the morning.
Catherine Durant fell? How?
Well, people fall. That's what they do.
Yes, they fall when they need to.
Your new friend is still gonna get impeached.
Well, I hope I can still count on
the good senator's support when the time comes.
You're a good card player, Mark.
You never talk shop at the table.
It's always when you're cashing out.
Well, my mother raised me well.
The numbers are getting harder and harder for the senator.
  Why is that?   The money and the calls coming in.
One number goes down, and the other one goes up.
The senator's feeling the heat, from where?
Why don't you come in later. We can talk about it then.
No, no, no. Wait a minute.
Danny... I'm counting on his vote.
  Well, you can count it out.   No. No...
And half of the Democrats as well.
Forget about censure, the House hasn't even voted yet
on articles of impeachment.
You're not the only one working the Senate.
  Someone wants Francis out.   And I'm asking you who.
You've been around a long time.
Nobody tells you how to vote.
They just tell you what happens if you don't go their way.
Oil's at   a barrel.
Nobody's happy with that.
We were hoping to bring you live coverage
of the judiciary hearing today.
But given the postponement
due to Secretary Durant's unexpected absence,
we'll be switching to
the Armed Services Committee meeting instead,
  Ma'am?   where several military officials...
...are citing the increased threat of ICO...
Today's schedule.
And I thought you might wanna see this.
It's a note from Tom Yates.
Oh, and reminder,
we have to get back to the Soldier Recovery Project.
Peace.
That's our goal.
And through peace, we must find a different way forward.
Colonel Ismat is the leader of the Democratic faction,
dedicated to freeing the Syrian people.
And since Secretary Durant is temporarily sidelined,
I'm stepping in today because the American government
supports any concrete steps toward stability.
If it is determined that chemical or biological weapons
have been used in the Syrian conflict,
then from this moment forward,
the United States will be morally obligated to intervene.
So, the Syrian president should consider himself on notice.
Mr. President, given the potential outcome
that the House will affirm articles of impeachment,
is this the right time to wade into a Middle Eastern conflict?
Well, the question's off subject, but I'll answer it.
First of all, the vote is never gonna get to the Senate.
It's a senseless partisan circus.
My focus is to remain doing my job,
which is to ensure prosperity for the American people,
and to try to achieve...
I'm sorry, how did you say it again? Peace?
  Salam.   Salam...
That's what we're trying to broker here. Salam.
So let's give the president time to meet with Colonel Ismat.
I'll take follow-up questions in the press briefing room.
Maybe I'm being too literal, but that's the sea at night.
  Do you like it?   I prefer the reds.
I... I saw a show of his at the Tate Modern.
I have trouble separating the man from the art, though.
He was, uh, depressive, as I'm sure you know.
You can see him fighting his demons.
So Mr. Nasser has arrived?
Uh, here and waiting for my call at the Four Seasons.
Well, I just... I don't think it's a good idea
for anyone in our administration
to be meeting with a member of ICO.
He's not a member.
He went to school with Yusuf Al Ahmadi.
He's a lawyer. He represents people, organizations.
  One organization, to be exact.   And he's meeting with me.
Where is all this hesitation coming from?
I'm sorry. I just have a splitting headache.
Gelsemium.
For migraines. I get them all the time.
It comes out of China.
But don't worry, it's herbal.
You have to be careful of the dosing, though.
Just two drops.
You know, it's pure feeling for me.
Light versus dark.
And that line where they meet.
The president had no idea.
You were close to Mr. Macallan?
Yes, but that doesn't mean that I knew what he was up to.
But then how do you know the president wasn't involved?
I was the last person to see Aidan. He confessed to me.
He secretly used the NSA, FISA,
to manipulate the electorate.
We're meeting with counsel
to perfect the rest of the testimony.
As long as no one has anything that contradicts you.
No one does.
Does it feel good to be back, LeAnn?
It does. Thank you.
Well, I know Claire is delighted
to have you back in her office.
Will you let me know as soon
as the vice president's meeting is done?
Yes, sir.
I hate having her back. She's a liar.
You think Macallan gave her something for insurance?
She won't admit it. But, yeah, I think he did.
Let's get her in front of that committee when they're up and running.
Then she'll have to make a choice.
Green is hesitant to testify.
You know, if I didn't know better,
I'd think he was the leak.
He has far more information
than anyone should be comfortable with.
Also, Senator Richardson hasn't called me back.
Colonel, my apologies for the interruption.
And I want to assure you that your concerns are my concerns.
The Ahmadi brothers...
their idea of radical Islam is unsustainable.
Nasser represents members of ICO who are tired of death.
They essentially control
numerous oil fields and several refineries.
Nasser already met with the president of Syria.
And Petrov's minister of foreign affairs.
He's looking for a deal.
They wanna be a corporation trading on the Dow
before the decade is over.
They wanna be a part of OPEC.
So where does that leave Colonel Ismat and the Syrian people?
Alive... once we're on the ground.
Yes, but Russia was invited in. We need cause.
The Syrian president has gassed civilians.
He will again. I can guarantee it.
Colonel Ismat will make sure of it.
He'll instigate an attack from the regime.
We put troops on the ground, leave ICO resources alone...
and Nasser will make sure they cooperate.
What is it?
Are you afraid he's gonna be impeached?
'Cause there's a good chance that he will be.
Is that why you wanna wait? 'Cause...
I can make it all wait.
Ms. Davis and I had a very productive talk.
I let her know that
our involvement is contingent on the delivery of Ahmadi.
Yes, but the window is closing for me
to be able to act on this.
Judiciary's not gonna wait.
For this to be effective, it has to be now or never.
I'll have her reach out to Mr. Nasser.
And, uh, what about the other matter?
You mean LeAnn?
Ms. Davis will speak to her later this afternoon.
You heard the president.
Uh, I'm still at the White House.
  Once we get into Syria...   Sir,
my name is Sean Jeffries.
  I work with...   Yes, I know who you are.
Sean...
I know what Tom Hammerschmidt is working on.
Mr. Jeffries, if you need an appointment, I can arrange one...
Sir, if I could. Just a moment of your time.
It's confidential.
Oh, if you don't mind, we'd like this room for a moment.
You have  seconds. But before you start,
am I mistaken, or is Mr. Grayson your superior?
Yes, I'm sorry, but...
Tom thinks Doug Stamper and yourself, sir,
are somehow involved with the death of Zoe Barnes.
And Mr. Hammerschmidt has a phone
that was given to Ms. Barnes.
It called only one number, and that number was yours.
Now, it seems that number
has shown up on the phone that she died with.
It was damaged, but there's technology now
that will give them access to the data
leading up to the day of her death.
Its internal memory. Calls, texts.
It's all there.
When did you start with us?
A week ago.
And it was the vice president who brought you on?
That's correct.
A week...
and you're already having
confidential conversations with the president.
I am.
If you hear anything else, you come directly to me.
Yes, sir.
Whatever you say it is, it's perjury.
Oh, perjury, huh?
That's where you draw the line?
I'm done.
The case has already been prepared.
TATP was found on Muhammed Kalabi's computer.
It doesn't matter what Secretary Durant believes or not.
One is speculation, and the other is fact.
Fact? Really? Is that what it is?
If it sounds like a fact, then it is a fact.
Kalabi had explosive residue on his keyboard.
You know the rest of the bureau is done with the president.
I'm not talking to them. I'm talking to you.
They've looked the other way, but for how much longer?
Doug... he's done.
Where does that leave me?
That's what we're discussing right now.
Do you know what the president thinks?
He thinks you're the leak.
I wish.
I'm going to give you a moment to take that statement back.
I'll do what I have to do. I'll testify.
But the president is done.
He's losing support. You can smell it.
Are you working for anyone else?
  Are you working for anyone else?   No.
And I don't wanna know anything else.
I'm tired of what I know.
Consider me a proxy.
  What?   They don't wanna ask, but I will.
You need to be fully committed,
which means being fully transparent,
which means handing over what you have.
Slow down, will you, please?
I'd like to get home, Ms. Davis.
LeAnn? LeAnn?
Some nights, I go to a hotel to sleep,
just to get out of my apartment.
Being a woman in this city, the vigilance it takes...
You're not allowed to make a mistake... get distracted.
It's a heavy price.
To be on the edge that way for years and years...
My testimony won't disappoint.
Well, the president and vice president are pleased, I assume.
But how long before the media
starts asking questions about Macallan's death,
and how he was killed?
I have your gun, by the way.
  Good night.   Yes, good night.
Claire?
  Yes?   Claire?
What's the matter?
Hammerschmidt has a new theory.
He thinks Doug Stamper and I killed Zoe Barnes.
They may have access to my cell phone, to my texts.
Someone in this White House is talking to Hammerschmidt
and now this.
Oh, Doug.
Poor Doug.
Yes.
He's an unlucky person.
Always has been.
Sir, the senator's support is wavering.
Doug, it's Claire.
I'm sorry, I...
Francis and I were wondering
if you could come up to the residence tomorrow evening.
For dinner.
It'll give us a chance to
take a breath with all that's been happening.
Hello?
Happy birthday.
  Who is this?   Come on, you must know by now.
  No, I don't.   Aidan Macallan.
Look into how he used and abused the FISA ruling.
How do we know each other?
Now come on.
If I told you that,
how can I possibly keep helping you?
And don't you want me to help you?
But where do we meet? Just give me that.
  In the muck.   Wait.
Zoe Barnes' death was not an accident.
Doug Stamper killed her.
But you already know that.
No, don't hang up. Don't hang up.
The Judiciary Committee may be
hoping Secretary Durant recovers.
But the rest of the world is waiting to see
how the Syrian president responds
to President Underwood's line in the sand.
Moscow, meanwhile, calls the president's statements,
"The desperate act of a man on his way out of office."
Are you in contact with your brother?
No.
Sundays. Occasional birthday.
I thought you were closer than that.
No. We usually only speak when one of us is in trouble.
Well, that's why I ask,
'cause in times like these, we all need support.
Well, I'll have counsel.
No, you'll have the best lawyers.
The best of everything. The best.
Would you like some more fish?
No, thank you.
Whatever the Herald has is circumstantial.
Of course.
No one knows what really happened to her,
and no one ever will.
But, look, Doug...
The reason that Claire and I invited you over tonight
is because we want you to know how much you mean to us.
To both of us.
Yes, sir.
Before we say anything else,
we just wanted to be absolutely certain that...
you knew that.
Of course.
What we're up against,
what this administration is facing...
Well, what I'm facing...
Even though both of us believe that
there's very little chance that I could ever be indicted,
we still...
have to find a way to
remove this entire issue from the table.
I just can no longer be associated with this.
I'll resign while I'm dealing with this.
I think this is going to require more than that.
Well, I'll make a statement...
and blame it on the politics of personal destruction.
No, Doug, I'm afraid that's just not going to be enough.
We have to shift... the suspicion.
We need you to...
We need you to implicate yourself in the death of Zoe Barnes.
Now, before you react, just listen.
You are the most likely candidate at this point.
You were distraught, you were drinking.
The... I don't know.
We'll make up some story, and then we'll leak it.
You... you were loyal, you did it for me.
You were too loyal. You went too far.
And... and then, in the end, there'll be no question...
Can you excuse me?
Well, it's either a crank looking for a headline,
or someone on the inside telling the truth.
What's your sense?
He knew about the birthday cards.
I don't know.
Maybe the story is the call.
The flash drives. The leaks themselves.
If we call out the leaks,
he may stop contacting me.
And the Macallan business, is that even a real lead?
None of these sites will admit to anything.
Because it's an embarrassment.
An overwhelming amount of Underwood material
was reported by social media users in counties
that he was expected to lose.
But anyone I reach out to
does not wanna be talking about this.
The leak said it was unauthorized domestic surveillance.
All the administration has to say is "terror,"
And they seem justified.
He wasn't rooting out terrorists.
He was trying to win an election.
And very convenient that the Secretary of State hits her head.
Now you sound like a conspiracy...
I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
I try to imagine what it's like inside his mind,
what I would do if I were him.
And I'm telling you, it is all sorts of...
He has no ideology. No North Star.
Isn't that the scariest thing of all?
Tom, do you think Zoe Barnes was murdered?
How often does a  year-old fall in front of a train?
  All right, then. Let's prove that.   All right.
What's wrong?
Doug Stamper's office called.
They wanna set up a meeting.
Soon as possible.
This is good.
Whatever your boyfriend read off your phone this morning
made its way to the right person.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
You're lying to a liar.
You can't get anything off the phone Zoe died with.
They just need to believe we can.
What is this job?
Not what it used to be.
I don't want you to overreact.
But Tom kept writing.
It seems he finally finished his book.
And he alludes to things.
What do you mean "Alludes to things"?
I don't know. Lines are blacked out.
It's like it's redacted.
There are paragraphs here and there...
What did you tell him?
What does he know?
Has he shown this to anyone? Sent it to anyone?
  Publishers, the press?   I don't know.
Well, what do you know?
I will handle him. I just wanted you to be aware.
  Son of a bitch.   I said I'll take care of it.
No, I'll take care of it.
You stay a million miles away from this.
How could you be so stupid...
to fall in love?
This thing isn't on the floor yet,
and we're losing senators.
We're losing some maybe, but...
What I like about the Senate is what I hate.
It's contagious.
One of 'em gets an idea,
and it spreads through the body like a flu.
I'll look into it.
There's  of 'em. All we need is half.
Can I just lay down?
  I don't think that's a good idea.   Just for a few minutes.
I'm just so fucking tired, and I need to think.
Why do you need to think?
The longer you hang on to whatever he gave you,
the more danger you're in.
You're reading this wrong.
You think it's some kind of insurance, but it's not.
LeAnn...
Whatever happens to the president,
it's not your fault, or mine.
  You don't think I make a difference?   I didn't say that.
You don't think that I'm dedicated enough?
Too dedicated.
That can be a problem. That can make you blind.
You have no idea...
I've done something unforgivable, LeAnn.
What?
I killed Zoe Barnes.
Why would you say that?
All I ever tried to do was keep her safe.
She said she wanted to be invisible.
I knew it wasn't possible.
I knew that she would only ever go away...
if I made sure of it.
I don't believe you.
Yes, you do.
Believe me... I deserve this.
Zoe Barnes fell in front of a train.
It was ruled an accident.
I pushed her off the platform and I walked away.
I know you reached out to Bridget Cohen.
Telling that committee or her how I got my liver
is not going to help this administration or you.
But here is what is going to help.
This is what you're going to tell that committee
about Doug Stamper.
You actually live here?
Well... I'm not here that much.
I let friends use it now and again.
  Thanks for your discretion.   Of course.
I won't be too long.
Take your time.
If you need anything, I'll be on call.
He's reasonable.
Yeah, he needs to be.
They didn't look that hard.
The Secret Service knows I have nothing to hide.
He's downstairs.
Make yourself at home.
I used to love to hide as a kid.
I was really good at it.
I could always choose the best places.
Nobody ever found me.
One time, everybody just gave up.
So I stayed put for, like,  hours straight.
What do you want?
He said I wouldn't regret it... if I said yes.
Francis.
When I agreed to write the book
about his origin story way back when.
Well, he regrets asking you now.
I said yes 'cause I have always been a sucker
for what people tell themselves about themselves.
Who has the manuscript?
You do.
And publishers?
Not yet.
So what did you think?
There are huge sections blacked out, Tom.
You portrayed us like a couple of monsters.
  I never used that word.   You didn't have to.
On the flight back from Moscow, not long after we met...
you and Francis had a fight.
A real knock down.
I told Francis I heard the yelling,
but not the words.
But...
you said you were murderers.
He said you were survivors.
I was dreading coming here.
  Why?   You can't publish it, Tom.
I'd rather not.
So, what? Money?
Yeah... but enough.
Enough so I can really get lost for a while.
Buy some time till I figure out what I'm gonna do next.
We can figure something out.
I bet.
You know, those parts you blacked out, that's...
  I've never told anyone but you.   I know.
I know everything.
But isn't that what you wanted?
I miss touching you.
I don't know how to not be around you.
I think of you all the time.
It almost makes me hate you for it.
I don't know what to do.
You're so beautiful.
  Keep going.   Not just beautiful, beautiful.
There's lots of people like that.
You are radiant, Claire.
And good. You are so good.
  I'm not good.   Yes, you are.
  Why won't you kiss me?   I wanna look at you.
I really do wanna go to Greenland one day.
  We should go.   Don't stop.
It's so frozen and remote.
The way the...
The way the... Smells before it...
The... You know what I mean?
Help. Help.
Tom?
There are close to half a million dead.
Over four million refugees,
women and children who have left the region and require care.
At least  million displaced people.
Homeless wanderers who no longer belong anywhere.
We are all students of history.
Syria was one of the founding members of the United Nations,
for God's sakes.
How did we get here?
We, who sprang from one of the most ancient civilizations?
At some point, we must accept peace as the only answer.
All parties must lay down their arms and begin to talk.
Okay.
You were always good at tracking me down.
It wasn't easy.
Movie theater, the occasional classified meeting.
I know what you're doing.
Well, that's a bit vague.
You're sabotaging him. Peeling off senators.
I know it's you.
You were much more interesting when you smoked.
No, I wasn't.
The money's not with him, Mark.
The... the Koch brother types, Wall Street, oil and gas...
Even labor's walking out on him.
He's more resourceful than you think.
He's done a lot without money, okay?
I want you to back off,
let me handle these hearings.
I just got to the White House.
I intend to stick around.
I don't want him to be president.
  The country needs a change.   Okay, so...
And they don't need to look any further than his wife.
She's tough, smart.
He's smart, too, but he's not reliable.
Her? You can work with her.
I know you see it, too.
I see a partner when it comes to Syria,
or what's left of it.
Let me try one of those.
I mean, far be it from us
to tell an ancient civilization its business...
but Syria is now basically unrivaled
as the most violent place on the planet.
I know, I know.
I'm not saying what to do with Frank Underwood
is not gonna be a difficult problem.
But... if we don't establish a presence in the region...
it's gonna be too late.
  I'd rather have a cigarette.   Spit it out.
Well... let me buy you dinner or something.
What? What happened? What's the matter?
I had that child in my arms.
I could feel her breath on me,
but I couldn't look down.
Excuse me.
Yeah?
  Okay. I have to go. I'm sorry.   Do, please.
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.
I need your services.
Jesus.
No.
Now.
I believe Doug Stamper killed Zoe Barnes.
I believe he was unstable
and killed her to benefit Francis Underwood.
Stop. Stop it, please? Off the record.
Can you give us a second? I'll call you back in.
Seth, this has nothing to do with pay for play, or Kalabi,
or anything else the president is accused of.
Where are you getting this?
This is what I know about Doug.
The chair will not let you
testify in front of the committee with this.
  This is what I have.   Can you prove any of it?
He's implied that he did it.
I can speak to his behavior.
Things that he's done.
You need to go to the US attorney.
Seth, if you don't, I will.
"I told the president there were four men by the same name
the State Department was tracking.
Two in the United States."
So said a senior White House source,
as quoted in the Washington Herald.
Were you aware of this conversation?
No, sir, I was not.
The source went on.
"I believe the president understood
that the Muhammed Kalabi in Tennessee
was not a legitimate threat."
Was this conveyed to you in any way?
Again, no, sir.
Still, the committee's looking forward to
Secretary Durant's testimony on this matter.
I have no idea what the secretary will say or not say, but I...
have great respect for her and wish her a speedy recovery.
We were operating off of facts and
reports coming in at an accelerated rate that day.
I'll try this again.
Did the president indicate to you at any time
that he knew this was not a threat?
No.
And I'd like to point out that I'm proud
to be representing the men and women of the FBI here today,
who conducted that investigation as they always do
in a competent, honest, and independent way,
in the finest tradition of the FBI.
  Did they?   Our people did their job.
And it's unthinkable to assume
the FBI would involve itself in an election.
Because there may be an innocent man
sitting in a cell as we speak.
I can comment on this since it was mentioned in the press.
Trace amounts of an explosive material
were found on Mr. Kalabi's computer.
Your assertion is that the president was unaware
of what was happening in his own White House?
Aidan Macallan was an NSA employee,
so, no, the president had no idea what he was up to.
Honestly, he was quite busy campaigning.
But surely he knew the effects of Mr. Macallan's work?
These exploits?
No.
The president and... I've been with him out on the stump.
He likes to shake hands.
He's not paying attention to social media.
Ms. Harvey, there was a FISA ruling issued,
which the Underwood administration used
to spy on American citizens
for the sake of swaying an election.
Congressman Romero, Aidan Macallan was a troubled person.
His mind worked fast,
faster than I think anyone's should.
What he was up to went to the grave with him.
Ms. Harvey, please, spare me the semantics...
  Okay, fine.   I just need you...
Was he collecting data? Yes.
Did he cross a line? Most likely.
I did visit with him, checking in on his work.
Have you seen a screen of code? Computer code.
It's indecipherable.
Why did Seth Grayson end up not testifying?
No comment.
We heard that his testimony
had to do with the president's chief of staff.
Who I would welcome testifying in front of our committee.
I urge Doug Stamper and the rest of the administration
to stop hiding behind executive privilege.
All we learned so far is that
the president knew nothing about anything going on in his White House.
There were six of them,
and they all took a turn.
Except for Romero.
He only watched.
Or... at least that's what he told the dean.
But I know the real story.
Her name was, uh, Rochelle.
I thought you had nothing on this guy.
How long have you known this?
I was holding it until... Or, if we needed it.
No, until you needed it, you mean.
Look, it makes no difference.
I might use it, I might not.
But I still wanna testify.
For you to testify now,
excuse me for saying it, it's crazy.
Do you think it's crazy, Claire?
  I wanna defend myself against this guy.   We have witnesses.
Our witnesses, surrogates. Let it come from them.
I think I can win.
Or maybe I should wait until I lose the Senate...
I just think there are other ways...
If you give up executive privilege,
we lose leverage. We lose it all.
Tell the chair I'm ready to appear.
I mean, the damage your testimony could do to your wife
is not worth the risk.
Its worth is what we're here to discuss.
I... I don't appreciate being the one to tell you this, but...
your presidency is beyond repair.
You don't know what I'm going to do next.
Isn't that it? Isn't that what really bothers you?
Don't think I haven't been watching you
from the moment you stepped on board.
You're full of promises, Ms. Davis.
The information about Macallan is still out there
and Ahmadi is, oh, so elusive.
You've been sabotaging me
from the moment you stepped into my house.
You don't care for me very much, do you?
No, I don't.
I couldn't care less.
But if you make Claire happy, that makes me happy.
  If you can help her, good.   What's it worth to you?
Well, what kind of deal are we talking about?
For me not to testify.
Well, I have contacts outside the Beltway.
I can set you up in any number of lucrative positions.
No, that's not good enough.
Anyone could offer me that.
You tell me.
No, no, no. It's not going to work like that.
You tell me what you can do for me.
I've been around your kind.
Not usually at this level.
But you can't help yourself.
Make me an offer, Ms. Davis.
What is she worth to you?
A lot.
So then here's what I'm thinking.
Do you solemnly swear and affirm
that the testimony you are about to give is the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Let the record reflect that
the witness has answered in the affirmative.
Mr. President, I want to thank you for appearing...
and I hope we get to clear some things up
for the American people.
Mr. President, the floor is yours.
You can take as long or as short as you like.
If you have any written statement,
we will include it after and it will be part of the record.
Mr. President, you are recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman...
and to the other members of this committee.
I have agreed to appear before this committee today...
because...
I'm guilty.
Guilty of having spent the last  years of my life here...
in this Congress.
In this House.
Then as vice president and now as president,
trying to do the people's work.
Now, this committee has accused me of a great number of things.
You accused me of pay to play.
And so I accuse you of exactly the same.
I also accuse you of playing politics only when it suits you.
You're all being paid.
You're all serving some master.
Each and every one of you,
and you know I know that for a fact.
You, for example, Congressman Romero...
and your crusade to take me down, is it for justice?
For the good of the nation?
Is the truth what you're really after?
Or is it for some personal gain?
Perhaps to try to fill
the small hole in your soul
that you sold off a long time ago?
  Mr. President.   No, no, no.
This is my opening statement,
and I will give it in full.
I am not done, ladies and gentlemen.
You accuse me of breaking the rules,
and I tell you, I am playing by the rules.
The very rules that you and I all agreed upon.
The very rules that you and I all wrote together.
So, yes, I'm guilty as hell,
but then so are all of you.
Yes, the system is corrupt,
but you wanted a guardian at the gate like me.
And why?
Because you know I will do whatever it takes.
And you have all enjoyed it,
been party to it and benefited by it.
Don't deny it. You've loved it.
You don't actually need me to stand for anything.
You just need me to stand.
To be the strong man.
The man of action.
My God, you're addicted to action and slogans.
It doesn't matter what I say.
It doesn't matter what I do.
Just as long as I'm doing something,
you're happy to be along for the ride.
And frankly, I don't blame you.
With all the foolishness and indecision in your lives,
why not a man like me?
I don't apologize.
In the end, I don't care whether you love me or you hate me,
just as long as I win.
The deck is stacked. The rules are rigged.
Welcome to the death of the Age of Reason.
There is no right or wrong. Not anymore.
There's only being in...
and then being out.
So I will not be party to this any longer.
I will not wear the target for any of you anymore.
You have all used me far long enough.
So, the party's over, the ride's done.
I respect the office too much
to allow this to continue going on.
That's why I am announcing to this committee and to the nation
p.m. tomorrow evening,
I shall resign the office of President of the United States.
Order!
And I will be happy to take any questions you may have.
But my gut tells me that isn't really going to be necessary.House.of.Cards.SE
Oh, Congressman Romero,
I just wanted to see you one last time before I leave.
I don't believe there's anything left to be said.
No, not between us. Not any longer.
I just wanted to thank you for...
your tenacity.
Whatever you're up to, you won't get away with it.
Maybe I already have.
The committee will continue its work.
We'll recommend charges to DOJ.
Rochelle.
Rochelle.
Such a lovely name.
Tell me how much you don't want that to end up in the press.
And then shut this committee down.
No deals.
Mr. President! Mr. President!
How could you?
  How could you not warn me?   To protect you.
  I was protecting you.   You should take your hands off me.
No, look, I understand if you feel broadsided.
  I don't care about feelings, Francis.   But listen to me...
Look, Claire, listen to me.
You made me look absolutely ridiculous.
  Ill-prepared and ignorant.   No! Claire.
  We have one rule, Francis.   No,
  One rule.   not anymore.
Not anymore. We don't.
I cannot be your ally if I don't know what you're thinking.
Listen, Claire. It would have never ended.
All right, fine, we got to stop judiciary,
but other committees would have sprung up,
just to keep the charges going.
Oversight, Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence.
It would have gone on and on.
  Years and years of investigation.   I don't care, Francis.
You should have talked to me,
instead of making a last-minute decision like this.
I didn't.
I created this confusion in order to take advantage of it.
Everything that has happened... was planned.
Since when?
Since before Elysian Fields.
But it was at Elysian Fields that it hit me.
I saw it...
almost like a light bulb going off above my head.
Where does the real power lie?
The power behind the power.
And I understood, Claire,
that we have to think and act differently than we ever have.
Because it's no longer about who lives in the White House...
it's about who owns the White House.
This is the presidency. How much higher can a politician go?
The real power isn't here.
It's beyond here.
It's above it, but still working in conjunction with it.
Look, Claire, you and I have always been on the inside.
Trapped. In the bubble.
But going forward...
with my operating on the outside, in the private sector,
and you working from here...
we can own this house together.
Don't you see? I've designed this.
I wanted you to be the president.
I've made you the president.
Am I supposed to say thank you?
No.
But you will have to pardon me. Pardon me for all of my crimes.
As the president, you're the only one who can.
Francis, I could be impeached if I do that.
No, no. Look, Davis and Usher,
they're in a position to protect you.
  They want you to succeed.   We can be sure of nothing, Francis.
Everything going on with Doug,
the leak still in the White House...
No, that was me, too.
  What?   I'm the leak.
I've been feeding information to Tom Hammerschmidt
for months with Doug's help.
That doesn't make any sense, Francis.
Claire, when you bring yourself down before someone else can,
you control the way it happens.
This was the only path to get us to this moment
where you and I can own it all.
Get rid of the surveillance.
Erase it. Shut everything down. Anything you and Doug were up to.
All right. But you have to pardon me first.
And, at the right time, Doug.
Or we could both go to prison.
I killed Tom.
I killed Tom Yates. He's dead.
And I had Mark clean it up.
So it will never make its way back to us.
Well, then I guess we both did what we had to.
  Did you know he was gonna do this?   No.
Because this is bad, Claire. This is very... very bad.
My God!
What is it with you two?
  If there's something on your mind, say...   In my house?
You left him in my house?!
Lower your voice, or at least change your tone.
Did you take care of it?
Yes, that's what I do.
Then thank you, and well done.
Now let's get back to what's in front of us.
Does he even want you to be here, Claire?
Mark, please. What I need right now is your political calculus.
He has put you, he has put all of us, in an impossible position.
You see that?
If you don't handle this correctly, you do not recover from it.
This is about continuity of government.
Informing NATO, informing world leaders.
We should have had ambassadors on call.
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security...
Even Nixon did that!
I'm ready to hand it over,
but I want to be assured that no matter what,
Macallan's death is not related to me.
That can be taken care of.
  I want what you have of mine.   Okay.
That's what you'll get.
And I want to be Chief of Staff.
Well, I don't think that's a problem.
I'm glad you're asking for what you want.
Doug Stamper would do anything for the president.
He saw a threat in Zoe Barnes,
who the president was involved with.
And he took care of it.
He's threatened my life on numerous occasions.
  But to go back to my question...   No, ma'am.
I don't think the president knew what Doug was up to.
Not at all.
Mr. Hammerschmidt.
I've been meaning to call you.
Sean.
As you can tell, I work here now.
I'm shaking your hand right now
because I believe in social graces.
You're lost.
  I don't think so.   No, you are.
No, not at all.
This is what you wanted?
A job in a corrupt administration? Presidency in ruin?
I'm in the White House.
Not out there, wondering what it's like in here.
Not for long.
Once you're in, you're in. It's the American way.
  Mr. Stamper will see you now.   Thank you.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
When I asked for this meeting, I had no idea
the president would be signing his resignation this evening.
And I, this morning.
  I heard a rumor you might.   Now it's confirmed.
Mr. Stamper...
Yeah, please. You can call me Doug.
I'd rather not, for the sake of this interview.
I want you to know this will not be off the record,
or on background.
I do know Lisa Williams. I met her a couple years ago.
Okay.
But before we get to anything else...
did President Underwood,
when he was congressman, kill Zoe Barnes?
No.
Mr. Stamper...
did you kill Zoe Barnes?
I'm not prepared to answer that question.
You understand I can use your refusal in print.
Yes.
Were you on the Cathedral Heights D.C. Metro platform
the day of Zoe's death?
Any questions regarding Zoe Barnes,
you need to speak with my attorneys.
Did Zoe Barnes make a call to Francis Underwood
from a burner phone when he was congressman?
  Why would you ask me that?   Why won't you answer?
I almost always answer the president's phone.
Calls, texts...
Do you have any knowledge of those texts?
I'm not prepared to comment on that.
Then this conversation is over.
Have a good day.
One last thing.
Did you send me two birthday cards?
No.
Slinte mhath.
That's Scottish Gaelic. It means "Good health."
My father's kind of obsessed.
And he traced our line of Graysons back to,
like, th century or something.
Well, if we ever needed a drink in the middle of the day...
It went well with the US attorney.
It's tragic.
Our hearts are just broken at the thought of what Doug did.
I don't know what happened to him.
I guess somewhere along the line...
When will, uh, he be announcing his resignation?
  It's happening this afternoon.   Oh, of course.
And, Seth, you'll need to resign as well.
  I thought that, uh...   I know, but think about this.
I need to establish my own team. Publicly.
And there's no avoiding
how tied you and Doug are to Francis at this point.
So, it's really just waiting for the dust to settle. That's all.
Why does it feel like you're telling me
my career is over, Madam Vice President?
No, I'm just saying, you just need to go away for a little while.
And we'll bring you back into the fold at a later date,
and don't worry.
Look at LeAnn. She left and now she's back.
Have we ever had a drink together?
Never.
I wanted to hand this to you while you were still president.
I accept this with a heavy heart.
I had a strategy session with the attorneys yesterday.
I hope they're treating you well.
You know...
Doug, we're not gonna be able
to see each other for some time now.
So why don't you take something?
  No.   No, no. Go on. Take something.
Anything. Anything you want. Even if it's small.
Something you can hold in your hand
to remind you of this place... until you get back.
You go on.
We're a few hours away from my official resignation...
and you still have not agreed to pardon me.
And if you don't,
I will be forced to renege on that resignation.
That would be outrageous.
Well, it isn't official until I submit a signed letter.
And what would that do to the rest of your presidency?
What would be left of it?
Claire, if you don't do it,
you're gonna risk being married to a felon.
And if I do, where does that leave me?
Look, is this really the conversation you want to be having?
You've trapped me, Francis.
No, I do not accept that I've done something to you.
I have provided you with an opportunity.
Now, you have said before, that this is your endgame.
And now, your goal is within spitting distance
and all you see is betrayal? I don't buy it.
Stop talking about what I've done to you.
Admit it.
This is what you want.
You were willing to kill for it.
So, Claire, come and take it...
before I take it back.
We'll find the most strategic time and place.
But I will pardon you, Francis.
For the good of the nation, we need to disband this committee,
and put this behind us.
The president most likely would not have survived the hearings.
You could argue that he had no choice but to resign.
But we can't deny that his testimony struck a chord.
Well, that may be true.
But how is it that you, Congressman Romero,
his biggest critic, are supporting him now?
History.
By the end of the day,
the country will have its first woman president.
Look, I've always been a supporter of the idea
of a woman in the Oval Office.
But when all is said and done,
you do realize that Francis Underwood
will still be sleeping in the White House tonight?
Isn't this when you pack everything up?
Or at least take the personal things?
I'm not taking anything.
You can do what you want with it.
  When do you meet with the US attorney?   Day after tomorrow.
I never thought that Frank Underwood would not be president.
Not really.
You could just run away.
What does that get me?
You're good at taking care of yourself.
That's funny.
Look, I want you to know that I care for you,
but I don't know how much I can be there.
I think I'm gonna just sit here for a while.
Yeah, you should.
Uh, the vice president would like you to leave the White House
before she's sworn in.
She doesn't think it would be a good idea for word to get out
that you were here when it happened.
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute
the office of President of the United States,
and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect
and defend the Constitution of the United States.
  So help me God.   Here we are again.
You know, if you ignore all the pomp and circumstance,
the most perverse thing is I actually believe in the presidency.
Its importance.
What it means around the world, even symbolically.
But I believe in power even more. For its own sake.
Gore Vidal once wrote that power is an end to itself,
and the instinctive urge to prevail...
the most important single human trait.
I've always told myself that everything I did was for her.
But maybe it wasn't. Maybe I love power more.
For you, and for any dear to you,
I would do anything.
If my career were of that better kind
that there was any opportunity or capacity to sacrifice in it,
I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.
Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times,
as ardent and sincere in this one thing.
The time will come,
the time will not be long in coming,
when new ties will be formed about you.
The ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly
to the home you so adorn.
The dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you.
Oh, Miss Manette,
when the little picture
of a happy father's face looks up in yours...
Good evening.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Sean Jeffries.
I'm the new deputy director of communications.
Where's Seth?
Mr. Grayson got called away last minute,
so I'm temporarily filling his shoes.
Uh, I...
I won't be taking any questions.
Instead, I'll be reading from a prepared statement.
A few hours ago,
President Underwood resigned
the office of President of the United States.
And in a private ceremony attended by staff,
President Claire Underwood was sworn in.
Effective immediately, she will be assuming the office
of President of the United States.
  Details will be coming shortly...   You must be so proud of him.
And while President Francis Underwood couldn't be here today...
Transfer of power happened three hours ago,
quote, "privately and quietly."
And that's above the fold.
  Anything from DOJ?   Nothing yet.
No official title to him,
but it's Mark Usher running the transition.
Okay. Let's find out who's in and who's out.
The dominoes are falling.
  Now, who's on Romero?   Here.
  We want the congressman on the record.   I've got it.
And let's save Macallan for the weekend.
Tom, where are we with Doug Stamper?
There's, uh, something I need to check on.
Slugline, BuzzFeed,
half the outlets in this city are ready to jump on this.
You spoke to him. One on one.
  He didn't actually say he did it.   He doesn't have to.
Does anyone know what Seth Grayson said to the US attorney?
Tom?
Two years you've been writing about this administration.
  This is it.   I want to follow up, that's all.
I see a beautiful city
and a brilliant people rising from this abyss.
And in their struggles to be truly free,
in their triumphs and defeats,
through long years to come,
I see the evil of this time and of the previous time
of which this is the natural birth,
gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.
Surface-to-surface missiles delivered sarin
at about three o'clock in the morning, our time.
Moscow has already issued a statement condemning the rebels
for orchestrating the attack on themselves.
  And did they?   Of course not.
Petrov will use this to justify air strikes.
I'd like to show you an image.
This one is coming out of Reuters.
The feeling is most of the press will be using it by the a.m.
Experience tells me
this will resonate for about three to five days...
which gives us our window.
Well, we can ready a statement.
Troops on the ground is the statement.
No, I don't want to do anything until we find Ahmadi's location.
I'm not sure we should wait on this, Madam President.
I'd like to remind you that it was this administration
that introduced the ultimatum.
You should act on it.
Yes, but I barely have a team in place.
Well, you can run it by the former president...
The former president is just that.
An opportunity has presented itself.
And I'm trying to take advantage of it.
  Is everyone in the Situation Room?   As of  minutes ago.
So, the timing is bad.
If you pardon him now, you're associated with his crimes.
Republicans will have a field day.
We need some cover.
Well, that would be Ahmadi's capture.
The right VP would help all this.
Have you had any further thoughts?
My short list is the same.
Westervelt, Clark, Klein.
Klein would be the strongest bulwark
against calls for your impeachment.
  Swallowing poison to stay alive.   Alive is good.
I don't think I can stomach Klein.
He called me a bitch. I prefer Clark.
Tell me. Before you moved the body,
were you able to close his eyes?
Yes.
Look... I know his opinion means a lot to you.
Francis.
But having him here, in the White House, even in the East Wing,
while we're trying to figure this out, it's hard.
At some point, someone is going to imply
that he is still making the decisions.
That wouldn't be good.
  I'll advise her. She'll come around.   I hope so.
Because if she doesn't act now, when it comes to Syria,
her presidency could be in danger.
And your future in doubt.
Oh, don't threaten me, Ms. Davis.
I don't threaten.
I just try to remain as clear as possible.
You offered me your services, and I offered you mine.
You know...
I was here before you and I'll be here after you.
And regardless of that, let me remind you...
that nothing is more dangerous than me.
You need to be practical now. Davis isn't wrong.
We've been trying to get our hands on Ahmadi for a year, Francis.
  She hasn't delivered.   Yes, but this isn't about her.
This is about you and coming out with a strong message
in your first address to the nation.
This is about setting the course for your presidency.
Be strong, Claire.
Go to war.
But I need you to leave.
Leave the White House.
Yes, I see.
For this pardon to succeed, Francis,
we need to appear to be estranged.
I'm just being strategic.
And where do you suggest I go?
I'm not sure.
The Naval Observatory?
I think the vice president's residence is still too close.
I'm sorry, I just...
We can't have anyone think you're still involved in policy.
Look, if you're having second thoughts,
  you should tell me now.   No. I'm in full agreement.
'Cause this is no time to hesitate.
I am not hesitating.
I just believe if we don't play this correctly,
as far as the public,
my term will be nothing but survival for both of us.
All right.
I want you to know I'm here
if you need any advice on policy or anything else you might need.
Thank you. I'm going to bed.
No one will ever love you as much as I do.
I hope you know that.
Just as I know that no one will ever love me... like you.
"Under the porcelain frog."
The answers are case-sensitive and exact.
You won't get a second chance.
  And the middle one?   My favorite baseball player?
"Wade Boggs." Two G's.
And the last?
"What did you leave in that hotel room in Austin?"
Where is my gun?
Here you go.
What guarantees do I have?
I gave you your gun back.
But what made you give it to him? I'm curious.
I thought he was in danger.
And now you think what?
That is what I'm asking.
As long as I'm around, you'll be a part of this administration.
We both know too much about Aidan.
And Claire knows how loyal you are. I'm sure of it.
So, what did you leave in that hotel room in Austin?
A bracelet.
That's too bad.
You know, I finally got a look
at what Macallan passed on to Ms. Harvey.
I was shocked to realize the degree
to which you and your husband stole this election.
I need to be honest with you.
I've been in talks with him about
helping him start a foundation of some kind.
In exchange for influence over you.
Interesting.
I'm trying to help you navigate this transition.
Who are you to me?
Who do you want me to be?
That's not a good answer.
You're the first woman President of the United States.
All you've had to swallow, the sacrifices, the compromises.
You're gonna want to isolate yourself.
Not trust anyone.
But that's exactly what you're gonna need.
Someone to tell you what's what.
And is that person you?
Is it?
I don't think there's anything
I could say that would convince you
if you don't already feel it.
Ms. Davis, you are asking me to start a war.
And you seem to deliver on promises when it suits you.
So forgive me if I question your intentions.
I like you.
I like being around you.
And sometimes that makes me less effective than I should be.
Pardoning or not pardoning your husband,
in either case, he's a liability.
If it's not treated properly...
your husband's liver could fail him at any time.
It's not the kind of thing I could do.
But I could find someone, or...
I... I don't know if you realize,
but... even something like gelsemium
can be lethal in higher doses.
My husband's health is just fine.
I'll continue to work with him. Follow your lead.
Here's my client's passport.
There's a few things we want to go over.
That we haven't already?
No cuffs, when you walk him out of here. I need to be sure.
Oh, come on, James, we aren't gonna play that on this.
You have some very good friends, Mr. Stamper,
to keep the press out of this.
You will walk out of here like a gentleman.
We want him in front of the judge within  hours.
We don't even know if we're gonna charge him yet.
I did it.
Let's get going.
Who do you have on her cabinet?
Right now, they're just suggestions.
Oh, come on. We both know how this works.
You've already made your choices.
You wouldn't be worth your salt if you hadn't.
I just want you to run them by me first.
Look, I can make this transition easy for you or not.
And a word of advice.
She's gonna need some
friendly faces looking at her across that table.
There'll be a few...
who will smile as required.
Would you look at this?
Both Special Forces. Former.
They know how to forget, so you don't have to worry about them.
And the body?
It's on ice.
I just made contact with Nasser.
We have secured the location of Ahmadi.
I'll assemble the team.
I called Admiral Dale already.
So we have some decisions to make.
Once we have troops on the ground,
we'll need to take a close look
at who we're considering for your cabinet.
You'll need a team around you with wartime experience.
I have some suggestions I've passed on to Mark.
I think Deputy Director of the CIA, Marcy Siegerson,
would make a terrific Secretary of State.
Someone I could easily liaison with.
Well, I was hoping that
you would be on my cabinet, in some capacity.
I'll be operating out of the region.
It's where my strength lies.
There are better people who can take it from here,
advise you on the home front.
And Ms. Harvey, LeAnn, we need to move you.
Uh, just for now, of course.
It was my understanding that...
Right now a more seasoned Chief of Staff
would send a strong message
to the Congress and to the nation. For now.
She'll do it. She'll send in the troops.
I'll be in Dubai by tomorrow afternoon.
And our deal stays in place.
Yeah, hold on a second.
  Ready?   Go ahead.
Yes. Ms. Harvey has her gun back.
Macallan's files are with the president.
Any hard evidence connecting you to the election...
is in her hands.
Then LeAnn's job is done.
If you have anything to say, now is the time.
What do you think happened?
I'd prefer you tell me that.
Humor me. You asked for this meeting.
What do you think happened?
I believe Zoe Barnes was investigating
a relationship you were having with Rachel Posner.
And somehow, that knowledge would endanger
Francis Underwood, who you would do anything for.
But did anyone think about the life of Zoe Barnes?
You know, you think you can erase something.
Then you find out that's not possible.
Tom, my attorneys didn't even want me to speak with you.
I'm sorry, there's just nothing more to say here.
I don't know what happened to Rachel Posner.
But I don't believe you killed Zoe Barnes.
Is this you in this video?
Looks like me.
I've thought long and hard, Francis.
Barely slept.
That's the job.
I'm going to send in troops.
I'll be announcing it tomorrow night.
I think you're doing the right thing.
Do you hate it here?
Oh, you know I don't like hotels.
An approximation of home just to remind you you're not there.
Well, we don't live in a home.
We live in a house, borrowed and temporary.
Something in your eye. A look.
It's changed.
We're the same now, you and I.
  How so?   You know how.
It's been a long time since I surprised myself.
You'll recover.
You're the most powerful woman in the world, Claire.
Comfort pales by comparison.
I'll announce it during the speech, after the troops.
A full and unconditional pardon...
for Francis Underwood and any crimes he might have committed
against the United States while president.
I'm glad to hear that.
It was never in doubt. I just needed to think about how.
So how long does this arrangement last?
For the time being.
How did we get here, Francis?
Oh, let it go. It's done.
Oh, and one word of advice.
Whomever Usher offers up to you as vice president,
that's the person that you're really gonna have to watch.
I won't choose anyone I can't manage.
Southwest corner of the building. Maintain visual.
Copy that.
Frag out!
There's Ahmadi. I have visual on Ahmadi.
  I see him.   Go, go! Fire!
I made a terrible mistake.
What did you do?
I don't even know what I'm doing here. I, uh...
This morning I started driving. I... I got scared.
Anyway, I'm on my way back. Can I come see you?
Yes, please.
Sometimes you don't have to watch the whole movie
to know how it ends.
The speech is gonna play well with both parties.
Where are we with the Republicans?
Trading names when it comes to your cabinet.
We have our generals, which is good.
Some corporate types, outsiders.
Make you seem like a renegade.
Corporate, from where?
Oil, banking, mostly. Some tech.
Occasional D.C. lifer sprinkled into the mix
to make sure the trains run on time.
I was going over our list for vice president.
Yeah. Hold on.
this will seem unexpected,
but a lot of the people I spoke to suggested me.
You're not a politician.
Exactly.
But I could be by your side.
Most of the Hill and the Senate would not come near us.
I'll take it into consideration.
It's beyond that. You'll need me.
Excuse me?
I can help. Look...
It is the way to keep you in power.
And keep your secrets.
Good evening.
I'm here to report to the American people and the world
that early this morning,
Special Forces killed the ICO terrorist
Ahmed Al Ahmadi.
We got him.
We got him.
Now, there comes a time in every president's tenure
when he or she must face the question of whether or not
to send young American soldiers into harm's way.
In my case...
that time has fallen within the very first days of my presidency.
Russian President Viktor Petrov collaborated with the Chinese
on illegal oil exploration in Antarctica.
Recently, we have learned that he has sent troops
to fight alongside the Syrian regime,
assisting them in the destruction of the Syrian nation.
These forces are using chemical weapons on their own people,
torturing the opposition,
and starving huge segments of the population.
The Syrians are a people besieged.
Let them not also be forgotten.
The time has come for our outrage to be turned into action.
Five months ago, my husband
addressed the House of Representatives
and asked them to declare war on ICO.
Congress failed him.
Congress failed you.
ICO extremists want democracy and America itself
to die a fiery death.
We cannot allow that to happen.
We can't wait for Congress any longer.
We gave Congress every chance.
She isn't going to say it.
Now, history judges every leader, every president,
by how he or she treats his or her own people.
A regime that would target hospitals, refugee camps,
schools or bread lines
in order to retain power must be confronted.
A leader that would sacrifice
the physical and emotional well-being of his citizens,
that would treat his people as pawns,
just to stay in power? Well...
that leader needs to be stopped.
If she doesn't pardon me...
I'll kill her.
Thank you and God bless this great country.
Well, the calls are coming in already.
Well done. This'll be a good night for you.
Nothing from Moscow yet.
Right now I just need some time to myself.
Do you know Tom Yates?
not personally. Why?
He hasn't been around in a while.
I don't know, forget it.
What?
I've been calling him. And he usually answers.
We demand justice, we demand peace!
No more war in the Middle East!
We demand justice, we demand peace!
No more war in the Middle East!
We demand justice, we demand peace!
No more war in the Middle East!
We demand justice, we demand peace...
The anti  war demonstrations outside the White House
finally got out of hand.
You've reached LeAnn Harvey. Please leave a message.
One of the protesters made his way over the gates.
As he was running across the White House lawn,
Secret Service agents moved in,
tragically shooting and killing the man.
You've reached LeAnn Harvey. Please leave a message.
Hey, where are you?
I'm sorry, ma'am, it's just not possible tonight.
We can't secure the run.
The level of threat at this point is just too high.
  Okay. Thank you.   Yes, ma'am.
My turn.House.of.Cards.SE
What did the girl say to you?
She said she hopes I die and that you become the president.
I want a woman in the White House.
We need you to implicate yourself in the death of Zoe Barnes.
I don't think your husband should be front and center.
What I want is for Francis Underwood to go to jail.
I'm guilty.
I killed Zoe Barnes.
You have all used me far long enough.
So I shall resign the office of President of the United States.
You made me look absolutely ridiculous.
  No! Claire.   Ill-prepared and ignorant.
We're a few hours away from my official resignation...
and you still have not agreed to pardon me.
I was going over our list for vice president.
A lot of the people I spoke to suggested me.
It's hard to know who to trust these days.
If she doesn't pardon me...
I'll kill her.
My turn.
Stop. Claire Hale. Stop!
"I'd like to fry her eyeballs.
If no one else steps up to kill the president, I will.
I'd enjoy it."
A tweet out of North Dakota.
What else?
"God never intended a woman to rule this land.
She is the anti-Christ.
  And a Jew."   A Jew?
  Do we really need to hear all of this?   Yes.
An unpublished editorial.
Someone pointing a gun at your likeness.
Lots of other online stuff, including a...
contest...
For?
For the most creative way to kill you.
And the winner?
Rather not say, ma'am.
I want to hear. Just hand me the report, Rick.
It involves, essentially, skinning you.
Cutting your body into dozens of pieces
and arranging them in the shape of the American flag.
Flesh for the white stripes, blood for the red.
What else?
Lot of threats involving the C-word, ma'am.
Lots and lots of the C-word, unfortunately.
  You mean Claire?   It's a long list.
If you really want me to, I'll  
Listen, I am not the first president to face threats.
I know with Francis, sometimes there were several a day.
Is it about the same
what we're dealing with here?
It's...
significantly up.
By how much?
There are roughly four times as many threats
on any given day since you took office.
Now it's twice that since Francis died.
I thought everyone loves a widow.
Not if she's also Commander-in-Chief, I guess.
These are not rational people, Madam President.
But, ma'am, as far as today's threat,
regarding your first scheduled appearance  
We're canceling the appearance.
We're not canceling.
It's a military base.
That's got to be the safest place on Earth for a president.
An anonymous soldier has made a serious threat  
"To shoot me in the cunt
on behalf of the United States of America."
Yes, Mark, I heard.
The threat's unconfirmed.
He says he's among those shipping out today.
Anyone can claim that.
And that you have no right waging war in Syria.
You, in particular.
I think we stay away. Rick, don't you agree?
There's no proof the threat is credible. Isn't that right, Rick?
Our intelligence division is investigating,
and the advance team is already there,
but it'll take at least a day
to comb through that base.
I think what the vice president says is the best course.
Maybe by tomorrow you could  
Tomorrow is the fifth of July.
  Yes, ma'am.   So what do you suggest I do?
Wish the nation a happy belated birthday?
Our only concern is your safety  
We're not cancelling.
I am sending those soldiers onto a battlefield.
The first female president of the United States
is not gonna keep her mouth shut on the Fourth of fucking July.
Lieutenant General Gallagher would understand.
I could appear instead.
  Speak for you.   Stop.
Is it my safety that concerns you,
or my potential endorsement of Gallagher?
Your safety first, of course.
But singling her out, that's a provocation.
And so?
I can't provoke them?
You're forwarding a candidate the Shepherds are against,
in their home state.
  After months of negotiation.   This is not a negotiation,
this is an ultimatum. Sign the bill or what?
Or what, Mark?
When Francis was looking to finance his foundation,
why did you point him towards Bill and Annette?
I didn't. Raymond Tusk arranged it.
Or maybe they reached out to him?
I don't remember.
I   What does it matter? They're working with you now.
I need to meet with the Shepherds directly.
Madam President.
I'll see them before my appearance at the base.
  You can't.   I what?
I'll let them know.
Thank you.
You're due at the base by :,
.
The fireworks show begins right after nine.
And the Examiner would love your okay on the photos.
Is there any progress on the source of the sound?
The GSA is still looking into it.
They're checking the floorboards above and below,
  in case there's     I don't want to wait anymore.
Please tell the executive housekeeper
I'd like the former president's belongings packed up.
I'll have it taken care of.
It's not true what he told you all those years ago.
That there are two kinds, useful and useless.
There's only one kind.
Pain is pain.
Francis...
I'm done with you.
There.
No more pain.
You do this all day?
I'm under psychiatric observation, Seth.
This is what you do.
Who's your new tailor?
You gotta look the part.
So, when do they decide
whether you're crazy or not?
Because if you're not,
you should come work for us.
Us?
Have you been working there for about five minutes?
It's been a month, actually.
So his body wasn't even cold.
It's what he would have wanted.
The Underwood Foundation was basically gonna be modeled after
the Shepherd Freedom Foundation.
I don't need the job.
Well, for a confessed murderer, you're pretty confident.
I'm about to be pardoned.
Pardon?
You really think that she's gonna give you one?
As usual, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
You know, there wasn't the kind of crowd that you'd expect for him
down there in Gaffney.
He wanted to be buried in Arlington.
Not next to his father.
That's not what his wife said.
Tell me something.
She even shed a tear?
You know...
I'm almost envious, to tell you the truth.
That even beyond the grave,
you'd do anything for Francis Underwood.
Doug, do you have my lighter?
Much obliged.
Was that who I thought it was?
Fred Amburg? He went off the deep end?
Everyone has problems, Seth.
Especially the ones who think they don't.
  Claire.   Annette.
Oh, did you get my note?
Oh, I haven't had the courage to read the condolences yet.
It's good to see you finally out and about.
Oh, what you've been through.
You know all about it.
Well, for a long time, I pretended he was still alive.
Out of town.
It was our son Duncan that really saved me.
Of course, we weren't married anywhere near
as long as you and Frank.
Claire Hale.
Nine years.
Late spring,
Sun Valley.
You look exactly the same.
Well, it's cities that age you,
it's what I tell everyone.
I hope you don't mind
saying hello to a few of our closest friends.
They're just here for a cocktail before the  
the sun goes down and the rest of the party shows up.
My sister's fireworks show have become a bit of a tradition.
Don't worry. They know how to be discreet.
Scotty here just got his hands on Nexis Security.
I heard you are speaking to the vice president about this.
It's a company of peacekeepers, mostly.
Oh, tremendous potential to create global partnerships.
Your husband helped me secure the deal.
I wanted to bring him onto the Board.
Bill was saying...
Yes, I was just saying.
Why in the world do they play
the " Overture" at a fireworks show?
It's Russian, for Chrissakes, in every sense.
This is Tabitha.
Peters, I know.
Frank...
  Wasn't he planning to be here today?   He was.
You must miss him terribly.
I had some long and hard-fought conversations with him.
He was going to help me resolve this AFL-CIO thing
that's been going on forever out in Nevada,
with your help, of course.
When the union stands in the way of innovation,
it's sentencing itself to death.
I do admire the way you hang on to your party.
Your loyalty.
Did I hear that Lieutenant General Nancy Gallagher
will be appearing with you later today?
I think she'd make an excellent candidate,
if she decides to run, of course.
Oh, she's going to run.
The president is on a tight schedule.
Excuse me.
Well, this is a surprise.
You know how Midwesterners feel about those.
Oh, don't listen to him. It's about time you came out.
Seems we have some things to discuss.
Yeah.
Well, as far as this special election is concerned, Claire,
you need to know that the soon-to-be-retiring Miss Gallagher
is out of question.
And I'm happy to see we're both fans
of the Declaration of Independence,
unalienable rights and all that.
But it says down here in the speech you're gonna give later  
Miss Gallagher has my support.
I believe Mark conveyed our concerns.
And communicated mine, I hope.
She's a tax and spend Democrat underneath that uniform.
  A patriot with a pristine resume.   Claire.
Who is very vocal about keeping private contractors
  away from US military operations.   Even as a negotiating point,
you can do better than her.
And I am tired of these delays, Madam President.
It is time for you to deliver.
  Your husband and I had an agreement.   Francis is dead.
  Promises were made.   Not by me.
Just like you, I like to negotiate my own agreements.
And make no mistake about it,
the lieutenant general is not an anomaly.
I know that. I've seen your list of candidates for the midterms  
Yes, mostly women.
I don't care what sex they are.
And for the record, nobody loves women more than me.
But this slate of yours, it will bankrupt the country.
They will set us back a generation. They will completely  
Support me and what I stand for.
And what is that?
  Oh, come on, Bill.   No, no. Tell me.
I wanna know. What's your mission?
  I wanna know what your platform is.   Oh, please.
I know you'd like to drown DC all at once.
But I'm gonna tell you right now, I cannot let that happen.
I still believe in government
and its ability to make the everyday lives of its citizens better.
  Yeah.   You don't wanna support my slate,
that's fine.
  Claire...   All I ask is stay out of the way.
There's a bill sitting on your desk.
A bill that took years...
and money to get passed.
You sign that,
and I know I got a friend in the White House.
If not...
  Then I don't.   Enough.
Nothing good happens to you when she's around.
Nothing.
Why did you come out for Francis?
For his foundation?
I don't think you ever really liked him.
Probably never respected him. Why back him now?
Because he gave us you.
Tell our friends I'll be back down in time for the fireworks.
Just so you know, I always liked Frank.
His desperation.
I'm sorry you can't stay.
I do enjoy curating our little show.
I collect a variety of fireworks shells as I travel.
Italy, Spain, China.
Do you know what the hardest color to make is?
  Red?   No, red's easy.
White's easy.
It's blue.
Very tricky chemistry involving copper and heat.
A truly bright blue is extremely elusive.
Whatever Francis promised or did...
is buried with him.
No, I know.
We all need to let him go.
Start from some kind of scratch.
Though it must haunt you,
the fact that he died next to you in bed.
Hon...
be patient.
Are you saying, she doesn't like the name?
I think she finds it incomplete.
What's wrong with the Comprehensive Safety Act?
Comprehensive Chemical Safety Act?
Or we could go back to the Smarter Safety Act.
Would she like "smarter" better?
No, we need a good acronym.
Mr. Vice President?
Mark?
Yeah. Agreed.
At one point, we talked about the Repeal Unsafe Regulation Act.
That's RURAL if we come up with an L.
Legislation?
That doesn't make sense with the rest of it.
"RURAL" is too hard to say. "SAFE" is good.
Safety. Future.
  I like "FUTURE."   Federal Universal Toxic and Unsafe...
  Regulation Eradication.   Okay.
  The FUTURE Act.   That could work.
May I ask, Mr. Vice President,
does her hesitation go beyond the name?
She'll come around. I'm guessing...
by the end of the day.
Because in one form or another,
this bill has been on her desk since  
She'll sign it, Henry.
Bill.
What do you want me to do?
Yank her from her own military base?
When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary
for one people to dissolve the political bands
which have connected them with another,
you just have to do it.
Sever the relationship.
Our nation's founding document,
the Declaration of Independence  
America's independence  
was hard-fought and hard-won.
Are you still there?
Our Founding Fathers imagined a nation that was free.
Free from despotism.
Free from absolute tyranny.
Free from an oppressive king.
Do you miss Francis?
Tyrants come in many forms.
From the American oligarchs
trying to change the very fabric of our society,
to autocrats threatening from abroad.
Now, each one of us has to defend our destiny.
And as I see it,
the fight against tyranny is the only justification for war.
My first  days as president have been difficult.
I lost my husband.
We were about to celebrate  years together.
But I know what he would want.
For me to stop mourning and carry on.
With the help of women like Lieutenant General Nancy Gallagher,
my presidency will not rest.
Nancy has been an inspiration to me.
A tireless warrior.
I promise her and all of you
that I will work on behalf of the rights
and freedoms earned over the last  years of our democracy.
As I look into the eyes
of you brave soldiers standing before me today...
Here's the thing.
I'm feeling so proud right now.
Proud to be your Commander-in-Chief.
Whatever Francis told you the last five years,
don't believe a word of it.
Our country is  years old, my friends.
Let's wish this great nation a happy birthday.
Say it with me.
Happy birthday, America!
Happy Birthday, America!
It's going to be different for you and me.
One more time.
I'm going to tell you the truth.
Happy Birthday, America.
  Thank you for your service.   Thank you.
Thank you for your service.
  Thank you for your service.   Thank you.
I want you to know how wonderful it is to be here and meet
all of you new recruits.
So, thank you.
Thank you for your service.
  Thank you.   Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you for your service. Where are you from, private?
Kalamazoo, Mr. President.
  Excuse me, Madam President.   That's quite all right.
I actually hate "Madam."
Makes me sound like I'm running a brothel
and not a country.
  Thank you for your service.   Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you for your service.
And where are you from, Pvt. Burton?
South Bend, ma'am.
Oh, I love Indiana.
I enlisted right before you took office.
Well, I promise you and every woman in this country
that during my presidency
the key components of the Equal Rights Amendment
will finally pass.
I'm going to make sure of it.
I want you to know I support you.
Do you even have a plan?
What did you say?
One that won't get us all killed?
Oh, man...
Would you have asked me that if I were a man?
Madam President!
One question, please!
How much longer till we get to the plane?
Just another  minutes or so, Madam President.
Okay, thank you.
Shit!
  Is she shot?   Stay down, stay down!
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Are you okay, Madam President?
  Are you all right?   Yes.
Lone Star is safe.
Sir, someone just tried to kill the president.
I just got the alert. Is she all right?
This way.
Lincoln,
Garfield, McKinley,
Kennedy.
Successful assassinations, total of four.
The attempts   Nine?
Jackson, both Roosevelts.
Truman. Ford twice.
Reagan...
the first Underwood and...
I will say, whoever tried to kill me,
perversely,
it's the first sign of real respect I've gotten in  days.
Somebody tried to kill her.
Bill.
Can you blame them?
The Underwoods have always been hard of hearing.
She's not him.
No, no.
She is not.
You know that better than anyone.
Is it public?
Secret Service shut it down. Standard procedure, apparently.
Threats beget threats.
Bill...
were you behind this?
We're gonna miss the show.
  How are y'all?   Madam President.
Hi, I'm so sorry.
I want to apologize for the late departure.
I know you all have families and festivities waiting.
Madam President, may I ask what happened?
The Beast was re-routed due to security concerns.
It's pretty routine.
I know it's been a while since I've been back here.
I just wanted to wish you all a very happy Fourth,
even if you're gonna be celebrating it on the fifth.
I'm so sorry.
Your speech, afterwards with  
Yes, the new recruit.
If a new recruit, especially a female one,
can't speak her mind,
I don't know what kind of country we actually are.
And be sure to tell us if you run out of beer.
Because I am sure there's a couple of cases
left over from the Carter administration.
And you're new.
Yes, ma'am. Melody Cruz.
I'm with Beltway Television.
Well, I hope everyone is making you feel at home.
Very much so.
It's an honor to finally meet you.
I'm a bit overwhelmed, sorry.
  Don't worry, I don't bite.   No, I know.
It's strange, I was supposed to interview your husband.
It was scheduled for a few days after he died.
It was going to be an exclusive.
We'd had a number of pre-interviews.
Questions we'd agreed on.
Questions like?
Like, was the president going to pardon him?
And when?
Will you? Even now, posthumously?
I know you did an exclusive with The New York Examiner,
but I'm guessing that's only going to scratch the surface.
I bet you have more to say
  about the state of your marriage     Miss...
Cruz, is it?
I don't know if anyone's told you,
but when the president visits this part of the plane,
it's usually considered off the record.
But you can ask my press secretary anything you like
once we're back on the ground.
You're especially quiet this evening.
Maybe I'm a little agitated.
Our patients don't do too well when it comes to fireworks.
Pardon me.
Yes?
I don't understand why you leave that on when we're meeting.
Well, it's not like you're saying anything different or new.
Your dedication to your script would be admirable
if it weren't so concerning.
In a few weeks, I'll be appearing at a hearing
regarding your state of mind
and when it comes to your confession,
even a guilty man changes his story now and then.
Who do you answer to?
I mean, who do you work for?
You.
That's the idea, anyway.
Everybody works for somebody.
I worked for a man who refused to fail.
I respected that.
I appreciated it.
I'd be dead without him.
Why?
I was working as an aide for a congressman.
He was idealistic and naive.
Had one-term written all over him.
But I needed a job, a place to be.
I was barely keeping it together.
Francis and I met at some function.
You know, the kind you stand up at.
I don't know how he knew, but I had eight bottles in my trunk.
I got through four that night when he came to my door.
I don't remember much.
Not clearly.
He took me to his home.
But Claire...
Francis got me dry.
I shook so badly I thought I was gonna die.
And then when I was finally got clean,
he gave me my first job.
As an aide?
Sort of.
He asked me to go talk to Congressman Kyle from Iowa.
To what end?
To persuade him.
And I did.
But Claire...
The way she treated him,
in life and in death...
But you pay a price, when you work for somebody like him.
Somebody you owe.
Somebody close to me died in a car accident.
That's how I broke the terms of my house arrest.
I went to see the site of her wreck.
It was twisted on the side of the road.
I just stood there.
An accident?
So they said.
And Zoe Barnes?
I killed her.
For the president.
That's what he used to do when he won.
What did he leave you with?
Last thing that Francis gave me was
the letter opener from his desk.
I mean, I chose it, but...
But I guess really the last thing he gave me was an apology.
I spoke to him the night he died.
My presidency will not rest.
Nancy has been an inspiration to me.
A tireless warrior.
I promise her and all of you
that I will work on behalf of the rights
and freedoms earned over the last  years of our democracy.
Tyrants come in many forms...
Pathetic.
From the American oligarchs trying to change the very...
Are you sure you don't want to take an hour or two to  
Mark. I'm inside the White House.
There's only two of us in the Oval, so unless you're packing,
it's literally the safest place I can be.
Well, I'm not packing, Madam President,
but no one would fault you for taking a breath for a minute.
I'm breathing just fine.
Can we keep news of this contained?
I've taken every possible step, I think.
So who is he?
Well, they did forensics on the route.
Compared notes with the aerial detail.
Homeland Secretary and the Bureau were brought in.
He never left the place he took the shot from.
Can you answer a single question directly and simply?
He shot himself in the head
with his own US military-issued handgun.
And we're sure he's the one?
Yeah. Pro-militia. Anti-government.
Dishonorably discharged last year. All the typical markers.
Secret Service is confident.
And the Bureau's investigating.
How did Bill Shepherd get his hands on my speech?
What?
Well, the press usually gets it hours before.
It wouldn't be that hard to access a copy, I guess.
I won't be signing that today.
You went there to declare your independence,
and you declared war.
That was a mistake.
No, the mistake was I didn't hire a chief of staff,
and things are slipping through the cracks.
That's where I have to disagree with you.
We need to keep this circle small.
You know, Francis warned me about you.
I assure you, I serve at your pleasure, Madam President.
You need to stop meeting in my office without me.
Yes, ma'am.
Secret Service took the lead.
But do you believe the theory?
That it was a disgruntled service person who took a shot at me?
PID does.
I'm asking what you think.
It depends if it was a warning or an actual attempt.
Given the accuracy,
the shooter would have been informed enough to know
that a . caliber round wouldn't penetrate the Beast.
I think he wanted to scare you.
On behalf of someone.
Lots of people make threats against sitting presidents.
I'm starting to believe Francis was murdered.
Before he died,
he aligned himself with some very powerful people.
And I think they turned on him, and they wanted him dead,
and I think they want me dead, too.
Do you think that sounds crazy?
No, ma'am.
But I think we need to bring in Special Agent Bowman  
Of these people, these powerful families,
they advocate dismantling intelligence agencies.
CIA, FBI, Homeland.
You know that, right?
  Ma'am     We cannot bring
anyone else in at the moment.
I'm relying on you
the way I know my husband could.
So, please see what you can find.
Is it ever Nate
or always Nathan?
Nathan.
Like Francis.
For me, anyway.
Oh, have you spoken to Doug Stamper?
No.
I'm so worried about him.
He did things no one in this White House should be proud of.
Hey, Mom.
How many people do you have there?
Not many.
Nobody that interesting, anyway.
Her visit to the base.
Independence speech,
even the naughty soldier is playing well for her.
Her charmed life persists.
Tell Uncle Bill we should step up.
I can manage the narrative. De-charm her.
He won't like that.
He's not going to like any of it,
so what's the difference?
  I don't know.   Mom, just say the word.
Trust me.
Don't do a thing until I get back to you.
Can't even tell you're still in DC.
There are parts of this city that will always remain a secret.
I don't think I'll be welcome back
in the White House press pool anytime soon, FYI.
Doesn't matter.
She won't speak to me.
  An interview? Not after     She will.
Tonight, for the first time, he was forthcoming.
But still saying he's guilty?
Yeah, as always.
And did he mention Mr. Grayson by name?
No. He was just more distressed.
So he's getting worse?
Or better, he's finally talking.
But the idea of his leaving the facility anytime soon,
that's still out of the question. I mean, for his own good.
He's either guilty of the crime
  or psychotic for admitting to it.   Madam President,
Miss Shepherd is on the White House line.
Well, maybe it's time to give him one of the antipsychotics.
Possibly. But we'd have to consider his history of addiction.
By the way, in answer to your question,
it was a letter opener,
the last thing that Francis gave him from his desk.
Keep me posted, Charles.
And thank you.
Sure.
Are you prepared?
Excuse me.
Don't you remember? Andover?
Our prep school joke?
I'm prepared to fail the test.
Are you all right?
I'm sorry to call so late. I   I heard about what happened today.
These things have a tendency to leak out.
I'm worried about you.
It's bulletproof, the motorcade glass.
Did they catch the guy?
How do you know it's a guy?
It's always a guy, right?
What was it Bill wanted adjusted in my speech?
Something about...
freedom.
You're in my thoughts, Claire.
Thank you.
He's still with us, don't you think?
Who?
Frank.
We're so glad we got to spend so much time with him before he died.
He told us some fascinating things.
He's been on my mind.
Bill and I finally went down to Gaffney a few days ago...
to pay our respects.
Claire!
I shouldn't have let them.
I'm sorry.
Come on out now.
Are you still there?
Yes.
Help!
Help!
I know.
You want to know what really happened to him.
A man like Francis doesn't just die.
That would be...
what's the word?
"Convenient."House.of.Cards.SE
There's a bill sitting on your desk.
A bill that took years to get passed.
You sign that,
and I know I got a friend in the White House.
If not...
Then I don't.
This is not a negotiation,
this is an ultimatum. Sign the bill or what?
Or what?
  Is she shot?   Stay down, stay down!
Somebody tried to kill her.
Bill.
Were you behind this?
I won't be signing that today.
That was a mistake.
Who do you answer to?
I mean, who do you work for?
Well, maybe it's time to give him one of the antipsychotics.
Happy Birthday, America.
Whatever Francis told you the last five years,
don't believe a word of it.
He's still with us, don't you think?
We're so glad we got to spend so much time with him before he died.
He told us some fascinating things.
Stop. Claire Hale.
Do you miss Francis?
I want a Declaration, Roger. So we can send them in.
But, Madam President  
I have the Guard, FEMA and the EPA
mobilized and waiting on the outskirts of that town.
I just got off the phone with the refinery.
The leak is well on its way to burning off.
My understanding is that the air quality is dangerous.
The levels are somewhat elevated, yes,
  but the winds are in our favor.   And subject to change.
That's how wind works.
This will all be over in a day or two,
the idea of keeping these families out of their homes  
This is a prudent precaution
and on my watch, that's what I want to happen.
I don't think we should exaggerate the situation.
Do you remember where you were on election night, Governor?
Because I do.
You were going to lose.
Statistically, there is no reason you should have won.
Keep the phone away from your mouth
while you're thinking, Governor.
I can hear you breathing.
Yes.
I do believe I need to declare a state of emergency.
Of course, it's your call.
And I assure you,
you will have the full support of the federal government.
I promised myself I wouldn't be like him.
That was textbook Francis, wasn't it?
But he handed me over to them like a shaker of salt
and now they won't let go.
This is a wound of their own making.
Mr. Vice President?
Yeah, come in.
Do you need a moment, sir?
No, no.
What is it?
Okay.
Governor?
They said it was fine.
It smelled like rotten eggs and trash. That's all.
You could smell it coming out of the faucet.
And then my son, his   his nose started to bleed and I thought,
  "Is that related?"   Where is your little boy right now?
Now? He's in triage with his mom.
  He's my heart, that little guy.   No, I know. I know.
But, ma'am. If I may. You  
You have to tell us. Is this real or not?
Because at first they said that we don't need to evacuate,
and then all of a sudden that we should.
I want you to know everything is going to be all right.
I promise you.
We were relying on that plant to keep us informed.
Sir, you and your safety
is the most important thing.
In fact, all of the families of Bellport,
nothing else matters.
I want to give my thanks to Governor Olmstead
for his quick and decisive act this morning
in declaring a state of emergency.
We have FEMA, we have EPA,
the Ohio National Guard.
They're all here.
No one should ever feel unsafe.
In her own home.
And how is it you have no idea, Mark?
  It doesn't matter.   Oh, it does matter.
It speaks to this untenable arrangement.
Later, I said. Let's stay focused on our response.
She was all set to sign the bill this morning.
We had photographers, a press pool waiting, the whole thing.
  But she didn't sign it, did she?   I'm on my way there now.
Because she was too busy
manufacturing an emergency out of nothing.
Look, let's not forget who escalated this. Okay?
Excuse me?
If we're working together, Bill,
I need to be included in every decision.
Every one.
This conversation's over.
Oh, for God's sakes.
I'll join Annette in Bellport.
No, you won't.
One of you showing up on site is bad enough.
Annette, call me back.
Mark.
Mark, are you still there?
Yes.
Let me talk to him. I'll circle back.
Hello, everyone.
My name is Kelsey Stewart.
I'm the deputy press secretary,
and I will be taking your questions today.
Sarah.
Is it true that Governor Olmstead
was resistant to declaring a state of emergency?
The Governor did declare a state of emergency,
and the White House concurs.
Something very wrong happened in that plant.
Yes.
Arcas has been slow to provide any details
when it comes to the leak and explosion.
Not to mention the two lives lost in the accident.
Have they been cooperating with the White House?
Now that the president is on the ground,
it seems that, yes, they have been more agreeable.
That's not the real question, though.
Somebody might want to ask,
where is Shepherd Unlimited in all of this?
The Arcas Refinery is a subsidiary of the family's conglomerate.
Are you saying that the Shepherds
are personally aware of problems at the plant?
Who is responsible and how
is all the White House and the president
are trying to find out at this point.
Will this have any effect
on the regulatory bill on the president's desk?
The president will be speaking on that shortly.
Marcus.
Was the president planning to divorce the former president
in the days leading up to his death?
Let's...
  Mr. Vice President.   Morning, everyone.
I hope Miss Stewart won't mind me taking a couple of questions.
Mr. Vice President, one question!
Marcus, who's your source?
  Unnamed officials.   Nope. We don't do that anymore.
We need names. You have a name?
I mean really, where do you get this?
The former president
spent his last night alive
next to his wife in the White House. Period.
As for Bellport...
let's not jump to conclusions before all the facts are in.
What else?
We still going door to door, but it's really a precaution.
Are there enough beds?
We have a few church basements
and the local jail if we need more.
Whatever hydrogen sulfide there is left in the air
is already dissipating.
In a day or two, people will be back sleeping in their own beds.
You have to understand,
Madam President,
most everyone overreacts when it comes to chemicals.
We have years of experience  
And the men who died in the accident?
That's tragic, of course. They were valued employees.
Members of the community. There's no way to replace them.
And Bill Shepherd?
  Yes.   Have you heard from him?
I've kept him informed, as well as all of our partners.
Bill called me directly.
They're ready to do whatever's needed.
They're important to Bellport.
They built the local stadium.
Even this gymnasium. They contributed  
No, I'm well aware of the family's philanthropy.
That wasn't the question.
Yes, Mr. Shepherd has been monitoring the situation closely.
I would like to tour the area.
Is that a problem, Governor?
No, no, not to my understanding.
I was hoping to get you over to  
to where we set up our triage.
It might be best if we stick to the itinerary  
I'd actually like to see it for myself.
Unless, of course, you tell me otherwise.
No, of course not.
The guard marks the doors of the evacuees.
Pretty standard procedure.
Stop the car. I think I see someone.
Stop the car.
Madam President, we'll have someone circle back.
Stop the car now.
Damn it.
Is she safe?
Nothing is   safe.
Hello. Anyone here?
The boy could have lost an eye.
That's not how we treat people.
How could she?
My God, Elizabeth, stop it.
Am I raising a daughter or an animal?
They're the animals, the way they attacked her.
Oh, of course, take her side. Of course!
It's time she learned about the world.
Pretty girls have a responsibility to their beauty.
I'll bet she dared those boys.
Shame on her.
Why can't you just do as you're told?
Why, indeed?
Madam President! Madam President.
Madam President...
might be best if we head back.
So, the house is safe?
Drink it then.
I thought so.
  But what am I agreeing to?   I can read it for you.
I can read.
And what's this for?
That lets the app figure out
how we can be most helpful.
It can be tailored to your specific needs.
We want to keep you informed.
We want you to know what happens before it happens.
You can't trust the government to do that.
Hello, my name is Seth Grayson.
Nice to meet you.
I'm with Shepherd Freedom Foundation,
can I talk to you for a second?
Sure thing. I was looking at the pamphlet saying just...
It's the president.
Madam President.
Whose idea was it? To leave it on his bed?
Not here.
The Shepherd Freedom Foundation is here to help.
The federal government is here to help you.
Yes, Madam President.
The only way America's problems will be solved
is through alliances between government and private industry,
each doing its part.
The Commander in Chief and I go way back.
We do. And I know I have the full cooperation
from the Shepherd family.
The blatant disregard for human life
exhibited by companies like Arcas  
Arcas is committed to the safety of its workers.
And with the help of...
the right kind of legislation, like the FUTURE Act.
Which is under review at the moment.
Until then,
I am hereby moving the EPA's Criminal Investigative Division
into the Pentagon,
where it will enjoy the forces and the resources of our military.
And they will investigate this disaster.
I swear on my husband's grave,
I will find out what happened here.
Thank you for your support.
I wanted to leave it on your bed.
Don't be thick, thick I can't use.
Did she actually ask for a divorce?
As if that matters.
And if I'm asked to justify the question?
It was justified the moment they didn't have an answer.
The last thing the president wants
is to be talking about the former president.
Let me ask you this.
How did your mother feel
when the president yanked her hand away like that?
That's none of your goddamn business, Marcus.
  Recoil? Is that the word you used?   Yeah,
that's what I see.
  Are you kidding me?   No.
Are we really gonna waste time
dissecting a gesture between two women?
Nora's right. I was there.
There wasn't a recoil.
I gotta agree with Tom here.
For me, it's Annette Shepherd sort of manhandling the president
as a sign of victory, and then I detect a flinch.
A slight flinch, then recoil.
  Recoil? I mean     She's trying to separate herself
from the primary source of the funding for what was to be
  the Francis J. Underwood Foundation.   This is about culpability.
She went to Bellport to hold those responsible accountable.
Companies like Shepherd Unlimited have been hamstrung.
And that's why this bill on her desk is so important.
Legislation means nothing without proper enforcement.
Weaponizing the EPA is wrongheaded.
And it does nothing to make  
Instead of ascribing negative motives to her every action,
why can't we just accept that President Underwood
was out there being presidential?
She put the fear of God
into you and your new friends, Mr. Grayson.
Being "Presidential" means signing the bill
and modernizing antiquated regulations.
As if you would know.
What's that supposed to mean?
Her husband, whose administration you were a part of,
was about to  
Was in the midst of setting up a philanthropic foundation.
Her husband was about to be indicted.
Excuse me, there wasn't even a grand jury.
I have it on good authority
he was about to be indicted, and she was about to pardon him.
But she also wanted a divorce.
To save herself. Distance herself.
Because, come on. Are you telling me
she knew nothing of what he was up to?
  If he was guilty, she was guilty.   Tom? Tom,
I have great respect for you
and the work you've done at the Herald.
But are you even capable of defining her on her own terms?
I'm sorry. One minute she's playing the grieving widow
  and the next, she's riding on the coattails.   Case in point.
This may be an unseemly thing to say,
but it's quite possible
her husband's death was the president's lucky day.
You can say whatever you want in here.
Whatever your feeling, thinking.
I'm questioning your ability.
My ability?
To tell the difference between justifiable paranoia and  
Do you use the word anymore?
"Madness?"
What do you feel paranoid about?
Myself, maybe.
Why we do what we do and for who?
Who's more evil, Doctor,
the taskmaster or the tasked?
Do you feel like Francis Underwood betrayed you?
I guess I'm wondering who betrayed him.
Who do you think?
You?
I don't know if these sessions are helping me anymore.
Why are you trying to drug me up, Doctor?
I think you should consider it.
Clozapine.
You must know what that does to a person.
They're a newer class of antipsychotics, Doug.
The side effects
are not as sensational as some of the older ones.
You don't have to suffer like this.
From my understanding,
the side effects themselves can make you look  
And again, I'm asking you if you use this word "mad."
Are you fucking kidding me?
Pardon?
You're gonna talk to me about side effects
while you look at your fucking clock?
No, you're right. I'm sorry.
We're gonna have to take this up tomorrow afternoon.
This is a much bigger conversation.
No, I'm talking now.
I'm sorry, but your time is up.
I don't give a fuck about the time.
Mr. Stamper.
I'm glad that you finally decided
to take advantage of your time here,
but you know the rules.
I'm not going anywhere.
Mr. Stamper, please.
I don't want to have to call someone, but I will.
This is bullshit.
Your uncle is not happy.
Are you aware of how many of your sentences
start with you quoting him?
He's right.
This circus backfired.
  I thought you were wonderful.   Your uncle thinks
  we've made a bad situation worse.   Mom.
Now I'm the face of this thing.
Which we will use to our advantage.
She called us out by name.
We can spin it any way we want.
Work the Congress.
Even if she vetoes the bill, they can override it.
She overreacted.
  And it made a fool of me.   I'm telling you,
you won.
She thinks she did.
I know that expression, trust me.
She can't decide if she's Lady Macbeth or Macbeth.
  Your uncle takes it from here.   No.
This isn't personal for me,
not like it is for you and Uncle Bill.
You know he hates the spotlight,
for any of us.
Prefers an old school way of dealing with things.
  I...   And don't think you know everything.
Because you don't.
Let me talk to Uncle Bill.
He's taken a suite at the Hay-Adams.
Frank's old room.
It's Doug Stamper, Madam US Attorney.
  How did you get this number?   Don't hang up.
The next call I expect is from your lawyer. In my office.
You really shouldn't.
Mr. Stamper,
  this is highly     I'm going to recant.
Are you there?
Yes.
I'm going to lay out how it's going to go.
And you stop me at any point if I'm wrong.
But I'm going to recant.
Which means you're going to need a new prosecutor.
Because you're going to have to recuse yourself
so you can testify against me.
And this call we're on,
is not going to look very good for you.
Anything you say in court will be ruled hearsay.
And the judge,
if he's in a good mood, is going to ask for more evidence,
and you and your new prosecutor aren't going to have any.
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
This case isn't going to make your career.
The case that's going change your life
is the prosecution of Claire Underwood.
It's gruesome,
what's gone on here.
I checked all the log books myself.
I spoke with the executive housekeeper.
She interviewed the staff. Nobody knows anything.
So his ring just appeared on his bed by magic?
My feeling is,
it's not the fact of it that we should be focusing on.
But...
what it means.
Tell me, Mark. What kind of people dig up a man's grave
and remove a ring from his cold...
hard finger?
The same people that are generating this drum beat
about Francis' pardon and your divorce.
You are daring them.
You've turned it into a spectacle, and now they will not stop.
Believe me. These people will not rest.
You need to make amends.
For slighting her?
  For identifying them?   You have to give them something.
  I don't believe in the bill.   Oh, goddamn it!
This bill. Are you listening?
Do you want to spend the rest of your presidency
defending your dead husband,
defending his...
deeds?
Because they will make sure
that every waking and even sleeping moment
of your time in the White House is about him!
Make amends for the last hundred days.
Then you can have the next four years.
When you present the
scholarship at the Take Aim Club this weekend,
Annette Shepherd will be there.
She's on the board. They're all donors.
Appear with your old friend...
and sign this bill.
You know, I can help you...
with the Shepherds. I know how to talk to them.
And please, please explain to me why you thought...
putting that elevated intern
in front of the press yesterday serves you.
  Because she's honest.   I had Mitch Glazer lined up.
  He's got  years of     Because she's not Mitch.
Because I know you pushed out Sean.
Sean Jeffries had a hard time telling the truth.
Your truth?
Yes, the one that keeps you in power.
And now what?
We've traded his ambition for her navet?
I believe her.
And so will everyone else.
  I'm sorry, do you need me to     No, no,
actually, I was looking for you.
I wanted to apologize for yesterday.
No, please.
  I was happy to have your help.   Okay.
You know Sean's not coming back, right?
I heard.
The president must see something in you.
What do you think that is?
It was an amazing opportunity.
And I've heard there are
some wonderful candidates for the position.
Yeah.
Well, until then...
why don't you to continue on
as acting press secretary.
Of course. Yes, sir.
And thank you and the president.
Do you believe in her, Miss Stewart?
I do.
I ask because...
I want you to know there are powerful forces out there
that are invested in seeing her fail.
So you're gonna hear rumors. You're gonna hear innuendos.
You'll need to stick to your talking points.
Not get lured off-track with, what, salacious questions.
I understand.
Right now, I'm the de facto chief of staff.
So, if you need...
help or advice,
you know where to find me.
Good luck.
Thank you.
There's a fire burning in the Valley outside of Los Angeles.
So, the Foundation sends volunteers in,
we sign them up for the app.
How many signed up in Bellport?
In and around the area, close to , phones.
But beside the fires, there's flooding in the Panhandle.
It's been raining for days.
There's a pipeline that's burst in North Dakota.
And my nephew came up with this?
Well, it's based on pre-existing technology, but...
he saw the potential.
Essentially they're handing over their phones,
which as you know,
is basically an extension of the self at this point.
Duncan calls them "the sarcophagi of our souls."
We'll be crawling peoples' phones.
You get to decide what people see and when.
Did Frank take this room because of the view?
Yes, I think he did.
You respected him.
Did you fear him?
Yes.
But you always knew where you stood with him.
And her?
You never know.
Did the workers at the plant sign up for the app?
  Most of them did, yes.   Good.
Good.
I'm glad you're working with us, Seth.
Your perspective, when it comes to the Underwoods,
my nephew.
I appreciate it.
Retired agents?
They're freelance now.
Working for Nexis Securities. A lot of guys do it.
Apparently these two have been on the ground in Gaffney
for the last week or so.
  Hired by who?   We don't know yet.
But they're making enough so that one of them just purchased
a second home on the Chesapeake Bay.
They...
broke into your Gaffney residence, ma'am.
What? Where was Secret Service?
And why wasn't I alerted?
Because no one was alerted.
They left it completely untouched,
as far as anyone can tell.
How did you know anyone was there, then?
An insomniac neighbor
who spotted the light from a phone screen inside.
Taking pictures, I'm assuming.
My, my, my.
Night life in Gaffney certainly has picked up.
Started when I was a kid.
Whenever the opportunity would present itself,
I'd slip my hand into a coat pocket to see what I could find.
A stranger's pocket is a window into his soul.
And what did you find?
Condoms.
Mints. Keys.
Did you steal what you found?
Not the mints. Because that would be cruel.
Was that you...
on the way to the airport?
Were you trying to teach her a lesson?
  Talk to Bill.   Come on.
I already did.
  She's late.   Yeah, she's the president.
You know, you have a weakness for strong women.
No, really.
You think they need your help.
Really?
  Still?   No, no.
I chew now.
I just like to...
play with this.
Wait.
She's here.
Madam President, Duncan Shepherd.
  Hello.   Claire.
Annette.
I see you've met Duncan.
  Shall we?   Yes.
Don't ever recoil from me again.
Ain't  nifty?
I think the last time you dragged me into a bathroom,
it was to show off your hickey.
I don't think your brother is gonna let up, Annette.
Until he gets his ring kissed directly, I think.
Reminds me of someone you were married to.
No. Bill and Francis are very different people.
Agreed.
You know I slept with him once.
Your brother?
Your husband.
I know.
Interesting.
Though, come to think of it, I guess it makes sense.
What does?
That your marriage allowed for that.
Well, it was the ' campaign.
Francis was facing a robust challenger,
and there you were at some DC fundraiser or other.
It was at the Union Station,
  East Hall.   Yes.
And there you were, dangling your checkbook.
So, it sounds like a favorable transaction all around.
  Is that what he told you?   I never asked for details.
I mean, I was curious.
I really was.
He was a good kisser, I'll say that.
But then the rest was so underwhelming.
Felt like he wasn't all there.
Like, he wasn't...
all in, so to speak.
Of course, my first thought, and...
isn't this true of most women?
Was to wonder if it was me.
Was I somehow less skilled
than I like to believe I am?
Well, I can't really answer to that, Annette.
I can.
It was him.
And...
I bet it was never very different with you.
Even you.
The blonde goddess.
Even with you. Am I right?
It's really only dawning on me now.
The sacrifice you made.
I sort of pity you.
What you must have denied yourself all those years.
And this is where I tell you to shut your mouth, Annette.
You don't know anything about marriage,
much less mine.
Tell yourself whatever you want, Claire.
We both know the truth.
He's waiting for you down the hall in the prep kitchen.
My brother.
I can still do it by the way.
Can you?
Well, you missed dinner.
I can have 'em make you whatever you like.
I'm not hungry.
The secret here is how much
lemon juice you put in.
Balance out the butter.
People and hollandaise.
They think it tastes like money.
  A night at the hotel.   What where you looking for?
There's nothing in the Gaffney home of value.
Frank did things.
And you just, what?
Look the other way?
That shot you took at me, it's not like you to be so reckless.
You don't scare easy.
The future of our country is at stake.
Does that sound...
pat to you, naive?
No, not at all.
Do you think I don't have friends at the Pentagon, Claire?
You may want to make my four years in office miserable  
All I want you to do is behave, as promised.
You can dig up a ring or whatever else you can get your hands on.
But that doesn't mean
I won't make your time a living hell as well.
Raymond Tusk said about you one time,
some dinner we were at, he just said it  
This is where I'm supposed to be
a little bit afraid of the answer,
  I suppose.   He said, "I don't know,
whether or not she's a person...
or just playing the part of one."
And I thought it was so strange at the time, but maybe it's true.
Just...
unreachable.
I know it'll be hard for you.
But you're going to have to treat me as an equal, Bill.
What did you do with your husband's will?
It was a revocable trust.
All done.
I'm not talking about that one.
I'm talking about the other one.
The new one.
Bet Doug Stamper would love to see the contents of that one.
What's in there anyway?
That you would go to such lengths
to keep him from it?
Claire Hale has a secret.
Douglas Stamper is meeting with the US District Attorney
as we speak.
He's out, Claire.
And he's not going back in.
Now, you need my help.
Later tonight,
I'm going to watch you sign that bill
that's sitting on your desk.
"To the dead,
a kingdom means nothing.
They have their requiem and eternity."
That's Macbeth. The opera, not the play.
All you have to do now is just go on out there
with your oldest, dearest friend and...
hold her hand up high.
Madam President.
You don't really think the military is irrelevant?
I watched your confirmation
from my chambers for the UN.
Wasn't my finest hour.
Well, he who laughs loudest  
Or is it "laughs last"?
"Last." "She."
  Vincent Abruzzo.   Ninth Circuit.
I am no good at functions like this.
I tend to find a chair at these things
and sit in it for the rest of the evening.
  Madam President.   Yes. Well, it's been a pleasure.
Madam President, if I may say,
I'm so glad that we finally have a woman in the Oval Office.
The arc of history is long, but  
The reign of the middle-aged white man is over.
The Bill Shepherds of the world who won't let go, have to go.
Does anyone except you know about the document that came for him?
No, of course not.
Because if anyone else gets their hand on that will  
That is strictly between us.
We only just discovered that he was missing.
I put a call into the US Attorney and was just informed
charges have been dropped.
How is that even possible?
I thought I'd lost my phone a couple of days ago, but...
But now I'm certain that
he took it and reached out to make a deal.
I can have a grand jury impaneled
and we can be taking testimony from witnesses within a week.
Who do you have?
Secretary Durant?
And others.
I'm sure I don't need to talk to you about what's right or wrong.
But in my experience, most people, in the end,
will do whatever they need to, to save themselves.
Do you think you have a strong enough case?
That depends on you.
If I'm gonna put myself on the line,
I need to know you're going to win.
This can be a very unforgiving town.
I'm giving you a chance to start over.
  Come on.   I can offer you immunity
for your testimony.
But, Mr. Stamper, of course, I can't give you any guarantees
when it comes to your reputation or that of the former president.
You would have to testify in an open court.
That is the deal.
I should consult with my lawyers.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Stamper.
Join us in supporting the Dallas Scholarship Fund

Take aim.
Look at these marvelous faces.
The faces of our future.
And I am so, so honored
to be chosen to introduce to you
the President of the United States, Claire Underwood.
I look at these brilliant young women
and words fail me.
What's this?
They gave us these. What are they gonna do?
Yeah, I'm not drinking the water,
no fucking way, I'll tell you that.
I'll go all the way to Canton to buy it, if I have to.
And... Mr. Grayson,
what else did he tell you about the app?
Nothing. You can go online and check it out.
'Cause a lot of people I know
signed up for it even after the president left.
He said...
Mr. Grayson?
Yeah, him.
That they were gonna tell us what was gonna happen
  before it happens.   How?
Look, I don't know.
Ithaca's, like, where?
There's one in Greece.
And the other's in upstate New York.
Guess which one I'm from.
It's a paper, it comes out once a week.
It was going to happen,
because it happened before.
We complained all the way to the EPA, but...
whatever.
Only this time the explosion was bad.
And yeah, some guys died. And the company knew.
They knew.
Welcome home.
Good timing. I just put on coffee.
A little late for coffee.
Well, we have so much to talk about.
I'm glad you're out, Doug.
I don't know what you were doing in there.
How's the US Attorney?
Secretary Durant's negotiating her appearance.
And if...
Cathy should somehow be dissuaded?
  Silenced?   Then it all goes away.
Yes, but they'll still want to know
who knew what, when.
I feel pretty clear.
You think it was me who asked you to take the fall
  just because I said the words, right?   He told me it was you.
  He whispered it in my ear.   And you believed him.
Like you always believed him.
Well, here's what I believe. Zoe Barnes killed herself  
And I expected to be pardoned for the rest.
Since his death, my hands have been tied.
But I believe the universe has given us a gift.
I don't know what that means.
Well...
We both lost someone
who shaped the course of our lives.
For good, but also for ill.
And now here we are
unexpectedly free.
To take a different tack.
We can do whatever we want, Doug.
And we've been entwined, you and I,
like it or not,
for decades now.
But I think...
we deserve to go our separate ways.
The only problem is
we have something urgent to attend to
called Cathy Durant.
And then we can finally be free.
Do what we really want.
Do what we need to do.
What does Doug Stamper want?
Are you trying to erase him?
Because you can't.
I'm not trying to do anything
except be the sitting President of the United States.
It's wrong to assume
Francis's ambitions directly aligned with mine, Doug.
The best way to not to be associated with his questionable deeds
is to do good.
That's what I plan to do, anyway.
Oh, you find that funny, do you?
Well, it's true.
I never understood what he saw in you.
I mean the outside, sure.
But the inside...
  LeAnn's death.   No.
You never cared for her.
It wasn't necessary.
And I told him so.
And yet...
Doug, do me a favor.
Close your eyes.
Please.
He wanted you to have them.
For this to happen at this point in your life,
the prognosis is not good.
I know.
Somebody killed Francis,
and yet they don't want him to die.
That last night, the last time we spoke,
was when I declined his phone call in the Oval Office.
It had been close to two months, and he was tired of waiting.
So he showed up here in the White House.
Like a thief.
It was terrifying.
He was furious, slurring his words.
"Why can't you do as you're told, Claire?"
I told the world that he died in our bed,
but that's not the truth.
I locked myself in my room that night,
woke up in the morning and found him dead in his.
They killed him to shut me up.
I need to bury Francis, once and for all.
Do you need help signing it?
No. Bill. Shepherd, enough.
I actually have one condition.
Put it back.House.of.Cards.SE
You are daring them.
You've turned it into a spectacle, and now they will not stop.
Believe me. These people will not rest.
You need to make amends.
For slighting her?
  For identifying them?   You have to give them something.
  I don't believe in the bill.   Oh, goddamn it!
This bill. Are you listening?
  Vincent Abruzzo.   Ninth Circuit.
I'm so glad that we finally have a woman in the Oval Office.
And we've been entwined, you and I,
like it or not,
for decades now.
We deserve to go our separate ways.
The problem is we have something urgent to attend to
called Cathy Durant.
And then we can finally be free.
Now, you need my help.
Later tonight,
I'm going to watch you sign that bill
that's sitting on your desk.
"To the dead, a kingdom means nothing."
I never had sex with a farm animal
or abused a girlfriend, unless you count marrying her.
Let me say, it was tough, uh...
narrowing down my ten most significant cases.
I prefer the smaller questions.
Of my professional memberships, my teaching.
Madam President, just between you and me,
my feeling is that it's not as far-fetched as some people say.
I still think there is a universe
where the ERA gets passed.
Women truly are the best, aren't they?
I am deeply honored to be considered for the late Justice's seat.
So, tell me.
How did they buy you? The Shepherds.
Judge Abruzzo, Madam President, I hate to break this up.
I have already taken
too much of the president's valuable time.
Madam President.
  Mr. Vice President.   Your Honor.
It has been a sincere pleasure.
I'll set up Judge Michaels for the end of the day tomorrow?
I have Secretary Durant waiting for you.
I felt emasculated.
Excuse me.
Bill Shepherd guiding my hand.
And you looked emasculated, Mark.
  You're mistaken.   No, I'm not mistaken.
I watched your face.
  Madam President    Please don't call me that. Please.
  Claire.   Better.
  Claire.   Yes. What?
That was not a fight you were gonna win.
  Do you like being the messenger?   What?
Has it been a dream of some sort since you were a little boy?
Because I can tell you something.
Once you identify the degree to which you are boxed in,
you'll see how liberating it is.
Are you with me...
or are you with those horrible, horrible people
you've attached yourself to?
Because I can tell you something about Bill Shepherd.
I could smell it on him.
The way I could on my father, on my mother.
He's sick.
  Well, he was.   He is.
And then where will that leave you?
With her?
Annette Shepherd?
I know what that woman is,
and more to the point, isn't capable of.
And that little encounter with the honorable Judge Abruzzo
at the fundraiser, that was orchestrated too, wasn't it?
Yes.
I look at him sometimes and imagine him at six years old.
Was he always so deliberative?
Cautious?
And I think in another life...
some other context
might we have been friends.
It's time to decide, Mark.
I hold every president to the same standard.
Are you making America better,
or are you making America worse?
That's all that matters...
Excuse me. Could you turn this off, please?
  Yes, sir.   The level of discourse in this city.
I'm telling you. She does have a point.
You need to tell Duncan
to be careful when it comes to his pit bull.
City.
FDR turned this place into a city.
With his agencies and armies of clerks.
All the professors that followed.
Before the war, this was just a small Southern town.
One built of marble, yeah, but just a...
small town sitting on a swamp.
Place to visit.
Place to...
protect the Republic.
Secure States' rights.
That's not what it is today.
Some top-down money grab for bureaucrats,
lobbyists and the entire Democratic party.
You've always been more Teddy.
Than that traitor pig Franklin?
Look, I know it's a sacrifice for you to be here, in Washington.
But for God's sake, why take the same room he was in?
Well  
Well, he wanted to keep an eye on her.
Francis never could let go of the White House.
But he did give us the opportunity we've been waiting for.
She's not qualified.
She stole the damn thing.
If ever there was ever a chance
to shrink the office down to size,
it's the presidency of Claire Underwood.
Maybe you should run for office.
I think that time has passed.
I'm worried about you.
Oh, don't be.
Never better.
Deregulation bill is the first of a hundred,
ready and waiting.
The speed you're moving at  
I can come back. The lawyers are due any minute.
No, no. Come on in here. Grab yourself a cup of something.
I know Annette wanted to talk to you in person,
before the rest of the team arrives.
I passed on what you told me about the president.
I want you to have it all before
Duncan got his hands on it.
She admitted to all three of the abortions.
But I can get you the names of the men. Who they were.
No, I'm not comfortable with this.
Let's take that off the table for now.
She'll play along.
We'll make sure of it.
I always imagined that if I were president,
I would want you to be a member of my cabinet.
You look like a movie star.
Oh, well, it's the glare. I get migraines since the fall.
  They can come on quite suddenly.   Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
The vice president said that you wanted to meet me in person.
It's so good to see you.
Sit.
Not everyone comes back from a fall like that, Cathy.
Yes.
I'm starting to feel like a proverbial cat.
Take off your glasses, let me see your eyes.
You have no shortage of stories.
You know that.
My memory's been very erratic lately.
Sometimes, I think I might just forget
the details of my time in office altogether if...
If?
Honestly, I would love nothing more
than to just move on, Madam President.
Well, I understand that you have a job offer.
Several. I'm lucky.
The Eisenhower Strategic Initiative, isn't it?
Yes, a think tank makes sense. Outside of government.
Well, not entirely outside.
And heavily funded by  
A coalition of industrialists and civic-minded folk, yes.
Big plans to change the world.
I haven't accepted.
But you want to.
You think I shouldn't take the job?
I think you should trust your gut, Cathy.
Take care of yourself.
Claire.
I'm sorry I didn't write after Francis  
Oh, there's no need to apologize.
I can still feel his hand...
on my back.
Cathy, he's gone.
Bill Shepherd got to her.
I can feel it.She's going to testify.
My lawyers tell me her team is still negotiating,
maybe for a while yet.
She thinks she's safe with them, with this job.
Instead they're gonna be sentencing her to...
It needs to look like complications from her fall.
I can have her detail pulled. I still know some people.
The opportunity will present itself.
One last piece connecting us both to Francis.
The world is either with us or against us, Doug.
You think you'll ever wear them?
Doesn't feel right.
Do you know the last thing he said to me?
"Promise me you and Doug
will take care of each other."
I want to thank the National Gallery
for curating this magnificent exhibit.
Our hope is, in due time,
these works of art will return to their rightful place
in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.
Mr. Nasser.
They're making a fool of you, these Shepherds.
The special interests. The go-betweens.
Your so-called peacekeeping in Syria was a shameless land grab
built on the lives of American soldiers you sent into battle.
Then you can blame Jane Davis, Mr. Nasser.
I do.
I had hoped to renegotiate
the deal Jane helped broker many months ago.
Now I know that's impossible.
Oh, because she's conveniently unavailable.
Because you're in no position to do so.
You've been excluded,just as I have.
They're stripping power from you.
Have you ever seen the Baathist playbook?
It was inspired by American intelligence agencies.
Sometimes, you need to be an insurgent in your own country.
Well, that's interesting. Because presently,
I'm meeting with a member of a known terrorist organization.
Pardon me. But I'm a lawyer.
If you allow American corporate interests
to cut ICO out of Syria's future  
Are you about to threaten me, Mr. Nasser?
No, but we all know what ICO is capable of.
I'm merely conveying a message from one of my clients.
You and your client are one and the same.
Americans have such faith in their ability to
keep things and people safe.
Mr. Nasser, Syria is a country of...
former schools, former homes, former places of worship.
Your organization played a large part in the destruction.
And so have you, Madam President.
I'm afraid I can't help you.
No...
you can't.
I got two daughters, a beautiful wife.
Paid my dues.
Four terms.
A Republican in a diverse district.
I got a ground operation second to none.
And my volunteers,
their sons and their daughters
are coming up right behind 'em. I just...
I just feel like, um...
this could be my moment, you know?
Fred told me about the legislation about to be introduced.
I'm co-signing.
  It's     Ambitious.
It's unprecedented.
It's bipartisan, is what it is.
You worked for her.
I worked for her husband.
Nobody wants her hands on a nuclear football.
Or sending any more uniforms anywhere, here or abroad.
You're gonna have to be okay with that.
Are you?
I owe her nothing.
So what do they have on you?
Hold on, slugger.
I'm still trying to get acquainted here.
  Right.   Where do you think you're going?
Fred Amburg asked me to meet you.
  Well, Fred asked me to meet you.   And we've met.
Where do you get off?
  After where you've been.   You mean where I was.
With Mr. Amburg.
The last person you worked for  
Became the President of the United States.
He pushed you out.
I am your chance.
You know, not that I have to prove myself to you,
or to anyone else,
but I can find the opening,
the crack, the weak spot.
I don't know,
maybe it's a curse to know what people fear.
Like you.
I think what scares you, Congressman.
Your base,
your ground game, all that love.
You thought you deserved it,
that it was meant for youand nobody else.
You got blind.
You forgot that they'd come for you.
But they will come.
That's how this business is built.
So, I'm going to ask you again.
What is it that they have on you?
My district covers O'Hare.
Pensions.
The baggage handlers. I  
Shit.
It was stupid.
Well...
it's only stupid if you can't make it go away.
Tom, calm down.
I'm getting too old to be polite.
Hear the deal out. Content will not be changed.
And you and I both know better.
Something happened that night.
Their marriage was broken,
he went over there.
I'm not saying they're connected,
but the next day he winds up dead.
She knew an indictment was coming.
Do you understand what that means?
Then keep writing.
So they can turn it into a  characters for clickbait?
We don't write anymore,
we come up with feed for the trough.
Put that goddamn thing down before I smash it!
You need to go back in there
and apologize.
To whom, Dayna?
Our new boss is a voice on a speakerphone!
He doesn't even know I walked out.
Why don't we write about how Gardner Analytics
is buying up television stations
and some of the greatest papers in this country?
"Analytics." Oh, my God.
What the fuck does that even mean?
According to the autopsy,
natural causes.
Heart attack?
Overdose of his liver medication.
Accidental, presumably.
  What aren't you telling me?   Nothing.
He would never do that intentionally.
Witnesses in the lobby of the Hay-Adams that night
said the former president was acting disoriented.
Did you share this with his widow?
She's the one who asked me to look into it.
She suspects the Shepherds.
He was with them a lot, but not that night.
  And who was?   Other than her?
That was her husband, Doug.
She's the president.
Don't you sound devoted, Nathan.
My only contact with her is in my official capacity.
Did you think you'd seen the last of me?
That's the last thing I thought.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Doug, here.
I tracked his comings and goings
back to when he left the White House.
I got my hands on the metadata going into his computer.
LeAnn Harvey's camera phone was streaming during the crash.
A direct feed to only one IP address.
Francis'.
His laptop.
It's not easy to watch, but...
  Okay.   Up to you.
Mr. Hammerschmidt.
Duncan Shepherd.
I'm sorry I couldn't be at the meeting in person this afternoon.
My walker drops him off when it's late.
Come.
You saw my little outburst.
I enjoyed it.
The outrage.
We need more of it.
I especially liked your appearance on television the other night.
Yeah. Well...
I get a little heated sometimes.
It's exactly the kind of exposure the Herald needs.
Tom,
you're now part of a conglomerate
with vast influence and reach.
The point is I can bring you whatever evidence you need.
  Hold on.   Divorce for pardon.
There's a kernel of truth to it, but your source...
And before you say anything, consider what I'm offering.
An opportunity for justice.
If you're talking about manufacturing evidence, Mr. Shepherd,
  I'm not interested.   Beg to differ.
And spare me the seasoned journalist routine, please.
Your  years in the business.
I've spoken to your old assistant, Angela.
She's written a piece about her time with you.
I could run it, or...
Your dogged pursuit of Frank Underwood, pardon the pun,
is now your pursuit of his bride.
Think about it.
Men your age, they unravel very easily these days.
Judge Vincent Abruzzo has the credentials.
The published writings, the public statements.
It all checks out. Full package.
So what's the hesitation, Madam Prez?
Beltway Television is owned by Gardner Analytics.
It's the latest brainchild of Duncan Shepherd.
So far, I've deflected
all questions regarding Ms. Cruz's commentary.
Good. Let's not dignify it.
No. That's fine, thank you.
They were a hazard, I couldn't resist.
Sorry I missed the funeral. Were there psalms?
Number .
I love .
Nasser had no business coming to you directly.
Well, I knew if I met with him, you'd suddenly appear.
He feels lied to, Jane.
Because he was.
We were never gonna give those bandits a seat at the table.
Jane, he's threatened more ICO attacks.
ICO is neutralized, mostly.
It's time to re-think our involvement in Syria.
Stand down, rebuild.
This deal is important for all of us.
Including the Shepherds.
Look, I'm no fan of that family,
but in the case of Syria, our interests align.
The next phase of our...
presence in the region
is more about the spoils than the peace.
The problem is Petrov,
whom the Shepherds and I despise.
What do you have on the Shepherds?
I'm sure one of the several agencies you're
involved with has something.
And don't you keep files on everyone you're dealing with?
Bill and Annette are very careful.
What about Annette's son, Duncan?
Well, Mark knows them more than I do.
I thought there were better options for a former president...
but Annette wouldn't leave Frank alone.
That's their problem, they don't know when to stop.
You know, when you left three months ago,
I wondered where you'd gone.
And then, I didn't think of you at all.
You say that.
But I detect pain in your eyes, Madam President.
As a deer longs for streams of water.
So I long for you, God.
Do you miss him?
God? Always.
I'd like you to move in here with me, Jane, into the White House.
I need your counsel
and your perspective when it comes to Mark.
The truth is that whole last year in the White House...
I just lost myself.
And the crazy thing is, I've never even met Zoe Barnes.
Is that what you told the US Attorney?
Or did you and Claire Underwood make a deal?
The president and I are on different paths.
You're saying you haven't seen her.
We've spoken.
I just don't see a role for me in her White House.
I'm working with Congressman Cole.
He's making a play for speaker.
I left the Herald today.
If that's why you wanted to see me,
  make a pitch for your new guy.   No.
No, this is about making amends.
  Last fall I started drinking again.   No.
You picked this place
because it's full of bloggers and Hill rats.
Right now, everyone here can see us talking together,
like civilized people.
As if I never called you a murderer in print.
Your latest article on Francis.
This story about the nights leading up to his death?
  You want to make amends?   Who are your sources?
Peter Russo.
Zoe Barnes.
LeAnn Harvey.
Doug, there isn't a shadow for you to hide in anymore.
The only person knows everything is you.
I don't.
Let him go.
I don't know what you're talking about.
At some point, you're gonna have to decide.
Claire Underwood, believe me,
she'll come for you when it's time.
Thanks.
You know, there's caffeine in that.
I do.
I love that you love Arnold Palmers, but  
Arnold Palmer was a great man.
She still on your mind?
This arrangement isn't working.
Which arrangement?
Mark, come to bed.
She needs to feel some degree of autonomy.
Fuck autonomy.
She serves at our pleasure.
I'm sure she feels undervalued.
Undervalued?
Claire Hale? Please.
What if Bill doesn't get better?
He is better.
If we don't play this right,
in the public eye, we are doomed to fail.
  You know that, right?   She's doomed, you mean.
Look...
Let's be clear.
I am not attracted to her, but she needs to see me as a partner.
And what is the rush?
Bill wants a majority on the court.
He's waited a long time.
Let her at least look like the president.
I'll scuttle the nomination if it comes to that later.
I want Judge Abruzzo, Mark.
And don't ever question my brother's ability
to function at the highest level.
What is that Sylvia Plath line?
"She eats men like air."
Who are we talking about?
Sorry we missed each other yesterday.
Well, my apologies for leaving you in the lurch again today.
Everything okay?
I spoke to Annette.
I really think this is the best course.
  Did you ever meet George?   George?
My brother George. Incurious George.
No, I never did.
And back in the old days,
we acquired an operation in the Midwest,
refining Canadian crude.
Profit margin was...
It was staggering.
But George,
he got all high-minded about it.
Thought that we were bending too many laws. So he  
He bought a rival company, green energy type,
and he sued us.
Sued us.
I mean...
The betrayal.
My father's true religion was family.
And he was troubled.
He was deeply troubled by what George had done.
Changed his will.
Any sibling bringing litigation
against any other at the time of his death
would automatically lose their share of the inheritance.
Every damnable penny.
He used that word.
Which is exactly what happened to George.
George couldn't believe it.
Accused me of tricking Dad into doing it
when he was too weak to know his own mind.
My father always knew his own mind.
George...
...he was just so broken up about it.
Didn't even contest the will.
Which as far as I see it,
it means he had no place inheriting
that kind of money to begin with.
The man had everything he ever needed.
He was just so...
Short-sighted.
Lives on some island in Maine now.
You know what the worst part for me was?
How much it upset Annette.
That was a no-go.
I'll get the nomination, Bill.
Bye-bye now, Mark.
They were good enough to
provide me with a direct feed from the Hall.
  Is this necessary?   Inhale.
You ever seen Giselle?
Don't look at me like that.
The results aren't all bad.
I'm being watched.
By whom?
Tom Hammerschmidt, the US Attorney.
It's a feeling that I've had for a while.
Hello?
I'm here.
It's too risky.
If Francis had asked, you'd have found a way.
That's true.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
I guess this is where we part ways, Doug.
It's for the best.
Then say goodbye.
You know what the last thing he said to me was?
"I can't imagine a world
with only one of you in it."
There comes a point in every relationship where you wonder,
"Are you with me?"
Are you?
So, there are some loose ends
that Bill Shepherd is trying to exploit.
One being...
Cathy Durant.
And I have known each other for a very long time.
I know.
Well, the last time I saw Cathy, she looked at death's door.
You can't ask that of me.
She trusts you, Jane.
She trusts you.
That's making a move in broad daylight.
I enjoy having you here.
I'll never be able to forgive myself.
And when you told him about LeAnn?
He showed no emotion, ma'am.
  Where is he now?   Still at home.
I have a couple of agents trailing him.
As far as the Bureau is concerned, it's for Doug's own safety.
And besides Congressman Cole, has he met with anyone?
Other than myself, Tom Hammerschmidt.
Perhaps you should be the one on him.
In case we need to find him alone at some point.
I continue to be very concerned about his state of mind.
Yes, ma'am.
Francis left him everything in his handwritten will.
Am I curious? Yes.
But not enough to wait for Douglas Stamper to bring me down.
Secretary Durant, Ms. Davis is in the back.
  Where's Sal?   He's off. My name is Giancarlo.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Right this way.
Very slow today.
Please.
I'm sorry.
  Madam Secretary, please.   I'm sorry, I'm  
Madam Secretary.
Jane, how could you?
How could you do this to me?
  Listen to me, sweetheart.   No, you listen to me.
Is this Claire?
Are you doing this for her?
Oh, Cathy.
Once the decision is made, you can't escape.
Maybe it won't happen today, but...
someday,
someday, I'm afraid.
I curse you.
I curse you and wish you a painful death.
Drawn out and excruciating.
I don't want to disappoint you.
That's not how I'm gonna die.
Well, we'll see.
Will we?
I've been thinking about the nomination.
You should go with Abruzzo.
We could get beaten up in the midterms
if the wrong signals are sent.
It's the way to be a two-term president.
There's still a lot we can accomplish.
You're such a strange animal.
You've never been comfortable in your skin
since you've been vice president.
Why did you even try?
I believe in you.
Well, that's not enough.
I'll leave you to your movie then.
What does Annette have to say about all this?
  I know you're close to her.   I won't betray her.
Just like I won't betray you, Claire.
They got us, you know?
We should make the announcement.
Abruzzo.
You can start the film.
She's already met with the EPA Regional Administrator,
looking for memos.
Hard disks have been scrubbed, and there's nothing in the cloud.
There's no paper trail, virtual or otherwise.
  Skorsky?   She was with the Herald.
She left when I joined the White House.
It's just a local paper. We can acquire it.
This isn't about the president grandstanding.
She's talking to someone.
  Duncan     We should save the app for the midterms.
Well, do you trust what you've built or not?
I don't want it exposed.
She signed up for the app.
We can get into her phone, take a look around.
Would you gentlemen excuse us?
No, stay. Bill.
She wants to see me.
Nope.
She says Mark is no longer a viable vice president.
He's not communicating her wishes.
She wants to deal directly with me.
She's in no position to demand anything.
My God.
You want to meet with her.
She's still the president.
Who had three abortions,
lied to the American people about one.
I told you, I'm not willing to use that.
Then you'll use the other thing.
What Mark told us.
Seal. The case was pretty typical.
Prep school drugs.
Duncan Shepherd was rich enough to get off, but the other boy,
not so lucky.
But...
the transcript.
  Fascinating read.   Painful, really.
Ms. Shepherd's here.
Oh, please send her in.
  Annette.   Claire.
  Jane.   Annette.
I'm honored we've graduated to a first name basis.
Surnames can be a burden.
That's funny.
I've always loved mine.
What about you, Claire? You gave yours up.
Exactly.
You feel more like an Underwood?
Well, like you said. Surnames can be a burden.
I like your...
  lady quotes.   What is woman?
De Beauvoir question.
That's right. From The Second Sex?
Remember that class, Annette?
How strange it was, as a teenager,
to be taught feminism by a man in French.
I hated that book.
Long-winded, for sure.
But you gotta admit.
She was right about everything.
Work with me.
Directly, without a middleman.
What use is Mark,
if he can't be effective?
Mark can be very effective.
Well, but both sides are unhappy.
The Supreme Court.
This is a choice
that outlives any presidency.
Exactly.
But also part of what defines a presidency.
Of course.
So I can't be...
I will consider any informed opinion.
But I... You understand.
The decision has to be mine, Annie.
No one calls me that anymore.
Your son, how old is he now?
Twenty-seven? No...
Twenty-eight. I always seem to make him a year younger.
He always did look young for his age.
Especially his juvenile mugshot.
Such a baby face.
So, you'll speak to Bill?
I don't need to.
You're the president. You should do what you want.
That's what I keep thinking.
Do you remember how much fun we used to have,
before we understood the rules?
Look, let's not let it all break down here, okay?
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you've never had a foothold
like this in the White House. So...
You want to save her or fuck her?
Either way, do it on your time.
Don't make it personal.
Don't insult me.
Shut her down.
Show it to her.
That's what Bill and I want. And you'll do it.
No.
  I'm not asking.   The fallout from that...
Not my concern.
It will be your concern.
You're on your own now.
  Oh, no, no, we're done.   Don't.
Annette.
The reign of the middle-aged white man is over.
The Bill Shepherds of the world who won't let go,
have to go.
The waitress who filmed
it works for the Shepherd Freedom Foundation.
They were hoping to use the clip
when it came to Judge Abruzzo's confirmation.
Okay, thank you.
Have you heard from Tom Yates, Kelsey?
No.
You were friendly with him, right?
I haven't heard from Tom in a long time.
And your coworkers, have they asked about him at all?
Now and then.
He used to roam around down there.
Everyone liked him.
Well, I had my national security team look into it.
And they tracked him down.
It seems he's been using his credit card
in and around Prague, apparently.
I'm glad to hear it.
No, because I was worried.
We used to talk a lot, and then it just stopped.
Did you ever read anything he was working on...
...besides the speeches he wrote for me?
No, just the early stuff.
Cathy.
Oh, Stan.
Oh, my God.
That's all for now.
When did it happen?
I'm so, so sorry.
No, the last conversation I had with her,
she was talking about her new job
and what a great opportunity it was going to be.
Madam President.
Forgive me for calling so late.
I've just been informed...
that Catherine Durant is dead.
It's an embolism, they're saying. Connected to her fall.
I want to thank you, Doug, so much for your help.
It's a shame.
It's a terrible shame.
Yes...
a terrible, terrible shame.
She will be missed.
Mark.
Apologies for disturbing your run.
What's happened?
  Can we have a word in private?   Of course.
It's okay, Steve. My detail cleared the area.
  Clear.   Okay, we're clear.
Where are we going?
You have  seconds.
I can get rid of this, or the cops will find him.
You've run out of options, Madam President.
I understand.House.of.Cards.SE
I can still feel his hand on my back.
Cathy, he's gone.
Bill Shepherd got to her.
She's going to testify.
Fred Amburg asked me to meet you.
Well, Fred asked me to meet you
I am your chance.
And besides Congressman Cole, has he met with anyone?
Tom Hammerschmidt.
Perhaps you should be the one on him.
He didn't fire me. I resigned.
I had some fundamental differences of opinion
with certain people in the White House.
Like who? The president?
The vice president, Frank Underwood.
Have you heard from Tom Yates, Kelsey?
  No.   You were friendly with him, right?
He's been using his credit card in and around Prague.
I'm glad to hear it.
Jane, how could you do this to me?
Is this Claire?
Are you doing this for her?
Once the decision is made, you can't escape.
Maybe it won't happen today,
but someday, I'm afraid.
Well, we'll see. Will we?
Oh, my God.
When did it happen?
The last conversation I had with her,
she was talking about her new job
and what a great opportunity it was going to be.
Brothers and sisters, behold, I tell you a mystery.,
We shall not all fall asleep,
but we will all be changed
in an instant, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet.
For the trumpet will sound
and the dead will be raised incorruptible,
and we shall be changed.
Almighty God,
remember the mercy with which you graced your humble servant.
Receive her, we pray, into the mansions of the saints.
As we prepare our sister's final resting,
look also with love on those who mourn
and give them comfort in their loss.
Grant this through Christ, our Lord, Amen.
Amen.
  Madam President, can I ride with you?   Of course.
Has he approached you?
Who?
Petrov.
Didn't he just arrive?
If the talks on Syria have broken down, what's he doing here?
It's either a good thing or a bad thing.
Well, which is it?
Madam President?
He was fond of Cathy.
I need to know that you won't stand in the way of my handling...
Mark. It's done.
You won.
It was necessary to show you,
but not what I wanted.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You did that to both of us. You did it.
You involved me, you implicated me.
  You left him in my house.   Mark, that's enough.
It doesn't matter anymore.
Stan, my deepest condolences.
This is Cathy's brother Hunter. He flew in from Eugene.
Just outside Lane County.
Beautiful country out there.
I was planning to come out anyway.
Stan's birthday is on the sixth.
Cathy and I have been...
back and forth for months.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Doug, this is Cathy's brother Hunter.
And you've met Stan.
  Of course.   Thank you for coming.
Doug, I think, spent more time with Cathythan anyone.
She didn't deserve this.
Honestly, it doesn't seem real.
Would you excuse me?
What time did she die?
I don't...
Sorry, I know it's a weird question. I just...
I had one of those feelings that day.
Yeah, right around then.
Mr. President.
President Underwood.
Secretary Durant was from a time that's passed.
Holbrooke, Albright...
They knew how to have a good meal and some friendly conversation
before diplomacy got ugly.
It certainly won't be the same without her.
I hear they have you on a short leash.
How could you let that happen, Madam President?
Now, when we're only moments away from crisis.
You know, in some cultures
it occurs to them to actually honor the dead.
Every seven years the Malagasy people
exhume the bones, wrapping them in cloth,
so they can dance with the bodies.
How does this town rise to the occasion?
It's like their heads are on a swivel.
Yeah. What do you call those things?
Bobble heads?
Terrifying.
No, don't... Let her be.
You wanted her to play the part.
Voil.
  The President.   the President is too agreeable.
What did you do to her?
I trust her contempt more than whatever this is.
Love, I know what you're capable of.
DIA believes there are over , Russian troops
  on their way to the border.   Did you find Bugayev?
As of a few minutes ago, his second in command assured me
that was the last contact
we would have from anyone at the Kremlin.
Except for him.
He's requesting a private meeting with the President.
  Sure.   God damn it.
  Mr. President.   Mr. Vice President.
You know Secretary Siegerson.
  Yes. Of course.   So good to see you.
Madam President, excuse me.
Oh, yes. Excuse me a moment.
Of course.
Cathy was kind to me.
A role model. Sensible, shrewd.
Fluent in French.
Repose en paix.
I know it's not the place, but...
this isn't normal, what's going on.
When I accepted my position,
it was to work with you and your agenda,
not...
not...
Certain members of our Cabinet
in positions related to National Security
have had several secret meetings regarding Syria.
President Petrov has become aware
of their plans for sending private contractors to the region.
Ma'am...
there are officials in the Pentagon,
people at the Kremlin, who would very much like to prevent
  a proxy war...   Nora, I appreciate your candor,
but Mark has this.
Ma'am, the Cabinet is his.
He knows what we need to do.
What makes me suspect you're vying for speaker is
the frontrunners change day to day,
but everybody's second choice remains the same.
  You.   Brett, are you saying you wouldn't do it,
if the party asked?
If the party knew what was good for them.
This is Douglas Stamper. He's coming on as a consultant.
We've met.
Jonah, back when Francis was whip,
and you, back when you were getting us coffee.
I do wonder how he'd feel with some
of the legislation the good congressman is putting hisname on.
Constitution was built on checks and balances.
And the people's will.
It's not about who the President is.
It's about what the office has become.
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me for a minute,
I promised Brett here I'd introduce him to a blue dog Democrat,
assuming I can find one.
I never thought I'd see him again.
He was in rehab.
And is back in the program.
Those charges were dropped,
but he's still got a case chasing him.
If anything, my bet is that case is chasing the President.
Petrov is no longer in the main room.
Secretary Siegerson is still with Ms. Davis,
while the vice president's exiting.
And Homeland Secretary Cafferty
was just whispering with the President.
As for Doug Stamper, he's with Assistant Director Green.
I want to know who Durant was with,
when and where, leading up to the moment she was pronounced dead.
If I start asking around...
Questions bring more questions.
  Is this an open investigation?   No.
But for any agent I work with, I'll be the red flag.
Doug, the more I know, the better it is for both of us.
You trust me?
You've always followed through.
Then do as I say.
But what did you find?
Is he talking?
All right. Get back to me when you know anything more.
Day or night.
Is everything okay?
That was about Tom Yates.
There's been a recent charge on his credit card.
The Grand Mark in Prague,
except it wasn't Tom.
He didn't make the charge. Or any of the others.
  Somebody stole his...   His identity.
As of now, we have no idea where the real Tom Yates has been.
Well, I hope he's safe.
Wherever he is.
Me too.
"V" Label.
Rothschild commissioned it to celebrate the Allied victory
in the Great Patriotic War.
You mean World War II.
I wonder what she was saving this for.
Should we?
Come on. There must be some mischief in you somewhere.
Do you object?
Not my place.
And where exactly is your place?
I specifically asked to meet with the President.
There must be a corkscrew somewhere, hmm?
She wouldn't keep these bottles in here without one.
  When it comes to Syria, Mr. President...   A moment, please.
Sir...
our only goal is stability,
peace, prosperity for the Syrian people.
We need to re-engage. We need to re-start talks...
Talks?
Talk, talk, talk.
While you're busy making side deals with Nexis
and the rest of your Republican friends.
The Shepherds.
That is who you really work for, isn't it?
We can freeze assets,
put sanctions back into place.
Must be about...
If we do nothing,
by dawn, skirmishes between our troops and yours will begin.
And once Russian soldiers start killing American soldiers,
the chaos will continue.
Or...
we can pull out a map of Syria, right here, right now.
And you and I, like the imperialists we are,
can decide who gets what.
Shall we?
I'll speak to the President.
Whoever decides...
is who you should speak to.
What a shame.
What a shame.
I talked to Doug. He asked me,
and at first I thought he was just covering his tracks,
as far as the Secretary's death, but...
Now I wonder...
the nature of his questions.
Ma'am, I've made some calls.
There are some inconsistencies.
When she left her house. Where she died.
  Wait, what are you telling me?   I'm not saying it isn't true...
Just a second, back up.
It's just hard to be certain is all I'm saying.
  I'd like you to go find him.   I can't talk to him again.
My fear is he'll become suspicious.
He knows me as someone who does what he's told.
I don't understand, If it's not him, then...
how did she die, for God's sake?
Ma'am...
I don't know.
Mr. Shepherd would like to be kept informed in real time.
It's under control.
Then it shouldn't be a problem to keep us included.
Do you understand how long I've known the Shepherds?
Whatever you discussed with Petrov needs to be run by him.
Let me enlighten you about something, Mr. Grayson.
I do not need you to convey
a message between me and Bill Shepherd, okay?
Well, that's preferable, as long as, and forgive me,
you make no decisions when it comes to Syria without his say-so.
  Don't get over your skis, sir.   We're done here.
  I don't think...   The vice president says we are done.
Doug Stamper.
Linda. How are you?
  You weren't at the funeral.   I arrived late.
Out of politics, I understand?
President Walker made sure I had a soft landing.
I'm at a university in Colorado,
where the water is fresh and the air is clean.
  Sounds dangerous.   It is.
To think that clearly.
How are you?
What have you read?
About you?
Most of it.
The last three months of it.
About your supposed confession.
What more could I possibly add that you haven't already read?
There's what you read, and there's the truth.
I'm not ashamed.
The time away led me to finally realize who I am.
Does the congressman know about you?
I mean... know.
With my help he's gonna be the next speaker of the House...
I went to law school with the US Attorney.
She's tired of waiting.
She's issuing a subpoena with your name on it sometime tomorrow.
Tell her what you know.
You have a chance to survive all this, Doug.
Tartus, da?
But the rest of the coast...
can we afford to let it go?
Goodbye.
It could work.
Petrov has plans to expand the Naval base
to the port of Tartus.
The only reason he's propping up the regime
is because they control the coast.
He needs the ports.
Force him to fight for those
and he'll leave the rest of Syria alone.
Mark...
the moment is here.
He's here.
It can't wait.
I still don't understand how
agreements which haven't even been finalized yet...
  Doesn't matter. He got wind of it.   From who?
The point is, is he is a greedy...
Motherfucker, yes.
And greedy motherfuckers always find out.
He's relentless.
I spent two years in the Kurdish northwest,
outfitted rebels in the southeast.
I know every angle Petrov will keep in play.
He has a sixth sense when it comes to hesitation.
If you need me to be in there...
You just can't do it, can you?
  What?   Nothing.
  Mark...   You just can't step back and trust.
I trust you, Mark.
But if the backseat president
is gonna take the wheel, you gotta drive.
There's a reason you and I are alone in the world, Jane.
Yes, of course.
  How long?   A lifetime.
You moved out west, right? More time with your son.
As much as he'll give me.
  And is he still enjoying Stan...   Claire.
Madam President,
we don't need to exchange pleasantries.
These days I tend to think a lot about what might have been.
I'd like to apologize.
  For what?   My one regret.
I should've been there in Gaffney.
Honestly,
it's been haunting me.
There was something he needed to know.
It was a mistake.
Overlooking Francis for secretary of state.
  Linda, it's water under the bridge.   No.
No.
If we hadn't,
I don't know.
Maybe everything would have been different.
For who?
This country.
Obviously, there's no way for me to tell him that now.
The least I can do is tell you.
There is no need for that.
How do you expect to separate yourself from his crimes?
As corrupt as these politics we put up with have become...
how can the people against you not use it?
You thought you got away with it all, Claire.
But that remains to be seen.
Everything happens exactly as it should.
Nice seeing you.
What are you up to?
I'm thinking about mortality.
I think a lot of us are doing that today.
We're about to have a meeting.
I can't be a part of it. Viktor knows me all too well.
I'm on board.
Claire, I see you. I told Mark not to worry about it.
But I have an inkling that's not necessarily...
Spare me your inkling, Jane.
This deal is for your own good.
It's about the whole region.
Our presence. Our authority.
Mark and Marcy can do the heavy lifting.
Help me prevent a war from happening today.
Any more instability and everybody loses.
Help me avert that.
I promise you...
I will chip away at Bill and Annette Shepherd.
Because the only way to truly take them down
is one piece at a time.
What do you think really happened to Cathy?
Okay.
I guess you got lucky then.
No one is that lucky.
the President is willing to leave the coast uncontested.
  Tartus...   That port is already ours.
And will remain so.
We'll keep our forces away from the entire Western coast.
This will give you unfettered access to the Mediterranean.
  No.   Sir, the Sixth Fleet is en route.
  No.   If you want a naval standoff...
No! Let's not pretend.
What's really at stake here is your country lining its pockets and...
Madam President,
Mr. President,
  the vice president asked me to join.   Mr. Grayson...
On behalf of a company
  with subsidiaries in the Middle East.   Excuse me.
We want to ensure that we're part of the solution.
This will signal to the world that Russia is back.
  Russia's back?   Mr. Vice President,
there are terms being negotiated here that need to be discussed...
Christ!
If Secretary Durant were here,
we'd be long past this posturing
  and dealing with the real question.   Yes, peace in the region.
Peace? Really?
You want to use peace to decide
who will rebuild this pizdets?
I don't understand what that means,
  Mr. President.   That means clusterfuck.
Sir, stability in the region helps all of us.
You want to give me the West and take the East?
That's a first.
So, here's what I want.
The ports, yes, of course.
But I also want Russian
exclusivity on all offshore oil and gas exploration.
  I think we need to wait.   Shut up.
We can't be in a position where we can get in,
and we can't get our resources out.
If history has taught us anything, it's that
the Americans always find a way to leave,
no matter what it costs them.
So...
thoughts, Madam President?
Anything?
I concur with the vice president.
I believe we have much to consider.
Playing incompetent is so exhausting.
Here's a copy of the President's remarks
for the secretary's memorial this evening.
I already have a copy.
It includes the changes she made in the car.
Right. Thank you.
Is it true Tom Yates is missing?
I believe so.
Is it true he had an affair with somebody in the White House?
Was it you?
Excuse me.
I'll look through this.
Thank you.
  I don't like liars.   Me neither.
Why would you let me believe...
It seemed like you wanted me to be the one responsible for Cathy.
That it might be useful to you somehow.
Every time I plan to quit, something happens.
Francis would certainly be disappointed in me.
Terrible habit.
Helped me though when I quit drinking.
Don't say anything to the US attorney, Doug.
She's working with the Shepherds.
I pardon you tonight,
and anything else she has will be my problem.
I'll always be a problem for you.
What do you want from me, Doug?
You're the one with all the leverage here.
Congressman Cole. I'll put himon my ticket .
Mark won't survive, I'm sure of it.
And you will be back in the White House.
We can make him president,
just like we did with Francis.
Cole will mean a split ticket.
And that might be the very best thing for this country.
Pardon Francis as well.
If I do that, I could get impeached.
No.
You're a survivor. You've proven that much.
Pardon him as well.
Bill's gonna hate anything
even approaching a partnership with the Kremlin.
It's his sister who holds a grudge.
But still, you have no choice.
I mean, in my experience, once the chaos tips into forever,
you've got nothing.
And we're very close to forever.
And she said nothing.
It really bothers you, doesn't it?
When you can't figure a person out.
  Especially when you're attracted.   Oh, my God, what are you...
I am not involved with Claire Underwood.
I'm talking about Annette.
I'm not involved with anyone at the moment.
Every time I see the both of you together, it brings back memories.
Never thought you'd step out from behind the scenes.
Well, wherever I can do the most good, Congressman.
He hasn't changed. Not at all.
Blessing and a curse.
I haven't forgotten everything you did for me.
Oh, you made it to the House with or without me.
You showed me the way.
Well...
I've been meaning to say hello,
ever since you left the party and went to the other side.
Jane.
Haven't spoken to him in over a decade.
He knows.
He knows I was involved.
Well, weren't you?
Weren't we?
When's the last time you were in my house?
Don't.
Mark, I'm not going back there.
No, no,
Tom Yates was sleeping with the new press secretary
in the White House.
He traded the East for the West.
Yes, all offshore oil and gas exploration, sir.
They're saying we'll still have access,
but all shipping through the Mediterranean will be affected.
And there's no denying we'll be somewhat at their mercy.
Because there wasn't time to consult you.
Petrov upped the ante
and it looks like the vice president is going to cave.
It's not a complicated question, Miss Stewart.
Were you sleeping with him?
Do I need to say
this administration has taken a huge chance on you?
  Were you sleeping...   It is none of your business.
That answers that, then.
This is exactly the kind of thing the White House needs...
to avoid.
And Tom Yates is missing.
Which only makes the whole story more problematic.
I have no idea where any of this is coming from.
Well, I suggest you find a more convincing way of denying it.
Because your inability to lie is a liability, right?
Now, where is our president?
Why didn't you tell them I invited you?
You didn't rat me out.
You sound like a gangster, Madam President.
Curiosity, I suppose.
I wanted to watch you
and hear them.
Your vice president is serving too many masters.
Strange, hmm?
Cathy passing away so soon after Francis.
Death usually comes in threes.
Except when it comes in fours or fives.
Are you free now, Madam President?
Not quite.
Were you happy with what they proposed?
Mostly, I'm just curious.
About what?
What you're about to offer. That is why you invited me.
And that is why I said yes.
Well, Nexis Securities
or any other contractor connected to Shepherd Unlimited
will never be allowed in Syria while I'm president.
That's a strong declaration.
Bids will be contingent on my approval.
You can have the oil and gas, the ports.
And   of profits from the resources passing through.
That's...
That's quite a taste.
Maybe you are a gangster.
And how will you...
defend your position?
Peace.
Isn't that what our two countries
have used to justify what we've done
in the region for over a hundred years?
Peace is overrated, Claire.
So are my vice president's promises.
And yet, yours seem too generous.
Your husband would have lost himself
in the brightness of this day,
blinded by how he needed to be seen.
That always cost him.
Can I ask?
If you knew this...
why did you marry him?
Do you even know?
As it turns out...
my husband was a means to an end.
Tell the people you work for that I'm not going to testify.
A second.
Seth.
Seth, do you hear me?
Back off, Doug.
Whatever you told them, I'll have no part of it.
The U.S. Attorney can subpoena me. She can try to...
I'm done.
You wouldn't know a good thing if it smacked you in the face.
I don't know why I'm trying to help you.
You're not in the White House anymore, Doug.
Where were you?
Even presidents need to pee, Mark.
Look, there's a rumor flying around.
  Was it good?   It's easily dismissible.
Then I talked to NSA. It's not gonna work, Claire.
Some White House affair is not gonna make it go away.
The dead never really stay dead, Mark.
Not for the people who loved them.
  Excuse me.   Excuse me.
Did you get taller?
Yes.
So strange
for someone trapped in a Napoleon complex.
If only your personality matched your looks, Jane Davis.
I was surprised you left negotiations
to your surrogate Ms. Siegerson.
Always best to speak for oneself.
That's rich, coming from you.
Doublespeak is your mother tongue.
And subterfuge is yours.
You and your agencies, hmm?
The CIA is nothing short of a cultural terrorist.
It's men like you...
Barging into countries you know nothing about.
  You get under my skin.   Profiting from destabilization.
Leaving nothing but ruin in your wake.
  It's chemical, it's...   And then you're offended...
You're offended when it's my men, my air strikes,
  that bring some kind of order.   Chemical!
You are nothing but a communist in a handmade suit.
A pig!
So emotional.
Emotions make deals come apart, Jane.
Tell me,
why should I trust any deal that involves you?
I will not rest
until you're done, Viktor.
Dead and buried.
  Bastard!   Then I guess...
you'll never rest.
Okay. My directions were clear.
  No doubt.   So where's the confusion?
Well, I'm guessing somewhere between what you wanted to happen
and what had to happen.
If you didn't want me to call Bill,
you shouldn't have given me a reason to.
There was no place for you in that room.
And unless you show some proper respect,
no place for you in this whole fucking town.
I'll see to that personally.
I'll keep that in mind.
From now on,stay in your lane, keep your mouth shut,
unless I say otherwise. You got it?
Again, coming in clear,
but not a dent.
It's okay, we'll get there.
Even if we don't, fuck do I care?
I don't work for you.
We both work for him.
Mr. Stamper.
We usually meet under more orchestrated circumstances.
Not that this isn't one of those, as well.
Where do you find yourself these days?
Consulting for an ambitious Congressman.
Midterms are coming.
I bet...
he has no idea how well you see in the dark.
Who do you fear most?
Out of all of them.
Her.
I can't eat at these things, either.
The spread looks lovely. Everything.
You all did right by her.
Well, I didn't do a thing.
Stan took care of all of it.
How you holding up?
I can't make sense of it.
My dad went the same way, you know?
Never sick a day in his life. And then...
Right when he was driving,
  just drifted onto oncoming traffic.   Jesus.
  Oh, my goodness.   I had to quickly grab the wheel
and swerved us over to the shoulder.
How old were you?
Twelve.
Twelve. That's rough.
It's all rough.
Twelve. Twenty-one.
Fifty-one.
You're never ready.
Wednesday afternoon she calls me, as she does.
Said her head hurt.
Like migraine bad, so she...
was headed to her personal doctor.
I call back to see how she was doing.
Stan hits me with it.
She didn't even make it to the office. It happened in the car.
So, I got on the first flight out.
Hey, it's okay.
Doug's right.
It's fine, let it out.
By the time I landed, it was all done.
Body was...
whatever, at the place...
to get cremated.
No autopsy, nothing.
Stan made it happen so fast.
And I'm the only one who can't keep shit together.
But it's just...
I never got the chance to see her.
To say goodbye.
I'm sorry. You all didn't ask for any of this.
  No. Please.   We get it.
Yes, Doug Stamper and the President seem very much in sync.
I was hoping to attend the secretary's memorial as well,
but my time is limited.
It was meaningful that you traveled all this way.
I've been thinking about what you said to me.
I accept.
I'm so happy to hear that.
One other thing. Tom Yates.
Your government was behind whatever happened to him.
Presidents aren't allowed to be human.
You have to choose. Power or love.
That was very clear from the beginning.
Forgive me, Tom Yates.
I'm about to drag you through the mud
to deny we ever happened.
I'm killing you for the second time.
One day, you'll rest in peace.
Madam President.
Ma'am, I have to tell you
  there are rumors circulating...   I know, I know.
If you need me to resign...
Kelsey, you're not going anywhere.
You can stay at my place as long as you like.
I appreciate it.
Two weeks in Bellport
tapped me out.
Well, your paper will cover some of that.
They don't do expenses, Tom.
And my mom didn't have much to leave.
I liked the piece.
It was strong.
What's your follow-up?
Well, it's not like anybody at the EPAcan confirm.
Well, if the emails exist, they went to somebody.
Yeah, but my only source won't return my calls.
He's gotta show up to work every day.
He's afraid. He should be.
Follow up with the app.
Grayson was there, signing up people who were very scared.
They took advantage of a crisis.
  The Shepherds.   It's unethical, but it's not illegal.
Oh, shit.
They shut down Pennsylvania Avenue.
It says to take Massachusetts.
All right.
It's Cathy Durant's memorial today.
The bodies are adding up.
Tom, from the very beginning, we did what we thought was right.
At the time, anyway.
Is that how we ended up in this car together?
Look, you cannot blame yourself for...
For not doing enough. Why not?
Why shouldn't I?
Rachel Posner?
Somebody with her name
is bouncing checks in and around New Mexico.
Yeah. And if it leads to nowhere?
Will you ever be able to...
leave it?
If the truth starts to fade away?
Truthfully...
I don't know.
I just heard from Bugayev.  ?
I haven't told Mark and the rest yet.
Just know you'll be crucified.
Yes, and how will I feel the difference?
You shouldn't have excluded me.
What's going on with you and Claire?
Look, I can only assume while you were away
somebody broke down the definition of insanity.
If not, here's a refresher.
Doing the same shit over and over
and expecting different results.
Yeah, I don't know what she told you
to induce such amnesia,
but if you're seriously looking down that road again,
there is something that you should know about Francis' will.
Has she told you what's in it?
Who told you?
If I were you, that's not the question I'd be asking right now.
I'd be asking, "Why is she keeping me from the truth?"
He left you more than those cuff links.
You're welcome, Doug.
President Underwood,
Brett Cole.
Yes, I know who you are.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Madam President, you should make your way to the stage.
Yes, of course. Thank you.
Doug.
  Speak soon?   Yes, ma'am.
Anything you need to tell me now?
Nope, nothing.
That story about your father, is that true?
Does it matter?
Well, if it's true, it explains a lot.
If it's not, it explains a lot.
  Thank you for coming.   Sorry.
I appreciate it.
So sorry.
Good to see you.
To weather the slings and arrows of  years of service
and not lose a fraction of one's signature grit and integrity,
that's not a legacy,
that's a miracle.
But Catherine Durant wasn't just a Secretary of State.
She was a sister.
Why isn't someone on the house right now?
Well, then you heard wrong.
That's right. Day and night.
Yes, every second
until he is on the C to Switzerland.
No, no, no. No ETAs.
Hard dates and times.
Correct.
No.
I'll be the one to intercept him in Annecy.
Yes, of course.
As soon as the money is wired, you'll be taken care of.House.of.Cards.SE
What time did she die?
I don't...
Sorry, I know it's a weird question.
If it's not him, then...
how did she die, for God's sake?
What do you think really happened to Cathy?
I guess you got lucky then.
No one is that lucky.
The talks on Syria have broken down, what's he doing here?
If we do nothing,
the chaos will continue.
So, here's what I want.
Russian exclusivity on all offshore oil and gas exploration.
And she said nothing.
Why didn't you tell them I invited you?
Bids will be contingent on my approval.
You can have the oil and gas, the ports.
And   of profits from the resources passing through.
I accept.
Rachel Posner?
Somebody with her name
is bouncing checks in and around New Mexico.
What's going on with you and Claire?
Congressman Cole. I'll put him on my ticket .
Pardon Francis as well.
There is something that you should know about Francis' will.
He left you more than those cuff links.
  Good day, Calonice.   Claire, what are you doing?
Thinking.
You're supposed to be on-stage right now.
"Calonice, it's more than I can bear.
I am hot all over with blushes for our sex.
Men say we're slippery rogues..."
"And aren't they right?"
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
We're all gonna die one day.
What?
I'm gonna be dead,
you're gonna be dead.
They're all gonna be dead.
Everybody.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Are those my earrings?
I... didn't think you'd care.
You do it.
You be Lysistrata. You know all my lines, right?
You can't just  
What about the show? Claire!
We are almost good. We just have to adjust the lights.
That's fine.
I did want to thank you personally for doing this.
I really appreciate it.
Wait till we're finished before you do that.
Well, I won't deviate from the questions.
You can ask me anything, as long as it's about the...
the president.
  Can you get away from me with that?   My apologies.
  I'm fine.   Sorry, Mr. Shepherd.
It's just that the lights are pretty harsh.
It's fine. Let's go.
This Russia debacle,
it's essentially a   tax
on American companies that are just over there
trying to help out the region.
It's the latest in a series of...
disastrous steps taken by this White House.
And you wonder  
You wonder why Congress was looking at legislation
to take the nuclear button away from her.
As a patriot,
as an American who loves his country and, yes, his company,
we can do better.
We can do so much better.
Even Bill Shepherd,
who the last time he was interviewed on air was never  
Even he felt compelledto speak out.
She's the head of my party, and I have to say, I'm at a loss.
Her entire schedule is empty.
Presidents have gone missing before  
But there's a difference between clearing your head at Camp David
and going full-blown Howard Hughes.
She hasn't been seenpublicly in three weeks or heard from.
Except for a late night pardon for her husband's chief of staff.
Which many consider a strategic mistake.
Well, Doug Stamper has issues.
Everyone in her administration has issues.
Sean Jeffries, the press secretary, has resigned.
And there are probably more departures to come.
Her cabinet has had enough.
And if she thinks a pardon is gonna keep the US Attorney away,
  she's     She's  
  Depressed.   I don't know about depressed.
You know, she looks either very disturbed, or depressed.
But, I mean, "disturbed"? Can you really say that?
Yeah. Look, hold on.
I'm asking a very real question about her ability to lead here.
Have you seen this photo? Because we have.
Now we're not here to diagnose,
but you look at this, and you need to ask.
On behalf of our country,
that woman undid  years of foreign policy
by acting like, pardon my French, a...
But now, now we're into a new phase.
When the White House lights are on, but nobody's home.
I mean, she's home, but she won't leave.
Been hunkered down in there for  days and counting.
Apparently, she's stopped doing anything.
She's paralyzed.
A paralyzed...
And there's nothing more dangerous than aparalyzed...
Seriously, I think she might be the worst thing
that has ever happened to this country.
SOS.
Save our souls, save our ships,
Take your pick.
This ... is real.
I'm Melody Cruz, and that's what I got.
That's quite a snapshot, right?
Unique. Carefully calibrated.
Pain, hysteria and just a small dose of crazy.
Claire Underwood, like they've never seen before.
It's actually not as easy as it looks.
See, in order for me to make that face,
I have to imagine...
the perfect combination of things.
Here's the recipe.
First, I have to think about all the ways
in which men have tried to manage me my whole life.
Then, I think of...
America's worst fear...
when it comes to a female in the Oval Office.
  Her schedule has been cleared.   And finally...
...my biggest regret   Francis J. Underwood.
Madam President.
Are you ill?
If you're ill, I'll call the White House physician.
Claire.
Just get out, Mark.
Claire, this has to stop.
Please, just leave me alone.
You are alarming the nation. You need to get up.
Listen.
I've prepared a short statement
explaining your absence and announcing your return.
You can deliver it in the Rose Garden this afternoon.
I promise you this is for both of our sakes.
You don't understand...
If you would, please.
Claire...
look at me.
  Look at me.   Get out.
Please get out.
  Just leave me alone.   You are not only digging your own grave,
you are burying the presidency. Stop it.
You can try.
  Can you try?   I can't, Mark.
I just can't.
I can't.
Don't worry.
I have a plan.
Excuse me.
Sir.
We're good here?
Yeah. Thank you.
Was it paranoia or is it due diligence?
You tell me, Mark.
We both just lived through what that bitch is capable of.
Something is definitely wrong.
She...
Coffee?
I mean, she can't even put two sentences together.
Are you sure?
I've never seen her like this. She's a mess.
Well...
Either way, that doesn't change where we are.
And, Mark...
when Conway imploded,
we recognized that you were a little squea  
squeamish about stepping in.
And we appreciate that.
But it's time.
You'll make a great president.
We'll see to that.
Now, wait, wait. Let's be clear, okay?
I know we've been hitting herpretty hard,
but I can't condone another attempt.
  I can't.   Calm down.
My God, Mark. I mean, really.
There are other ways.
Okay, so we're talking about impeachment
or a congressional government?
Which has never been used.
It's built for speed, intended to smother a crisis of confidence.
Reassure the public.
Reassure the world
that continuity remains at the American government,
even if a president becomes...
  Unable to fulfill his duties.   Her duties.
  It requires her to be unfit.   And she is.
I mean...
our lawyers have already looked into this.
She only needs to be deficient.
The language is vague and accommodating.
Mark, if you have any doubt about this
  at all     I'm just listening.
The Cabinet is yours.
You have relationships inside the Senate, the House,
on both sides of the aisle.
It's a natural fit.
But the thing has to cascade with  
Precision.
A chain reaction beginning with a letter to Congress,
signed by the vice president
and a majority of his Cabinet,
recommending my removal from office.
And how do I know that's what they'll try to do?
Because the th gets personal.
Bill likes me being the damsel in distress.
He wishes I were.
Where you headed?
I have family up north.
Where?
North.
Cathy's sister still on the Cape?
Hyannis, right?
It's good.
Family's important.
Especially during trying times  
I'd invite you in, but I really  
There's still something that I can't get straight.
If we could go through it one more time. So...
She was picked up by car to be taken to the doctor.
She wasn't feeling well.
You were with her the whole time leading up to the embolism?
Mr. Stamper, enough!
I'm just trying to understand what happened.
I don't need you coming around here anymore.
You know exactly what happened.
You have the coroner's conclusions. And that's that.
I'm in mourning for my wife,
and I'm not reliving the final moments of her life anymore.
Not with you.
I think your wife was murdered.
I'm closing the door now.
  Hello.   Doug. Fred Amburg here.
  Whose phone is this?   This one's mine.
I just got out.
I had no idea.
I talked to Cole this morning.
Heard an interesting thing about our esteemed shrink.
You know, that sabbatical, leave,
walkabout, whatever you want to call it.
You are looking for him, aren't you?
Yes.
He's in a cabin down in Virginia.
Here you go.
Would you mind if I...?
Thanks.
Oh, hello?
Don't say another word. Don't speak. Just wait.
My apologies, I took a wrong turn and wound up in some stairwell.
We don't have much time until we have to get back upstairs.
When Marcy first came to me with this proposition,
I was stunned, to say the least.
Until recently I  
I don't know. I didn't realize how truly bad things were.
But unseat the president? Jesus Christ.
President's my friend.
And while I worry about her mental state,
I worry about the state of this nation more.
Mr. Vice President, I admire you greatly.
But I'm not used to this kind of thing.
Back rooms, after hours.
We need to take every precaution.
And yet we're still at risk just by being here.
I'm sorry,
but I believe in the sanctity of the office of the presidency.
And that's exactly why we're here.
You're asking us to betray an oath.
I'm asking you to speak your mind.
A concentrated effort, all of us in this room.
We may not be able to save the president,
but we may just be able to save our administration.
The th is not just about timing.
It's about secrecy.
And the Senate hasn't kept a secret  
Earl, I appreciate that.
I have the House, and I'll take care of the Senate.
I'll prepare a letter
detailing the president's dereliction of duty,
laying out a case for Congress and for posterity.
And when the time comes, you'll all be notified.
Look, we're all patriots here.
Our first concern, our only concern, has got to be...
the survival of our nation.
Fuck!
Sit and take a deep breath.
Sit down.
Dr. Rosen, sit down.
How did you get in here?
I'm assuming you're here because you're suffering.
And if it's not over Zoe Barnes,
it's over some other soul that you've torn apart.
No.
You're assuming I'm here
because I figured out what you took from me.
  Took?   Kept.
All personal property should have been returned upon release.
You're right. It should have.
There's no accounting for the behavior of supposed professionals.
I once met this psychologist, socially,
who told me about
a party that she hosted once for a group of her peers.
It was just a roomful of shrinks.
At the end of the night, she was cleaning up,
she went into the bathroom
and she saw that one of her colleagues had smeared shit
all over the bathroom wall.
Now, what kind of fucked up person would do something like that?
Well, I guess it's true what they say.
That shrinks are the most fucked up of all.
Such a violence to that act.
But violence is a funny thing.
You know, it's not so much the physical pain
that can victims can remember.
It's the feelings around it.
The fear.
Where is it? The will you intercepted? Where is it?
I don't have it anymore.
I don't have it!
What was in it?
He left you everything.
God...
Take it.
Thank you.
I thought it was a strange question.
What?
When you asked me what Francis Underwood had given me.
That's how the will ends.
"Remember the last thing I gave you."
Don't call her or I'll be back.
Hope you figure out your problems, Doctor.
Take it.
If you want it, it's yours.
Do you ever wonder if you're living somebody else's life?
Whose life are you living, Jane?
Not me. You.
You seem to be struggling with your identity.
If that's not too impertinent to say to a...
sitting president.
Come keep me company while I put my jammies on.
Please.
Your little show of compliance at the funeral
as you made your side dealwith Victor.
Makes me wonder.
And now what?
What do you call this show?
How to turn  million people against you in three short weeks?
Congratulations, Claire.
You've become a problem for everybody.
And...
Just so you know,
Syria may be too far gone.
Tell me what to do, Jane.
I was at an event tonight.
An event the president usually attends.
And how was that evening?
The storm that's gathering is a rough one.
When you think they'll strike?
I have no idea.
It's late.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
I think I should move out.
I understand.
Stick to this course, Madam President,
and...
Full house.
You must be looking for different answers
to the same questions we've been going over for the last  
Now,  days.
And the president still hasn't left the residence.
  And this is where I say     Kelsey, come on.
For now, the ground-breaking accord with Russia,
which aims for a just and lasting peace in Syria,
speaks for itself.
So,
unless there are any more questions,
or shall I say new questions? Yes.
Isn't the vice president really the one running the show,
essentially acting as president?
There are members of the cabinet who are saying as much.
Well, firstly, I would refrain from using the word "show,"
when it comes to the White House.
And   yeah. That's all for today.
Thank you.
Are you sure you're not hungry?
The soup is quite nice.
I don't know how you can  
Eat?
No, I'm...
glad to see you're eating.
Madam President, it's beyond repair.
You understand that, at this point?
You've lost the Hill.
You've lost your cabinet.
You've lost the country.
You've lost.
Your own party can't even find a reason to support you.
I entreat you  
You entreat me?
Resign.
And are you speaking to me as vice president?
I'm speaking to you as a person.
Blame it on...
the strain after Francis' death, the strain of the office itself.
Language can be found, but the best you can hope for now...
is a dignified exit.
What's so moving about him is he can't help himself.
He can't help being decent. Human.
His glorious flaw.
What this means is
they're gonna go through with it.
No, Mark.
I'm staying right where I am.
You got two minutes.
That's not Rachel Posner.
Is it?
You knew Rachel Posner.
I mean...
yeah, I guess.
Enough to use her name for someone else's ID?
That's what you do, isn't it?
Kind of pay the names forward?
No.
What name did you give Rachel?
I don't remember.
I don't.
When did you last see her?
Come on.
Couple of years ago or something.
It was where she worked.
Is she dead?
  I got nothing to do with that.   Did you help kill her?
I'm talking to you.
Man. I want my lawyer.
Do you know...
Doug Stamper?
No.
What name did you give her?
What was her name?
Lisa.
  Lisa?   Yeah. Lisa Cassie.
  Lisa Cassie?   Cassie, Lisa.
  Yeah.   Lisa and Cassie?
Back at the White House.
You took his room.
It's bigger.
Can you tell me why
it was so important that we meet here and now?
Honestly, I was hoping we could meet in the West Wing.
I haven't left the residence in...
Well, I'm sure you still read the news.
And your pardon...
hasn't helped me or Francis.
I don't feel comfortable here.
Whatever bad memories you may have, Doug...
sometimes it takes a long time to understand
who's the real source of our harm.
And I have failed to make you trust me,
and that's a shame.
I trust what I know.
You have enemies, and they underestimate you.
And how do you think they'll come at me?
Has Congressman Cole said anything to you?
I think she's alive.
Cathy Durant.
I don't know where she is or what she's up to, but...
I knew you'd want to know.
I want you to know something.
Francis died in this room.
I told everyone it was in my bed.
But it was right there on the floor.
Whoever killed him.
Am I missing something?
Whoever killed him
will get what she or he deserves.
Timing decided the shape of the universe.
Who said that?
Me.
Hell is truth seen too late.
Did you say that?
Thomas Hobbes.
Usher...
your bet.
  I'll check, please.   Don't be polite.
I played with you before.
I know you're holding.
Bill, you sure?
I can deal you in on the next hand.
  I don't play.   Is it true she's a basket case?
Or just a plain old Democrat.
So, I'll have the letter.
That's a hundred to see mine.
And when it comes time, Hank,
I don't want to end up
on the Senate floor with a piece of paper in one hand  
And your balls in the other?
We've all been there.
Just keep my balls out of it.
Usher, you want me to whip,
but you don't want me to tell my senators what they're voting on.
And pass without debate.
I'm out.
At least tell me what they're getting.
A new resident in the White House.
Well, Mr. President.
Are you in or are you out?
I call.
And...
bump you .
I would never call this enemy territory.
It might sound quaint,
but I believe in the Republic.
Well, thank you for coming.
It's not sustainable.
This media onslaught.
I wonder if you'd consider calling off the dogs.
All I'm asking for is a pause. Couple of days or so.
You flatter me, Madam President.
But my reach only goes so far.
It seems they want you to resign.
Who's they?
Who isn't?
Pardon my bluntness.
Oh, no, I enjoy bluntness. Saves time.
But should I resign for the high crime of being a female?
Oh, I think the reasoning goes deeper than that.
I think...
and this is just my perspective,
  if you want to hear it.   Oh, please.
Dueling agendas between my family,
and, well, you, have taken on their own life.
And in some sense, your husband just won't leave you alone,
will he?
I can't change history.
I'll bet sometimes you'd like to.
Wouldn't you like to erase him?
Madam President...
your dead husband told my mother things.
Things you don't want the world to know.
A dead man's words are worthless as far as I'm concerned.
Not when his claims can be verified.
It's possible to make the memory of a person disappear.
Digitally.
Move them far into the background, anyways.
There are ways.
Algorithms.
You're a very confident young man.
Even your deeds can go away.
Now, I can make it easier for all of us to work together.
Does your mother know you're here?
No.
Just out of curiosity, what's your first memory?
Your first memory of her?
That's a strange question.
I was just curious.
I have a photograph of her catching me.
My mother had thrown me up into the air,
and my uncle snapped a picture on his new Nikon camera.
She's beaming.
Gleeful.
I treasure that photo.
It's how I like to think of her.
Do me a favor.
Ask Annette  
Ask your mother where you came from.
It's still light out?
You're very dehydrating.
I know, I know.
You want to talk about the deal.
You excluded me, Jane.
When the dust settles, I'll give you what you want.
Never doubted your value.
Have you seen my phone?
It's in the restroom.
Shit.
Did you do something to my  
I went to the EPA.
There is nothing.
Jesus Christ.
There are people walking around this town,
dressed down, acting like they belong.
But I know they don't.
Have you been threatened?
Come on, they're too smart for that.
Well, so they're following you.
But if there's nothing,
  then there's     I have screenshots...
of the e-mail chain.
'Cause it's wrong what they did.
'Cause I'm so stupid.
So stupid to believe in doingthe right thing
in this totally fucked up world.
There's an e-mail from Bill Shepherd's office in the chain.
I told you. They knew.
They knew somebody was gonna die.
I gotta go.
Wait.
What?
Your phone.
  What about it?   I don't trust it.
I got rid of mine.
I swear, it felt like they were following my phone
and not me.
  How?   Look, I gotta go.
I'll reach out to you.
  Okay?   No. What  
She's somewhere in Saudi Arabia.
Ma'am, she poses a significant risk in enemy hands.
You know that.
The United States does not negotiate with terrorists.
No negotiations. Options are being drawn up at SOCOM.
But nothing can happen without an executive order.
Well, then.
That's gonna have to happen when you're president.
No one's secrets are safe with Jane in captivity.
That may be more concerning for you than it is for me.
Kicking the hornet's nest. Time to move this thing along.
  You arrogant little prick.   Please, just calm down.
Did you think I wouldn't find out?
I'm not staying if there's name-calling.
There's not enough names to call him, Annie.
Such stunning stupidity.
Nice alliteration, Uncle Bill.
This towel is smarter than you.
This window is smarter than you.
This rug is smarter than you.
  Hello, Seth.   Hello, sir.
Seth is smarter than you!
The sweat on my brow
  is smarter than you, Duncan.   Jesus H. Christ,
  spare us.   Because sweat on my brow,
would have at least known not to pay an unsanctioned visit
  to the President of the United States.   Get your hands off him.
I know you're not feeling well, but...
Well, what the hell is that supposed to mean, anyway?
You can't act like this.
You know, I was trying to help. She invited me and  
And you went, like a fucking idiot  
I wanted to be a bridge.
Shut up, both of you, just shut up.
God, is there anything we haven't done for you?
Well, you know, that's what people do for family.
  Anything.   Listen, you shouldn't have gone.
She can't be trusted, as I've told you a million times.
He jeopardized our timing.
He jeopardized our timing with her!
I can't stand the sound of male arguing anymore.
You know, she told me to ask you something.
She told me to ask you where I came from.
Seth. Seth!
Sixteen weeks.
The one from the pregnancy with her husband.
Annie, I do think it'd be a mistake.
Seth, confirm it.
  That's right. Sixteen weeks.   Her husband told me.
But you don't know how it's gonna play. Okay?
It could backfire. Get her sympathy.
  Who waits  weeks?   The narrative can't be controlled  
What kind of person, that's what people will be talking about.
Let's get Mark on the phone. We start this now.
Only "Lisa" is what we called her.
The lady at Central Market, where she worked,
said you stopped by a few times asking for her.
She owed us some money, but...
She dead?
I don't know.
There's not much in there.
Some letters.
Scraps and lists and...
Picture.
Nothing, really.
Our country has a problem right now.
The president,
she has ignored the advice of her senior advisers,
people who have studied and fought battles.
Her state of mind has left us in a weakened...
We need to hold the line
till our country gets back on course.
That is a truly stunning video.
What is your reaction to the secretary of defense's critique
of this president?
Secretary Defense Hanna is a four-star Marine General
with over  years of service to this country.
I understand his frustration.
Is there any truth to the idea that Mark Usher
is the Dick Cheney of this White House?
No, there is only one Dick Cheney.
  Okay, fair enough.   Mark Usher is
the Mark Usher of this White House.
So, how would you characterize the vice president's role?
The vice president has the full support of the entire cabinet.
And the president?
Well, the president speaks for herself.
Are you suggesting that the Secretary of Defense
is not the only one who's frustrated with this president?
You know, Lawrence, this town feeds off of rumor and gossip
  and it's counter-productive.   Raha?
It's a distraction. I don't work that way.
You don't work that way. How do you work?
  How do you work with this president?   You have a call.
It's your president.
Is this a dysfunctional administration?
My relationship with this...
Claire.
Jane, I just need to know
exactly when they're going to pull the trigger.
Don't you want to come home?
You look like you're having fun.
I see real affection there.
And, listen, there were rumors about Tom and me, of course,
but nothing to them.
He was like a brother to me.
So comforting.
Which is what makes this all the more difficult.
The truth is, Kelsey...
the Russians killed Tom...
and Mark Usher covered it up.
Now, I'm doing my best to hold him accountable,
but I need your help.
I need you to tell the FBI
about your relationship with Tom.
  Madam President, I     I know. It's fine.
You just say you were dating.
You were in love.
And in a private moment,
he told you about his suspicions regarding
Mark Usher and his collusion with Russia.
And the last time you saw him,
he was on his way to the vice president's home
to confront him.
I'm not going to let the vice president get away with this.
You and I, as women,
we have to fight back.
I need you by my side.
And before we transmit the letter,
I'd like to suggest we all take a moment to bow our heads
and pray for this great nation.
Could you pass me that letter?
And gather all of your things.
Every single cabinet member in this room
is dismissed.
You're all fired.
Escort them out.
You know,
I never took you for someone
who wanted to get himself into the Oval.
All it is, is a four year job, eight if you're lucky.
Where are you?
What?
All right. I'm on my way back.
Listen, if she prevented the signing, that's obstruction.
And likely, it's impeachable.
You hear me?
Details are still coming in.
But we're being told there are reports that the FBI...
  Mark.   ...has today been provided evidence...
  Get to a television.   ...that Mark Usher had quote...
  Or a computer.   ..."significant and ongoing...
Or a goddamn radio.
...contact outside the logs with Russian officials."
This leading up to and during the president's
recent polarizing Syrian peace deal.
The FBI's expected to look into the matter,
but has yet to announce whether or not they are opening
an official investigation.
If so, this could be a catastrophic setback
for an already-beleaguered administration.
Before we begin, I'd like to offer you the chance to resign.
I'll leave you to it then.
I never had any contact with any Russians outside the logs. None.
You vacationed at Deputy Foreign Minister Zorkin's family dacha
  on the Black Sea in summer .   That was  years ago.
Let's work backwards, start with questionsthat have arisen
after Ms. Kelsey Stewart's deposition.
Who?
We located her phone in a liquor store in Bellport.
She knows about the app.
We should assume so.
Have you told my uncle yet?
I can't reach him.
I can't reach your mother, either.
We have some men tracking the journalist.
But we don't even know if she has her hands on anything yet.
  Package for Mr. Shepherd.   Oh, thank you.
This is addressed to you.
Leave me alone, please.
My name is Catherine Durant.
Today is Tuesday, July , .
And the time...
Now, before I begin, let me just say...
that every punishment
that history will surely visit upon Claire Underwood
will be exactly what she deserves.
I rue the day that I accepted her husband's offer
of secretary of state.
Now, then...
I hereby swear that everything I'm about to say is the truth.
Her husband has disappeared, as of six hours ago.
  Do you want to hear any more?   No.
I know the rest.
Do you think the Russians got them out?
Uh, no, I'm sure of it.
Do you think she sent it to anyone else?
We would know about it by now.
I've asked Nathan to be available to you.
I know how well you two work with one another.
We'll find her.
And, Doug, I haven't forgotten
about the promise we made to each other.
I hope you haven't.
I just got back from New Mexico.
What did you do with Rachel? Or is it Cassie?
I'm five minutes away.
Hang up the phone.
  Doug     Hang it up
or you'll never hear from me again.
I'll come to you.
Nathan,
are you still listening?
You're a fool to think she'll protect you.
Seems fitting, somehow, that you're the first
person I meet with after I've returned to work.
There's something very full circle about it.
So, you've talked to your son.
Or rather, not your son.
Do you know how developed a fetus is by then?
Sixteen weeks is...
beyond the beyond.
That is what  weeks looks like.
That is what I can't get out of my head.
I'm quoting Melody Cruz here, by the way.
She just taped her segment, due to run tomorrow.
Visual aids and everything.
For the first time ever, Americans will hear the story
of a childless president...
who had an abortion,
while married,
at  weeks.
I wanted to see your face.
I wanted to see Frank's betrayal register.
Nobody can keep their mouths shut these days.
Not even to-the-death secrets are safe.
It's shameful.
But honestly, what's worse?
That he betrayed your secret
or that you waited until  weeks?
You and your party.
Your moral rectitude, how convenient.
You don't even believe half of what you say, Annette.
Run it.
Cruz's piece.
Run it.
And then go home
and talk to Duncan about the beginning of life.
But actually before you go,
I want to show you something. Come with me.
Meet my new cabinet.
I just wanted to see your face.
Thank you all for assembling at such short notice.
And I want to thank you for your willingness to serve.
I am looking forward to building a new America together
and our work begins today.
Now, if you could all
place your left hand on the Constitution in front of you.

I do solemnly swear
to take no prisoners.House.of.Cards.SE
She only needs to be deficient.
The Cabinet is yours.
Resign.
There's an e-mail from Bill Shepherd's office in the chain.
They knew somebody was gonna die.
That's not Rachel Posner.
Is she dead?
I just got back from New Mexico.
What did you do with Rachel?
She's somewhere in Saudi Arabia.
But nothing can happen without an executive order.
Well, then.
That's gonna have to happen when you're president.
The Russians killed Tom...
and Mark Usher covered it up.
I need you to tell the FBI
about your relationship with Tom.
You're all fired.
Ask Annette  
Ask your mother.
She told me to ask you where I came from.
Meet my new cabinet.
I just wanted to see your face.
The will you intercepted? Where is it?
I don't have it anymore.
He left you everything.
That's how the will ends.
"Remember the last thing I gave you."
Francis died in this room.
Whoever killed him
will get what she or he deserves.
Tom.
Tom, you here?
Tom!
Sources say that the FBI was made aware of the evidence
linking the vice president and a number of cabinet secretaries
with several senior Russian government officials.
Meanwhile, President Underwood,
who has still not commented on the matter,
in what could be construed as an attempt to distance herself
and her administration from the apparent collusion,
has fired all the accused cabinet secretaries,
making way for the first-ever
all-female cabinet in US history.
Not one, not two,
but three abortions.
The third one at  weeks.
Think about it.
That's not a few cells
or a collection of cells.
It's more like four and a half inches long
and three and a half ounces.
At  weeks,
the President's baby would have been the size...
of this.
My fellow Americans, there are certain parties out there
that hope to use my private life for political gain.
I'm going to say this exactly once.
For many years, my late husband and I tried to start a family.
I downplayed that fact in the past because...
Well, it's a painful subject.
When I finally became pregnant,
the baby wasn't viable,
and the pregnancy had to be terminated.
End of story.
The baby was viable.
Francis and I, as parents, were not.
So, let me be clear.
This is the last I will ever say on this subject.
Okay.
I am so proud of every person around this table.
Each of them has served this country
with honor and distinction.
Some as deputy secretaries.
They are all accomplished Americans
and members of their respective departments.
But I'll let them speak for themselves.
Hello, my name is Jennifer Baumgarten,
and I am the acting Attorney General of the United States.
Jenny's going to come in very handy.
And as far as the Justice Department is concerned,
I share the President's commitment to cleaning house.
But isn't it customary for the vice president
to attend all cabinet meetings?
Not necessarily, no.
Listen, ever since I joined the Underwood administration,
the President and I have worked together on a daily basis.
Hand in glove. That's the way we work.
Is it true that you were asked to resign?
What? No.
No.
And the Russians and me, it's preposterous.
Look, the President and I agree
the best way to find out who's behind these accusations
is to appoint a special prosecutor.
And let him or her do her job.
  Thanks very much.   One more question, one question!
Mr. Vice President, one question.
One more question!
Mr. Vice President!
Mr. Vice President, one question, one more question!
Okay. Great. Thank you. Great.
Okay, good. Thanks, thanks. Bye.
Did she find him?
Tom.
  Did she find him?   No.
Front door was open.
Dog's not there. No one was there.
Okay, Tom, I am so sorry. I felt like I had no other option.
I mean, I swear,
  I saw someone inside your...   No, I know. I know.
We can go circle back and take another look if you want, but...
That doesn't sound like a good idea.
That's your fax.
Great.
How much is that?
   for the first page,    for each additional.
And it looks like you've got quite a few additionals coming in.
But can I just...
Let me just figure out how much it's gonna cost.
That's more than enough.
Yeah, thank you.
Here you go.
  Thank you.   You bet.
Why did you send the nurse away?
Because she needed to eat.
And I feel fine.
  I find this anything but fine.   No, no, look...
This fever's good.
I don't think it's supposed to last this long.
Do you want me to change the sheets?
What's the point?
You know, I support you no matter what.
Whatever you want to try,
but this is...
Research is very good.
Proven effective in Europe.
Do you remember
how dad used to make me wear long sleeves at dinner?
Do you miss them?
Her, not him.
He was always so sure about what was right.
Mom's doubt actually allowed her to deepen as time went by.
Depth is overrated.
Do you want to cancel tomorrow?
We can't cancel.
What's wrong, Annie?
Annie?
I keep calling Duncan.
And I've heard nothing, and he still hasn't gone home.
You knew he was gonna find out someday.
Maybe it's for the best.
If you're hungry or thirsty...
Angry. Tired. Frustrated.
I should've been debriefed by now.
Again, if you need water or a cup of coffee...
This is ridiculous.
Excuse me.
No visible scars.
I assume you've been looked at by a physician.
It's protocol.
So is talking with a senior member of the Agency.
That won't be happening today.
You're essentially burnt
when it comes to your work with any of the agencies.
That's the term, isn't it, burnt?
Not necessarily.
Virtually always.
Nobody knows what you said or didn't say while in captivity.
I didn't say, Claire.
Madam President.
Oh, and have you heard about Mark?
He's made quite a spectacle of himself.
I don't know how much longer I can keep my voice out of it.
I guess he thought he could come out from under it.
Yes. Well, the people that know us best,
know best how to hurt us.
President Underwood...
Actually, I've gone back to "Hale."
You're wrong if you think I have...
You are foolish if you don't tell me what it is.
Guess which kind of people I'm done suffering, Jane.
You were wise to come.
I told you and I'll tell them.
I don't want the job.
Doug, just promise you'll hear them out before you do anything.
And just so you're aware, Bill's not shaking hands at the moment.
Doug. May I introduce you?
Annette and Bill Shepherd.
Hello.
You remember Fred Amburg.
Doug, for the record,
I really enjoyed our conversations in the facility.
Come on, man.
All roads lead to Rome, you know?
And Annette and Bill are Rome.
Come. Sit down, please, Mr. Stamper.
These guys were just leaving.
Well, Mr. Shepherd,
  Annette.   Brett.
Talk soon, Bill.
  Fred.   Annette.
Frank spoke very highly of you, Doug.
You cold? I can have 'em switch off the AC.
Humidity in this town, my God,
makes you feel like
you're living inside the mouth of a dog, doesn't it?
Frederic Gustav Amburg
is my very best friend
over  years.
We've traded marbles,
stocks...
a fiance once upon a time.
Please. You're making me nervous standing there.
Oh, Jesus Christ. Get over it.
You should consider yourself lucky
you had Fred to talk to in there.
You're like the guy who finds  , and says
"Yeah, but it isn't a million."
Brett Cole will be the speaker.
Next in line, if you don't count Mark.
We've gotta get this woman outta there!
Mr. Stamper, my brother gets a little impatient
when it comes to the President.
We know we share a common enemy in her.
Whatever he left you must be damning.
We know that much.
Frank knew you were the only other man
who truly knew what his wife was capable of.
The only one he could trust
to do the right thing when the time came.
Unless, Frank was wrong about you.
A letter opener.
What does that mean?
How did you get your hands on the will?
It's called reach.
You see, the thing is,
whatever brings her down,
could bring Francis down, as well.
Now you listen to me.
Frank was a hell of a guy.
We were going to accomplish great things together.
But this is too damn important for the future of this country.
A future that includes you.
The past is just that.
Hold on a second.
Do you work for the brother or the sister?
The family.
She's not that fond of you.
I wanted you to know.
What? That I was working for them all along?
One way or another, Francis got both of us hired.
We know you've been meeting with Tom Hammerschmidt.
You need to stay away from him for a while.
God, this thing takes forever.
I have done nothing wrong.
And I'll tell you something, I am going to expose her.
And yourself.
And then where will you be?
  You're not thinking, Mark.   What happened?
Did she get to you?
She got to you, is that what you're saying?
I'm saying something's changed in those steely blue eyes of hers.
Walk away.
My recommendation is walk away from this shit show.
No. I'm not doing that.
You never even wanted this.
And now you're willing to fight to the death for it?
Who said anything about "the death?"
Fuck her, Jane.
Fuck!
Fuck her.
Forgive me,
but why is your timing always off?
I tried to get you out.
Out.
What a quaint concept.
When the only way out was never to get in in the first place.
I swore. I swore.
I swore I would never set foot in this house again.
What the hell are you doing here?
The optics are awful, Mark.
I mean, really.
It's the only place I feel safe.
That looks lovely. I don't blame her for choosing it.
And that blue-green color,
it's so specific to the French Alps.
Azure, yes, azure.
Well, of course our little tariff agreement
caused some consternation, Viktor,
but I don't regret it. Tell me you don't, either.
Right now?
Nothing, really.
Just planning for the future.
Out with the old.
Yeah.
And exactly who the fuck was Jennifer Baumgarten  hours ago?
Because I want you to push for a special prosecutor.
Or... Well, hearings then.
Because it will if you...
Mitch, don't give me that.
It will if you do.
Because I was a Republican a lot longer
than I was a Democrat. You know it.
  Listen to me, Mitch...   Considering the latest revelations
regarding the vice president, there's no denying it.
These are serious allegations that cannot be ignored.
And something tells me this is just the tip of the iceberg.
I mean, how deep does this go?
  What? I'll call you back.   And to what end?
  We deserve to know. Look...   'Cause I need to call you back.
People want to associate me with one party or another.
I'm simply an American when it comes to values,
way of life.
You have Ms. Stewart meeting with Tom Yates
in the vice president's home.
Tom Yates, who we now know
was someone the Russians were very interested in.
And now you have the vice president
holed up in that safe house,
assuring us that everything is...
Every news outlet is asking for comment.
It doesn't take a genius to realize...
It's terrible how people live to see others fail.
It's going to be hard for me to continue here in any capacity.
On the contrary, Kelsey,
I am naming you my permanent press secretary.
  Ma'am, I ca... I...   I'm going to announce it
the next time I take questions.
For the time being, though,
I think I should handle the daily press briefings.
I feel like I need to give them a little face time.
You don't understand, I can't...
I will let you know when you need to speak.
Don't worry. We'll get through this together.
Listen, I saw this in my closet today.
And I thought of you.
I want you to have it.
Tom was looking to move back to New York.
We would have coffee, the occasional dinner.
He told me he was involved with somebody
he couldn't get away from.
That it was killing him.
I can't think about it.
I won't think about it.
What to do about Kelsey?
I mean, look at that face.
Enjoy the bag.
So what Melody Cruz just said on the air,
that was your son, I'm guessing.
You need to talk to him or I will.
  Keep your voice down. Bill's resting.   Where is Duncan?
  Not here.   Bill. Bill Shepard.
Won't be seeing you today.
Still wearing it?
Why are you allowing me to be gutted?
  Gutted?   Yes, gutted.
Gutted, gutted.
I told Melody Cruz to run the piece.
I have been nothing but loyal to you.
The press secretary was in your house
  with Tom Yates.   Oh, my God. Come on.
Even if there isn't an ounce of truth to it.
Mark, you're the face of this whole Russia fiasco.
It's bad for the country.
It's bad for Bill and me.
You need to get rid of it.
Burn your house down, if you have to.
Anything that connects you to the story
and get a hold of yourself.
How's the Bureau feeling about the latest revelations
when it comes to Mark Usher?
It's difficult when all the evidence
is coming from Russian intelligence.
But we have to follow every lead.
To be honest, ma'am,
the vice president is well-liked around town.
Yes, but we're talking about very serious crimes here, Nathan.
Yes, ma'am.
So, tell me, once Doug knew you were listening in...
He's been operating pretty much in plain sight.
He tried to meet with Tom Hammerschmidt.
Again?
And he met with Bill and Annette Shepherd at the Hay-Adams.
Also, he returned to his apartment with a canine.
Doug has a dog?
There's one in his apartment.
Another thing that caught my attention
was the two men we have following
Doug's psychiatrist from the facility contacted me.
Seems Dr. Rosen was pretty shaken up.
He said he blacked out and fell down.
But I mean, it doesn't make any sense...
  You sound very distracted, Nathan.   Excuse me?
I don't know if it's the lack of sleep
because of the night feedings,
but I wonder if you're still capable of doing the job
that I expect of you.
I promise you, ma'am,
I'm fully capable of executing my duties.
Boy or girl?
  A boy.   I'm so happy for you, Nathan.
They do say second marriages are the best.
What time is it?
Don't worry about it.
Are you okay?
Can I check your temperature?
No.
Every time I wake up,
you people put your hands all over me.
When I went to bed, I was  years old.
I don't know how old I am.
Was Mark here?
I heard these voices, I was going in and out.
  Seth!   Bill,
  maybe you should go back to your room.   No, I'm not dead yet.
Was he here?
  Yes, but...   Okay. Well, where is Ms. Skorsky?
We have people looking for her.
We're fairly sure she's still in the DC area.
But what does she have?
We now know that Ray Meyers
was faxing some kind of document
to a copy shop here in the city.
And anything from your Doug Stamper?
No, sir.
Bill, please, you're still feverish.
Can you give us a minute?
Of course.
Where is he?
He's safe.
Which is more than I can say for you.
You know, at times I can't tell if you're making a threat
or offering help.
Why is Seth Grayson looking for Janine Skorsky?
I'm assuming the men
who turned your place upside down were looking for her.
She's working on an article.
But she'll have to find someplace else to publish.
Her newspaper was bought by the Shepherds.
We still need to meet, Tom.
Yeah.
And, Doug,
you lay a hand on that innocent animal,
and I swear to Christ, I'll beat the living shit out of you.
Your dog's fine.
Seth?
I know you look up to my brother.
And you've been very attentive.
But he's not well, okay?
And from this moment on,
any information you think he needs,
I need to hear it first.
I understand.
He will recover.
Thank you for saying that.
Doug Stamper doesn't like to be told what to do.
It only works if he thinks it's his idea.
Listen,
it may be none of my business,
but I haven't been able to reach Duncan
since he received a package from the White House.
I don't know what it was.
But he was very upset.
Thank you.
You're right.
That's none of your business.
I urged him. Believe me.
I urged him to resign,
but he listens to me half the time, at best.
I need you to understand.
I don't want to hurt Mark again.
There was a troubled young woman...
I wonder why so many stories have to begin that way.
I know. I know. I hate this story.
I hate that I'm telling you.
I'm tired of the disposable girl story.
She started as a volunteer on Brett Cole's first campaign.
Mark and I were consulting.
Brett's wife was as pregnant as could be.
And the troubled young woman wouldn't leave him alone.
Well, that's how Brett characterized it.
Did he encourage her attention?
Enjoy it?
You bet he did.
He's a man with a man's ego.
Anyway, of course it became a mess
in all the ways these stories do.
And suddenly, it was Mark's job to clean it up.
He leaned on her too hard.
Badgered and berated her.
"You're ruining Brett's future.
You better disappear."
And so she did.
She jumped off the Roosevelt Bridge.
It fucked with Mark's head, Claire.
He lost his nerve after that. He...
He started to question everything.
Everything.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
I'm... I mean, this is not me.
Jane.
You're saving him, you know that, right?
Now, tell me the truth.
Did you help Cathy get away?
The FSB have been very helpful, so you know.
They're very close to locating Cathy.
I've noticed that you always adjust your hair
right before you tell a lie.
I want you to know I forgive you.
She wants to try and impeach me?
Be my guest, I cannot wait.
They hate her, you know.
The House, all the Senators, they hate her guts.
By the time this thing is over, she'll be begging me to...
Don't do this.
Everything I've done for that ungrateful...
Don't let this happen again.
I didn't take proper care of you.
As a friend.
Machiavelli died in exile.
Boss Tweed made a deal with the governor,
but in the end, was never released.
Where are you, Jane?
And Nixon was a prisoner of his past
till the day he died.
All men who had no idea how to walk away.
I am still in possession of his body,
and I'll use it, if I have to.
Oh, God.
No matter what you hear,
I was trying to help you.
Jane.
  It's around the back.   You did good.
What is it?
What does she have?
You don't have to concern yourself with that.
I delivered her, didn't I?
Whatever Janine Skorsky has will never see the light of day.
She has no right to it.
And her source will be singing a different tune
when he sees the jail time he's looking at.
Listen to you, Mr. Grayson.
By the way, what's your title?
Vice president of research and outreach
for the Shepherd Freedom Foundation.
You're like a starfish, Seth.
Your legs grow back.
Here's her article.
  And the emails?   There's a copy attached.
Seth's on his way.
And Janine says thank you for the head's up.
He'll bring the cavalry.
Calamity Janine can handle herself.
My dog?
All right, then.
Did you kill Rachel?
I need to hear you say it.
You need it for yourself.
I did.
But you won't find her.
No one will.
Turn yourself in.
Take me.
Point me in the direction where you left her.
There are people who cared for her.
I cared for her.
Did Francis kill Zoe?
Tell me if Francis killed Zoe.
Is this still off the record?
Will it be enough for you to know the truth?
Because you're never gonna be able to prove it.
Tom, it has to be enough, or I walk away.
  No. Someone has to answer...   Jesus Christ, he's dead.
But her...
You said it yourself, she's as guilty as he is.
I'm saying, maybe more.
Maybe he did it all for her.
What d'you got?
Do we have an agreement?
I give you the truth, and you leave him out of it.
I can't do that.
It's not a just world, Tom.
But sometimes you have the chance to make the right person pay,
even if it's for the wrong crime.
Is that enough for you?
Because if it's not, I respect you,
and we can say goodbye.
  No, Doug. It's not enough for me.   Tom.
  And I do not agree!   Tom.
I am never going to tell you
that Francis killed the three of them,
Zoe, Russo
and LeAnn.
But you already know the truth.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
On the record.
From here.
What did she do?
Ms. Skorsky.
Members of the US Attorney Cyber Task Force are on their way.
I'm giving you a chance.
And I'm giving you a chance to go on the record.
Emails or any correspondence written while at Arcas Refinery
or any subsidiary of Shepherd Unlimited
are the sole property of Bill and Annette Shepherd.
Were Bill and Annette Shepherd aware of the possibility
that workers might die at the Arcas plant?
Get that outta my face.
We know what Ray Meyers sent you.
Did you use the Arcas accident
to get the citizens of Bellport to sign up for this app?
An app that you helped develop
for the Shepherd Freedom Foundation?
Ms. Skorsky,
they're about to confiscate your computer and any devices.
You can take it right now.
You're not gonna find anything here.
I knew you were coming, Mr. Grayson.
Doug.
I'm ready to see the President.
You expect a person to be true to his character.
You're so careful.
You're so good about cleaning up after yourself.
Why didn't you just get rid of him?
Well, Francis wanted it otherwise.
I was so hoping you'd surprise me.
What are you gonna do, Mark?
You gonna pull out the body,
drape it over the tombstone?
Gelsemium is known to be used by Russian intelligence.
I want you out of my house.
But from what I understand, you're pretty much a murderer anyway.
You don't normally make mistakes, do you?
But when you do,
they are something.
Was there some hope in you that
the troubled young woman would do herself in?
That Congressman Cole would be relieved somehow.
I'd like you to get out of my house, Claire.
It's important to be organized and ruthless.
Three piles, I always say.
The stuff you wanna keep.
The stuff you might need later that you put in storage.
And the stuff you have to destroy.
  Jane, it's me.   I'm so sorry.
I don't care that you told her.
You hear me? I don't care.
I have the worst migraine
of my life.
Jane.
Jane, are you okay?
Are you okay?
Jane.
I almost forgot. There's always a fourth pile.
The stuff you don't know what to do with.
Can I get you some water?
Something stronger, maybe?
No, thank you. But don't let me stop you.
I take a month off drinking, come every Labor Day.
Kind of an academic calendar ritual
to prove to myself I'm not actually an alcoholic.
I'm actually abstaining myself, at the moment.
For pursuit of...
clarity, I guess.
Would you like to sit down?
Sure.
He's crazy.
Certifiable. You know that, right?
Doug got out of a psychiatric facility
all of a month and a half ago.
And no matter how hard he tries to revive his political career
or get back in the game...
He's a delusional liar.
And to tell you the truth,
maybe he was a better wife to Francis.
Which is why he was never able to see things clearly.
I mean, what did he tell you, Tom?
What do you think he told me that you don't want me to know?
Boy. The fantasies he must have reported to you.
You need to pity him.
You really do. I do.
Madam President, this type of intrusion
  into a civilian's home...   Listen, there's no denying
that Francis was a desperate man who did,
yes, a lot of desperate things.
And I don't know. Maybe towards the end,
he was slightly deranged.
But whatever he did, he did alone.
I was not complicit.
And do you... Do you remember the last interview
you did with my husband?
And the conversation ended where he asked you
if you'd believed what he'd told you.
Do you remember how you responded, Tom?
I do.
I said, "Not for a second."
Madam President,
when it comes to your complicity,
I think it's best if we meet under more formal circumstances.
I'll be sending over a list of questions to your press office.
You can answer them by mail, email.
Or if you prefer, face-to-face and on the record.
How many years did she clean up after you?
My mother, the housekeeper.
From the second I saw you, Duncan.
Your beautiful little scrunched up face.
Like an old man.
I just knew. It was instant.
We just belonged,
we belonged, we did.
Why didn't you legally adopt me?
I guess, because I didn't have to.
And my father?
Was it...
Oh, no, no, no.
A one night stand.
She...
said she didn't remember his name.
I went to see her.
My birth mother.
She lives not more than half an hour from here.
Did you know that?
Did you talk to her?
Couldn't.
I couldn't do that to her.
I just...
I just watched her.
How could she let...
I knew I could take care of you.
I knew she couldn't.
If not now,
I hope you can forgive me.
You okay, Duncan?
Help me, Bill.
Who your real parents were, where they came from...
I never cared about any of that.
Because...
Well, you know why.
Say it.
Who he is, Bill.
I don't need this.
Stay where you are.
  No.   Duncan,
if you and I are to have any chance,
you need to stay right here.
Bill, say it.
Who he is to you. To me.
Honey...
Who is he, goddamn it?
He's not one of us.
You're a coward.
Letting Claire Hale say it for you.
Well, I hope you die.
Let's go. Now!
The email links to corporate minutes that clearly indicate
a foreknowledge of hazard
that resulted in catastrophic harm and loss of life.
In attendance and party to consent of the corporate policy
was the entity's chief executive officer William Shepherd.
Arcas Refinery is liable.
As is Shepherd Unlimited.
The corporation and Bill Shepherd himself can be charged
with involuntary manslaughter.
Expose him as a murderer
and cost him billions in the process.
Is Ms. Skorsky publishing?
I made sure of it.
It's a better story once you arrest him.
And the article will justify the arrest.
We can get some lawyers in here and delay, at the very least.
No.
Then we can make sure they walk you out the back.
No, no, no.
No, no. I want the cuffs.
President's gone too far this time.
I want the whole world to see.
And my sister?
You could've handed me this anywhere, why here?
Seemed appropriate.
You never struck me as nostalgic, Doug.
Could this be about the posthumous pardoning
you've been imagining for Francis?
You don't belong here.
I sometimes worry about your imagination.
Your slavish devotion.
You can't think beyond him. Not really.
I can imagine you not in the White House quite clearly.
Oh, my goodness.
You keep saying things like that,
I might not be able to let you leave.
What did you do with it?
The will.
Did you burn it?
He left me everything.
You know it, and I know it.
Excuse me.
I get sleepy so early these days.
I'm not going to be told what to do anymore, Doug.
Not by you or anyone or any man,
ever, ever again.
  Here, Tom.   Thanks, Dan.
  No problem.   Won't be long.
Whatever.
Turn.
Sit, sit.
Good boy, listen.
  Get down, below the counter.   Okay, okay.
You do exactly like I told you before, okay?
Remember, it's all about having fun, remember?
You be a good boy. It's gonna be all right.
Just have fun, okay? Okay.
And in breaking news just in,
we are sad to report that one of the Washington Herald's
most accomplished journalists and editors Tom Hammerschmidt
was pronounced dead at the scene of a robbery gone terribly wrong.
The White House was quick to comment,
as the President had sat down
with the award-winning Hammerschmidt
for an interview only hours before.
Along with her condolences,
the President used the opportunity to call for greater gun control,
particularly in our inner cities.
Fuck!
The last thing he gave you.
If you don't tell me what it means...
I was kind of hoping you could tell me, Claire.
Doug, Tom Hammerschmidt is dead.
Cathy, Jane.
Bill Shepherd is going to prison.
Mark has no one to turn to.
It's just you and me.
Gimme a moment, please.
Please know.
The thought of accelerating the exit
of three poor souls from this earth
is beyond painful.
Sorry about that.
Not at all.
I'm not worried about you anymore, Doug.
You wouldn't do anything to hurt Francis. You're not capable.
And see, the thing is...
whatever Francis left you, it doesn't actually belong to you.
We entered our marriage with a his, hers and ours agreement.
You keep and do whatever you want with yours,
I keep and do whatever I want with mine.
My daddy and mother insisted, as you can imagine.
But the prenup we had, had a clause.
If ever we have descendants together
and one of us is first to die,
we agree to waive our rights to everything passed on.
By which I mean,
all of Francis's assets
are entitled to his heir.
If he should have one.
Francis and I have been blessed.House.of.Cards.SE
Did you kill Rachel?
I did.
But you won't find her.
No one will.
I am deeply honored to be considered for the late Justice's seat.
How did they buy you? The Shepherds.
Brett Cole will be the speaker.
Next in line, if you don't count Mark.
We've gotta get this woman outta there!
Did you use the Arcas accident
to get the citizens of Bellport to sign up for this app?
An app that you helped develop
for the Shepherd Freedom Foundation?
Francis was a desperate man.
But whatever he did, he did alone.
I was not complicit.
I think it's best if we meet under more formal circumstances.
And on the record.
Why didn't you legally adopt me?
He's not one of us.
You're a coward.
Well, I hope you die.
The last thing he gave you.
I was kind of hoping you could tell me, Claire.
Tom Hammerschmidt is dead.
Cathy, Jane.
Bill Shepherd is going to prison.
Mark has no one to turn to.
It's just you and me.
Francis and I have been blessed.
There are two kinds of pain.
The sort of pain that makes you strong.
Or useless pain...
the sort of pain that's only suffering.
I have no patience for useless things.
I turn around and see her,
my darling wife, poised on the front stoop.
Surely she saw everything.
The killing, the lying about it, but doesn't say a word.
She just enters the house in quiet compliance.
This is love.
Everyone should be so  
My beloved Americans.
My heart is very full today.
I am here to talk about the future.
And the future has become very personal.
We are gathered here at the very center of our great nation
to celebrate this historic Women's Conference.
This is a profound moment for all Americans.
But it's also a perilous time in our history, my friends.
Because the American oligarchs out there,
they are coming for us.
They are trying to strip me of my constitutional power
as your Commander In Chief.
Now the lower court ruled in my favor,
but now they've taken this case
all the way to the Supreme Court.
And they want my finger off the nuclear button.
And I have to ask...
Why do you think that is?
These oligarchs,
through an innocent seeming app,
have been trying to steal the midterms
by crawling your phones,
invading your privacy
and telling you how to vote.
Now, are you gonna let them get away with it?
No!
We need to tell them to wake up!
Say it with me, Lebanon, Kansas.
It is time for Congress to...
Wake up!
And it's time for the Supreme Court to...
Wake up!
Now, my purpose is to elevate America,
fight for America,
and if it ever came to it, die for America.
I will be father, mother, leader and friend.
Thank you so much.
Father, mother, leader...
liar, killer.
Rest in peace, Rachel.
When's the footage from?
It's from several days ago.
He's been staying at a cabin.
Childhood cabin for three or four weeks.
We suspect he's in the mountains outside Los Cerillos now.
And did he find where he buried her?
We're still not sure.
Ma'am, I got a tip from a former agent.
One of the ones poking around Gaffney on behalf of the Shepherds.
Doug recently reached out to Seth Grayson.
Do we know what was discussed?
No, but it's the first time he's contacted
anyone connected with the Shepherds
since you last spoke to him.
Well, if he's trying to get caught, let's catch him.
So is Duncan Shepherd testifying or not?
His lawyers are negotiating the terms.
They're hoping that he could meet behind closed doors.
Well, then he needs to be subpoenaed.
Every congressperson we've spoken to
  agrees he should be and yet     They're delaying.
I mean,there's no real desire
to move this app investigation along.
They're protecting their own.
The House asked for these hearings.
The theatre is good for them.
But we are in constant contact
with the Democratic members of the committee, ma'am.
They're feeling the pressure.
Well, clearly, not enough.
We can start arresting congresspeople.
Pull them out of the chambers if we have to.
  The whole point of the hearings     Is what? Obfuscation?
What? We're talking about invasion of privacy here.
The US Attorney is resistant to pressing any kind of charges
  without hard evidence.   The app is the evidence.
  This is grounds for prosecution, Nora.   Yes, maybe.
But the US Attorney would argue  
Replace the US Attorney.
She's been dragging her feet on this for months.
Ma'am, we still live in a world of due process.
That would send a chilling message  
The message is we need to protect our democracy.
On a practical note, we're canceling the fourth stop today.
Upon reflection, we decided Toledo would be redundant with Cleveland.
Pam, it's fine. You can be honest.
The Commander In Chief
is feeling a little woozy today. That's all.
And yes, maybe a little cranky, but nothing serious. I promise.
When we touch down in Des Moines,
Nora, you can head straight back to DC.
Is it Slavic, "Skorsky"?
Polish, in my case.
You must be lonely.
I asked the press corps to take the second plane,
so that you and I could meet privately.
Four months ago, you met with two people.
One of them's missing and one of them is dead.
My life has certainly been punctuated with loss lately.
And just a bit of great luck.
Tom Hammerschmidt was not lucky.
No, he wasn't. That was tragic.
That's why I think you should pick up his mantle.
And tell the full story of Francis' political career.
Are you messing with me?
No. Far from it.
You did a great job investigating and exposing
the Shepherd Freedom Foundation app.
Its nefarious uses.
We can't let congresspeople get away with things like that.
I wonder if you'll get them in line
before the Supreme Court takes your power away.
Tom Hammerschmidt and I, the last time we spoke,
we talked about my husband.
And my hope is I could pick it up with you.
I have a lot that needs to be said about Francis,
his crimes and misdemeanors.
You want my story or don't you?
Oh, it's these mini contractions.
They're, um... called Braxton Hicks.
Do you have kids?
No, I don't.
Oh, the baby's really moving now.
It's kicking. Do you want to feel?
No, thank you.
Such a strange feeling.
To be wholly responsible for the life of another.
Also, I hear, when you have kids, you never...
sleep quite the same again.
There are two kinds of pain.
Doug Stamper sent me that text,
he said it comes from your husband's diary.
Now, I ask you,
who should I interview, you or him?
I know that some of you are here
because you're not sure
I'm gonna be around at next year's gathering.
Oh, no, no, I can see it on  
On your faces. And it's true.
These last few months, I've had to look back.
But I'm excited. I am.
As my sister told you,
there are changes coming to this country in the next few months.
The kind that I haven't been able to accomplish
in the  plus years that I've been at it.
It'll cut regulation for the people, give every man a chance.
You lead a man to fish, and he  
You want to lock me up in prison for that, then so be it, but...
Seize my assets.
Did you read...
finches dream?
Yeah, yeah.
They can   They have the  
They can sing to themselves when they sleep.
Where was I?
I have congressmen who want to break away.
Separate themselves from this.
Well, deflect and compliment.
That's how I survived the Hill.
These hearings will blow up on us, Mark.
Now, one way or another, we all used that motherfucking app.
And yes, they've been good to us, but...
why do we all have to pay for what the son set in motion?
Anything you want to say about Duncan,
you say it to Annette.
Well, I'm asking you to say it.
I can't believe I'm looking to you
for help again all these years later.
You were vice president.
I've rebuilt my career at least three times, Brett.
And I will continue to do so as long as I have to.
Too bad Jane Davis won't have that chance.
"What I am to Claire is not what I am to Zoe."
Do you know what it means?
Does he believe you should know what it means?
Yes. He added, "And that's what he left me..."
It belongs to some diary that Francis kept.
But not part of his presidential papers?
Whatever it is, it's information that President Underwood  
President Hale wants kept out of the light.
Doug implied that she got pregnant
so as to keep him from what was rightfully his.
When will you speak with him next?
My guess is the next time he finds a payphone or a burner.
I'd like to meet with him.
  Annette.   You're going to be famous, Brett.
Well, there's fame...
and then there's notoriety.
The bill you had your name on all those months ago...
will be upheld in the Supreme Court.
This is Judge Abruzzo's majority ruling.
  How did you     We helped him write it.
It's worded in such a way
that her powers will be diminished...
over time and across the board.
Mark gave you a sense of what we're thinking?
A bit.
You just need to run out the clock on these hearings.
After the midterms, you can send a powerful message.
Over the years, we've been lucky enough
to support an array of talented
and like-minded politicians.
We've essentially operated like a third party.
And one day,
in the not too distant future, we'll make it official.
Brett, you will be the leader of that party.
You'll be our man in the White House.
I told Brett how thankful we are
for keeping Duncan out of the spotlight.
I won't forget all you've done for him.
Well, that's actually a very good question, Bob.
Where do we rank as a country in the world?
You have to ask that. We're .
That's where we are. th.
  That is a disgrace     Speaking of disgrace,
I have a question for you, sir.
Did your family make you sick
with their chemical plants and their toxic sites?
Get her out of here.
You made yourself sick.
And you're killing all of us.
  Somebody take care of this young lady.   Of course
he's going to take me out. He is. You're killing all of us.
"I'm not gonna lie, I despise children.
There, I've said it."
What the hell is wrong with you?
"Thirty minutes ago I received a text from Zoe.
She intends to apologize, no doubt."
Wait, wait, what's that from?
That's what I'm saying.
Doug, come here. Let's meet.
"Rebellion on all fronts  "
"Claire, Zoe, Russo. I must not lose my resolve."
Hey, stop. Where are you?
No, no, no. That's not how this is gonna work.
Doug, we can find you.
It won't take very long.
I'll tell you where I am right now.
Right in the middle of nowhere.
I'm five minutes from out of here and out of fucking mind.
She just wants to sit with you.
I'm going to tell you what I want said and how.
They have the lawyers, the money. I don't.
They do what I tell them,
then I know we can meet.
You will get everything that you are due. I'll make sure of it.
When will I hear from you again?
I'm so sorry that they called you onto the plane, Dr. Larson.
I feel fine now.
All the same, you're getting close to a time
where jumping on and off a plane may not be the best idea.
You said you'd been feeling run down.
Yes, a little bit. But  
I think we should get you back to DC
to do some blood work as a precaution.
Okay, that's fine.
But unless I'm putting the baby in danger,
I've got two more appearances today.
I'd advise against that.
I cannot be the indisposed president, Dr. Larson.
I'm sure you're fine,
but your sample tells me you're a bit dehydrated.
At least let me get you on an IV.
It won't take long.
We'll get your fluids back to normal.
Is this really necessary?
He's a grown man.
If you'd rather have Seth
bring me the signed documents that's fine, too.
Annie, you have to admit
  this is the most cockamamie thing     That's Dad's word.
And please don't confuse me with someone
who's willing to listen to one more of your goddamn opinions.
Each of us will legally adopt him.
And when we're dead and gone, it will be Duncan...
who is the face, voice and embodiment
of Shepherd Unlimited.
I'm doing this for you.
  I'm late.   I'm signing.
Is it your plan to keep avoiding me?
  Bill.   Lordy, what exactly is it I did to you?
You think you know what's best for me.
I am not our father.
Would have been swell if you'd realized that sooner.
So glad you got to spend some time
with your friends like this, Bill.
I can't get that woman out of my head.
Do you think she was right?
Did we poison ourselves?
Is Abruzzo impeachable? Yes.
Would the Senate convict him?
Who knows?
But what does it matter?
You need him scared, and this might do it.
He received an interest-free loan
from a Shepherd-owned entity
for a lake house at the same time
that he was ruling on a case that involved
another part of that company.
Is everything all right?
Yes. Sorry. I'm just a little bit dehydrated.
Why hasn't this ever come up before, Walter?
Abruzzo was never fully-vetted.
By you, by anybody.
In a way, the fact that he was railroaded through
has proved to be your opportunity.
And the rest of the court?
Locked in.
Abruzzo's the swing vote.
We at the Shepherd Freedom Foundation,
freedom being the operative word there,
believe in the individual.
I could argue that our foundation is
more inclusive, more forward-looking
than any so-called progressive agenda.
Oh, listen.
Listen to you. You are so programmed
that you can't hear my argument.
Nathan. I wish I could help you.
Withholding information from
an ongoing investigation is a crime.
If you know anything about his whereabouts,
suggest you tell me.
What are you gonna do when all this is over?
I mean, think about it.
How long before you become
the one with too many secrets?
Our president scares me.
If anyone knows what she's been up to, it's you.
You have children, right?
How many wives?
Leave them out of it.
Can you?
My father was a cop.
My mom's a widow.
It's a hard life, Nathan.
All those years at the Bureau.
The time you put in, all that experience, it's valuable.
Where's Doug?
The thing about these events,
there's cameras everywhere.
Seth.
No, because this is where I turn to the camera.
And I say,
I don't know.
I'm sad to say, but there is a Russian troll factory
that has begun to manipulate your husband's accomplishments.
That's awful.
No. We caught them. But for instance,
records of his years at Harvard, his years at the Sentinel,
are virtually impossible to track down.
Now, instead you find fabrications about him.
They filled the air with noise, so to speak.
I know from last we spoke, you were concerned
something like this could happen.
Well, I was.
That someone had mentioned the possibility to me.
But I had no idea it could be done.
We have unfortunately entered an era
where our digital truths are vulnerable.
In that case,
couldn't these trolls amplify my husband's crimes as well?
Yes.
And those would be very difficult stories to take back.
Viktor, that would be terrible if that were to happen.
History belongs to the highest bidder now.
Well, I hope his reputation can survive his crimes.
And I hope  
No, no, no, no, no, no, not now.
Claire, something wrong?
  How's she doing?   She's tachycardiac
with elevated respirations, Q contractions.
You're  weeks pregnant, Madam President.
We need to give her four grams of mag. Start the drip.
Francis Underwood?
Francis Underwood.
Francis Underwood?
Why do you say his name like that?
Why would you get engaged?
I'm not engaged.
  Gretchen said     Gretchen should mind her own business.
I haven't answered him yet.
The sex can't be great with him,
it just can't.
The sex is great with you.
I thought we were gonna fuck our way across Europe
and China and Africa or wherever.
Who says we won't?
Francis fucking Underwood.
Reed. Would you stop?
I mean, come on. The guy's not your type.
Oh, because you are?
I'm your parents' type.
But I wouldn't be if they really knew me.
Which I guess is another way of saying yes.
I am your type.
Francis is the patron saint of animals.
He never stops talking.
Every time I see that guy, his mouth is running.
Because he always has an audience
and you never know what he's going to say.
Claire Hale.
What do you want?
What?
I want...
every door to be wide open
and stay that way.
Then call him...
and tell him it's over, because you're coming with me.
I am?
Hi, Francis, it's me.
I'm five minutes away.
Someone will have to get to the bottom of it, Madam President.
I mean...
Pitocin induces labor.
She'll never practice again.
Is the baby gonna be okay?
The baby is fine.
Here we go.
Would you like to know the sex?
Hello.
You fucking cunt. It's a girl.
I'm coming for you, Claire.
I'm not gonna run, Nathan.
by a  degrees,  minutes,  seconds west.
What are you talking about?
It's where Rachel Posner is buried.
Let me ask you something, Nathan.
After all this time.
All these years together. Everything that we did for Frank.
Stuff with Lucas,
Macallan,
the terrorist kid.
Everything we ever did.
Are you seriously telling me, you're gonna choose her?
Literally, all I care about is getting out of this alive.
Get in.
How is it possible we still haven't found him?
Last time anybody saw him,
he was in New Mexico near a border checkpoint.
You honestly believe he's out of the country?
It just doesn't fit, Nathan. It's not like him to leave.
When's the last time he had contact with the Shepherds?
I gather he did convey a few more curious quotes to Mr. Grayson.
But at this point, the feeling is
they're like the ravings of a crazy person.
We'll speak later.
How did he get  
Oh, no, no, no, sweetheart.
I will not reap...
what your father has sown.
Is everything all right, Madam President?
Yes.
I was just looking for something.
Ma'am, Congressman Cole's here.
Shall I send him in?
Yes.
  Madam President.   Brett.
I wonder if you would do me a favor.
The George Washington painting.
Would you mind hanging that back up over the mantle?
No.
Thank you so much and thank you for coming.
Please have a seat.
Now, the Shepherds started backing you when?
Was that during or after your tragic affair
with the poor young woman?
My wife knows about the affair.
  There was no way I could have predicted     Don't worry.
I wasn't planning on using that nasty little piece of business.
I just wanted to gauge how long this was going to take.
So, putting the Senate aside,
how many members of the House were using that app?
Ballpark figure is fine.
That's what our judiciary hearings are trying to determine.
I'll go straight to arrests if I have to.
This is treason, Brett.
Somebody will go down for it.
So, I guess the real question is will you?
Because I know the chair in this room that you're gunning for
is not the one your ass is currently warming.
Forgive me.
I think pregnancy has brought out the sailor in me.
So.
What you're going to say to the press
as soon as this meeting is over.
You're going to say that you asked to meet with me
so that you could report some good old-fashioned quid pro quo
that came to your attention.
That my recent Supreme Court appointee
was found trading a favorable ruling for a lake house.
Shocking.
And that you and I both knew
that the only choice you then had
was to go to congress and initiate  
No Supreme Court justice has ever been impeached.
The good Justice Abruzzo
wouldn't want to be the first then, would he?
Justice Abruzzo...
is black.
Which makes this all the more  
There's that word again, tragic.
Madam President.
Before you explain to me how we shouldn't be meeting
or how Brett shouldn't be here,
separation of branches and all that.
We are considering a case
that will directly affect the office of the presidency.
I know, a case based on the monumental piece of legislation
co-signed by Brett.
But the three of us standing here right now
have nothing to do with that.
Isn't that right, Congressman?
Yes, Madam President.
I'll let the speaker explain.
'Cause you have a number of options to consider.
And I want you to know how truly embarrassing it is for me.
The sad fate of my choice for the court.
And by the way, I love Lake Champlain.
I've only been there twice,
but I'll never forget the thrilling shock
of the cold water on my feet.
My grandson has MS. He needs to swim.
I don't judge, Justice Abruzzo.
I'll correct that. Except for mendacity.
That I can't support.
And, Brett, when you report this back to the Shepherds,
give them my best.
As a Shepherd, you know it's your duty to
give back to the arts and the communities you're involved in.
You know, everything we've ever done at Gardner Analytics
is to serve the user.
You've made that clear, yes.
And yet, you were aware of the amount of data
the user was essentially signing over to you.
No more than any other application.
But the White House is saying
that the Shepherd Freedom Foundation app
went beyond any other application.
That it allowed congressional campaigns
complete access to the user's phone.
Some are even saying that
the app is essentially mining peoples' psyches.
Look.
You design the thing, but at the end of the day,
you have no idea how it will be used.
Mr. Shepherd.
Could you excuse me for one moment, please?
I'm Agent Slater with the FBI.
What's this about?
Please come with us.
I'm not going anywhere until I call my lawyer.
Mr. Shepherd, please.
It'd be best if you cooperated.
Abruzzo is recusing himself.
On what grounds?
His conflict of interest.
This is about the future of the presidency.
He's using his military service.
Get him over here.
It's too late, he can't reverse himself.
I decide when it's too late.
I will not have that ruling upheld.
Who else can we get to?
Barry.
Annette, do not turn on the TV.
What are you talking about?
They took him. They came in with a warrant.
What do you mean they took him?
They're using his work with the app
as grounds to charge him with treason.
I promise you, we will do everything we can.
But anyone connected with the app
is distancing themselves from it and you.
It's finally here.
Where did these changes come from?
Directly from the Shepherd family.
His mother?
Look, just do your thing. Let's get it on tape.
Nazi-like tactics?
You bring up Nazis in any situation
other than the Second World War,
you've already lost the argument.
I mean, come on, we all knew what Duncan was doing.
Is anybody really surprised?
  I mean, really?   Melody...
What?
  What are you     No.
She's polling in the high s.
We're looking at close to  by the midterms.
The anti-corporate rant
is gaining traction.
She's weaponized her feminism,
and it's grown tiresome.
"I'm a mother, I'm a general."
Spare me.
Anyone that popular is bad for democracy.
Mark.
So, the pros.
After her death, with the vice presidency vacant,
our friend Brett Cole will be president.
We suspect we'll get a call for stability and unity.
Heal the nation, we all know the drill.
The cons. We're gonna take a hit in the midterms.
I think we hold on to the House.
The Senate is a long shot.
The markets will fluctuate for a while.
I've brought Lorraine in for that.
She's got some impressive
computer models and projections. But...
all in all, we're confident we can absorb
whatever financial hit
an assassination would have on the economy.
We're talking about a quarter point loss
in the GDP, at the most.
And what about all the conspiracy nonsense we'll be hearing?
The theories are a useful distraction.
And eventually, they consume themselves.
History will back us up on that.
There's one hiccup. It's a big one.
She's with child.
That is a variable we don't know
how to account for in our models or predict.
We use it. Play into it.
We'll make her a martyr.
A victim of the times.
A feminist icon.
God, she might even end up on a coin.
As long as another Zapruder doesn't show up.
Jack, that's not funny.
Well, that's as much as I want to know.
Yes, I think it's best if you all leave now.
I'll take it from here.
Bring him in.
It's  o'clock, as they say.
You want what I have.
Actually, I want you to hold on to it.
I told Seth, and I'll tell you again.
I want to bring her down, but not Francis.
Don't you know that's impossible?
Even if she killed her husband?
Doug...
my goal and yours have become the same.
Does she call you Doug?
Or does she do that Francis thing of hers.
Douglas.
You know what we need to do.
You keep mistaking me for someone I'm not.
I don't care about you or what you want.
But you do care what Frank wanted.
And it's time you admitted it.
Frank wanted her dead.
This seems too personal for you.
All politics is personal.
You of all people know that.
And you want her dead, too.
And neither one of us can do it alone.
You'll come to your senses soon.
You're no fool.
You want to protect what he left you?
It's the only way.
Congratulations on the ruling coming out of the court.
They still haven't decided.
But we all know how it's going to go.
Please, sit down.
Nora Cafferty...
has a secret.
Excuse me.
I assume you were worried about the scare with the baby.
I spoke to President Petrov.
He's informed me that
ICO is trying to acquire a nuclear device.
Yes. They are.
So why didn't you tell me?
I have full confidence in you, Nora,
and your abilities, but this concerns me.
You cannot under any circumstances
withhold information that is essential to our national security.
I had such high hopes for you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to have to say this.
I was hoping the Supreme Court would rule against you.
That they would take away the football.
And I'm not the only one who's starting to feel it.
This is my house, and I want you out.
She's ready to condemn her husband.
So why aren't you?
It wasn't a thief who killed Tom.
No.
I don't think it was.
Look, Tom and I were working on  
Okay, I know what he was working on.
It took me almost a month to find it,
but it was on his dog's collar.
It was the same thing
Lucas was working on and Zoe before that.
Always with the same problem,
no one will believe it.
  Look, I laid it out for him     Without any evidence.
Or do you have any?
All there is, is your word.
And what is that even worth these days?
I mean, what the hell are you protecting?
I can keep driving. I don't mind.
Or you can help me finish the story of Tom, Lucas,
Zoe, you and...
maybe me.
I tested you.
And you passed.
That's basically how I see it, Madam President.
You're impertinent.
That was clear from the start.
No, I'm ambitious.
Which is something that I've always admired,
from afar, about you.
Even when you were attacking me?
Forgive me. I become aggressive when I'm nervous.
It's always been that way.
Can we start over?
Because I think I finally understand you
and what you're trying to do for this country.
I can help you get your message out.
Sure.
  All right, settle, people.   Okay, let's begin.
Let's go in four, three, two  
First things first.
Despite what the odds-makers have decided,
I am going to be the mother of a baby girl.
  Congratulations.   Thank you.
And have you picked out a name?
Um, not yet.
I need to see her face first.
What do you most wish the American people knew about you?
Something surprising.
That I like nothing more than to laugh.
And what does the prospect of becoming a mother,
while being the leader of the free world, feel like?
Bittersweet.
I didn't expect to deliver Francis' child as a widow, of course.
But I have things to do for my unborn child,
for this unformed nation.
I want to create a progressive and productive Hale legacy
for the ages.
Speaking of which.
Why did you return to your maiden name?
Well, I think your question answered itself.
Maiden name.
The assumptions behind that expression
led me back to what I can only call my name.
President Hale,
why the delay in nominating a replacement
for the vice presidential vacancy?
Two reasons. One, constitutionally,
Congress needs to confirm the choice
and our current Congress is dirty.
We'll have to see what happens with the midterms.
And two, if I've learned anything from partnerships,
you have to choose someone who'd take a bullet for you.
And, Melody, I'd like to come clean on something.
Please.
The truth is, and it pains me to say this,
but the truth is, this country
never got to know the real Francis Underwood.
I'm not sure I ever really knew him myself.
I know you saw it, too.
He was impossible to know, like all con men.
He played us all.
Come and get me, Doug.
She leaves me no choice.
 Row, row, row your boat 
 Gently down the stream 
 Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily 
 Life is but a dream 
 Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream 
 If you see a crocodile 
 Don't forget to scream House.of.Cards.SE
I am here to talk about the future.
And the future has become very personal.
What are you talking about?
It's where Rachel Posner is buried.
There are two kinds of pain.
Doug Stamper sent me that text,
he said it comes from your husband's diary.
who should I interview, you or him?
You're  weeks pregnant, Madam President.
You fucking cunt. It's a girl.
After her death, with the vice presidency vacant,
our friend Brett Cole will be president.
We'll make her a martyr.
I don't care about you or what you want.
But you do care what Frank wanted.
Frank wanted her dead.
I'm coming for you, Claire.
What would Frank do?
Given that she's carrying his child.
I've always promised to tell you the truth.
Transparency is the cornerstone of my presidency.
And in that spirit,
I feel compelled to share the following.
For some weeks now,
the Justice Department has been investigating allegations
that the former president, my husband,
falsely inflated  election day dangers in several states
that may have played a role in tipping the results.
This news, as you can imagine,
has caused a widow's dark night of the soul.
Madam President!
This used to be my office.
That was my desk.
The couch is different,
but I slept here more nights than I care to remember.
Congressman Underwood's desk was right through there.
He never slept.
Never button the bottom.
  Madam President!   Sarah, yes.
Ma'am, to follow up.
What specific action, if any, are you planning to take,
since your husband is...
Dead.
Well, everything is on the table.
Up to and including a posthumous indictment.
  Larry.   But, Madam President,
if you're calling the election results into question,
what does that mean for your presidency?
This is the highest office in the land.
Public service is a sacred privilege,
and no one is above the law.
Not the father of my child, not me.
Marcus.
Were you given any warning about this article that just came out?
By Janine Skorsky?
I don't know what you're referring to.
It was posted as you were speaking.
The headline reads,
"Former President Underwood excluded his wife from his will."
Would you care to comment?
Well, I can't comment on what I haven't seen. Thank you.
The source named in the piece is Douglas Stamper.
I have known Douglas
since he became my husband's right hand man over  years ago.
And it is no secret that he's been having a difficult time lately.
Emotionally, above all else.
And when I pardoned him months ago, it was based on compassion.
I feel for the man, I do.
But Doug Stamper will never be the one to lead us to the truth.
"The former president apparently handwrote an th hour will,
technically known as a holographic will,
with instructions that his entire estate
be left to his former Chief of Staff Douglas Stamper."
Does it say anything about what's in it?
"The specifics of the will are not yet public,
but in an exclusive interview with Mr. Stamper,
he promised to reveal the contents 'soon.'"
That'll be all for now.
Get White House counsel.
No, no, actually getmy personal lawyer on the phone now.
Yes, ma'am. And Assistant Director Green is here,
but he insisted that his  
Madam President.
Let me introduce you to my wife Abby and this is our son Jackson.
Hello.
Abby's such a fan, we were hoping to take a picture.
Of course.
I wanted my family here with me when I let you know,
I'm leaving the Bureau.
I already submitted my letter of resignation.
Nathan, we can't possibly accept that.
Please, President Hale. I'm begging you.
Lynn, can you come in here, please?
Nathan, I insist we speak about this one-on-one.
Can you give us a moment?
I'm sorry I failed you as far as the desert,
but I can't do this anymore.
  Nathan     I've made up my mind.
It's better for both of us if I go quietly.
I'm sure you're looking forwardto walking Jackson
to his first day of school.
I am, ma'am.
Well, my feelings haven't changed.
I want Doug to finally, finally get the help
he so desperately needs.
You're right to be concerned.
There are some crazy people out there.
In my last conversation with Doug,
he told me entities had approached him,
hoping to recruit him. Abby.
You should cancel your upcoming public appearances.
  Here to see an old friend.   The president said,
 "Doug Stamper will never be the one to lead us to the truth."
You care to comment?
It must serve the president to paint me as some sort of crazy man.
Bu I'm sorry to disappoint her, I am of right mind, and she knows it.
In terms of a revised will, who knows about its contents?
Why don't you ask her that question?
Sir, how did you become aware of it?
I was with him the night he died.
He asked me to his suite at the Hay-Adams.
He told me he no longer had faith
in his wife's ability to serve as president.
And President Underwood,
the real President Underwood, kept an audio diary.
Pieces of which I've heard.
Then let's find a court that will rule in our favor.
...Stamper, former Chief of Staff to President Francis Underwood,
recorded earlier today.
Let's turn to our panel
for their take on the claim that the leak  
...remember, this is a troubled man.
We can't take everything he says at face value, right?
The question is, what is Stamper's endgame here?
  Why the whole attack on President Hale...   What?
He was supposed to provoke her.
He walked away from murder charges.
  Don't forget that...   Mark...
  I don't have time to read your mind.   I tried to warn you.
I've worked with this guy. We could be exposed.
  Do you trust me, my instincts     Yes, of course I do.
That has nothing to do with evaluating the risk he is becoming.
He's unhinged, Annette.
Unhinged is what's called for.
Contain him. That's your job.
Annette!
What's going on?
If my son were anyone else in this country, he'd be out by now.
No, what's going on here?
Between us?
We're having sex again.
Until it seems like a bad idea, again.
  Hey, listen to me     That bitch
is tipping the scales when it comes to Duncan.
And there's no way he can get a fair hearing,
until she's gone.
Okay, hold on. Just, um...
Can you back up a few words?
How far back?
"Moments like this require..."
What is it?
"Someone who will act. Who will do the unpleasant thing."
You know what? Can you just let me hear it?
No.
Why not?
I can't. It's...
What are you doing?
Nothing, I   Nothing.
Look, we don't have to go ahead with this. Okay?
And whatever you need to figure out, you should.
Like, can't you just leave him alone?
  What do you think I am?   Look, I know exactly what you are.
She's gonna come after you.
"Requires someone who will act.
Who will do the unpleasant thing, the necessary thing.
Don't be fooled by her beautiful face.
My wife is ruthless."
"The most ruthless woman I've ever met.If people only knew."
We've filed an injunction.
But Skorsky's saying her source
believes the material belongs to him.
This is insane.
Unless someone produces evidence of a will, there's no  
Why are we even taking this seriously?
I am confident I can silence her with a gag order.
But once a thing is in print,
  any other news outlet has the right to     Print?
This isn't print, Geraldine.
Can't we just shut down the site?
No, ma'am. I don't think we can.
My advice, let's depose.
Get Mr. Stamper under oath.
  If he perjures himself     No. That's exactly what he wants.
He wants a public forum.
And he's been through enough already.
Madam President, I have to ask.
And I will ask you this in front of your attorney.
Is it your position
that you were entirely unaware of your husband's  
  You don't have to answer that.   No, no, I want to.
I don't know if he did it for his sake or mine,
but he never told me a thing.
Ma'am, in United States v. Nixon  
I swear on his unborn child.
Well, there's no doubt that there's areas of the company
she's not quite as well versed in.
Partly my fault, our  
Our father didn't believe in succession.
Are you saying you don't think your sister deserves  
No. That's not what I'm saying.
If anything, when I talk about succession,
I'm talking about this presidency.
Let's face it, our Commander In Chief,
who basically inherited the job from her husband,
is acting like a goddamn monarch.
When  
When a tyrant pretends to be transparent,
nation beware.
And these  
These comments,
these public comments from Doug Stamper make nothing but sense.
I mean, follow the complicity.
  So, do you have any advice for President Hale?   Yes.
Abdicate.
  Oh. Come on now, Bill.   No, no. Listen
it wouldn't be the worst thing for this country
if she didn't finish out her term.
If that's what was fated for her.
  Mr. Shepard     Listen,
I was flipping around the channels last night,
and I came across The Alamo.
I know it's not a great movie,
but when John Wayne chokes up saying "Republic  
Bill Shepherd, shut the fuck up.
Reach out to the others.
Remind them of the perils of loose lips.
Nathan Green was in a meeting hosted by Annette Shepherd.
I don't get rattled easily,
but the secrecy around this one, who was there and why,
is more than I have ever come across.
I suspect there were some very powerful people in that room.
Douglas Stamper?
I don't know yet.
Anything else?
Walter, you have worked with us from the beginning.
Yes. I liked Frank.
So, I'm curious.
How did you pull it off?
Oh, Claire,
my calling is a practical one.
I don't judge. I don't question.
I simply work for the highest bidder.
I'm agnostic, but this virtual landscape is new to me.
And someone out there
is working very hard to make Frank look very bad.
Listen, it's just a lot of noise at the moment.
It's not only about him.
How will you manage to separate yourself from all this shit?
All that's left is Doug to connect me.
Be careful, Claire.
Oh, you guys.
I really didn't wanna have to have to do this, but...
An extreme faction of the ICO terrorist group
made an attempt to purchase a nuclear device in Pakistan.
That's a fact.
  Madam President, all due respect     Maria,
I know you're new to this,
but please don't ever use that expression with me.
"All due respect" means precisely the opposite.
Ma'am, it's just that this threat
remains squarely in the category of a potential  
The intent is there.
Until we have confirmation that the deal has  
Our intelligence has told us
that they will regroup and try again.
This goes back to the warning from Rafiq Nasser two months ago.
Now acting Secretary Gallagher and I
have been keeping a close watch on this threat
ever since Nancy took over for Nora at Homeland.
And in the spirit of the full transparency
this administration is embracing,
we're going to take it public.
Ma'am. Frankly, I'm concerned.
From a strategic perspective,
if ICO doesn't act, we appear to be crying wolf.
But on the other hand, are we putting ourselves in a position
where we're daring them to act?
We don't want to appear reckless.
I couldn't sleep last night.
For obvious national security reasons, of course,
but...
also because the baby kept me awake.
And for some reason...
the word "misogynist" popped into my mind.
And I was trying to think of the word for the opposite.
You know, the word for when a personhates men.
Does anyone around this table know that word is?
The word for when a person hates men?
Anybody?
I had to go and look it up.
"Misandrist."
And no one really knows that word
because it's not used in our culture.
So what I'm getting at, is maybe we all,
regardless of our gender,
would do well to examine the pre-conceived notions that we have
about who can and cannotact as Commander In Chief.
There you go.
They're from a place called the Federalist Pig.
I don't know it.
Well, I've been told it is the next best thing to Freddy's.
I'm good. You want some?
No, they're for you.
Doyle has been asking around about you.
Now we can shut him down.
But...
Yeah, come on, give me one. I mean...
What kind of man says no to ribs, right?
The articles and the press conferences.
A little goes a long way, Doug.
A lot of people,
in a way, the whole country,
  we're relying on you.   Seth,
I can take care of myself.
Can you pass that sauce?
You must be so alone.
Do you even have anyone around anymore that you can trust?
What are you playing at?
"Surely, she saw it all. The killing.
The lying," Says Frank at minute six.
Doug, you and me have to have a come to Jesus.
Agreed. Stop publicly accusing him or it's all gonna come down.
All I'm trying to do is seek the truth these days.
Minute    "Before I ever made any big moves,
I always ran them by my wife."
I like the sound of your voice, Doug. It's so soothing.
I never really thought about it before,
but in just this way, you remind me of Francis.
The one thing I really miss is his voice.
It was always my favorite thing about him.
No matter what he would say,
the sound of his voice made me feel like
everything was going to be all right.
It's not.
Besides Annette, who else was there?
I'm the only one who can save you, Doug.
"And then he asked if I had no faith in God.
I said, 'You have it wrong.
It's God who has no faith in us.'"
Minute . Would you like me to play it for you?
Drop the investigation and apologize for what you're doing to him
or more of this is gonna come out.
I'm gonna press play. I want you to hear it.
My security team just informed me
that Russian soldiers are firing at American Special Forces, Viktor.
They invaded the coast,
which violates agreements you and I made.
Preventing a nuclear device from  
Did you orchestrate this, Claire?
For what? To distract from your husband's diary?
And don't act like that would be beneath you.
I don't believe motherhood automatically makes a woman a saint.
  Rafiq Nasser     Is dead.
We hit him with a drone strike an hour ago.
He was providing us with necessary intelligence.
That you provided him with first.
The threat is real.
I'll have my people, the GRU, take it from here.
No, you won't.
Look, Claire, just...
worry about having your baby now.
I've always been entertained by your arrogance.
It's like watching some movie, just out of date.
If a rogue element gets their hands on a nuclear device, Viktor,
I will strike first.
What time is it there now?
Must be close to sunrise, huh?
Just about.
If you drop an atom bomb,
our world, your daughter's world...
That sun will never look the same again, Claire.
What time is it there?
I'm about to have lunch.
And what are you having?
Oh, a salad.
Cucumbers and tomatoes, a bit of feta.
Some Spanish olive oil and herbs from Tangiers.
I don't eat bread anymore, you know.
We never had a proper meal, you and I.
Not really.
I'll have to oppose you now, openly at the UN.
And at every turn.
Privately, I...
I will miss you.
As I made clear to President Petrov,
I will not have terrorists waltzing out of the desert
with an atomic bomb.
It's time for me to treat you all like the adults you are.
The truth is...
I'm not the only one who's in danger.
No one's safe. Not really.
Not ever.
Does that mean a nuclear strike? The first one since Nagasaki?
If need be, yes.
Terry.
You've become a vocal critic of the president.
Even before your arrest.
Actually, the first time you went public
was to support legislation limiting her powers.
Which is now more urgent than ever.
And recently, as you await trial,
you got into some more hot water with your comments.
Yes, I misspoke.
But let's face it. This president is fatal.
I mean, she's out there evoking end of days.
And with her in office,
that is exactly where this country is headed.
And what am I?
Some antiquated soul because I still believe in family?
Listen, if you want to do something in this country about poverty,
family.
Crime, family.
Education, family. It's family.
My parents had dinner at six o'clock. Every single night.
They didn't care where you were, what the hell you were doing.
Dinner was at six, goddamnit.
And when's the last time you and your sister had dinner?
That is a fair question.
And it has been some time
since we sat across from each other.
How you doing, Bill?
Depends on the day.
And the dose.
I brought you some pastries, from Poupon, Georgetown.
I know you have a soft spot for those.
Well, I don't do sugar anymore.
It's... fuel for the tumor.
You can have one, if you want.
No, I'm good.
Twenty years ago,
I probably would have sat down...
and written out my memoirs,
instead of...
trying to just get it out there any way I can.
I thought she would have come out.
I'm sorry. She sent me.
Does she want me to stop?
The opposite.
She wants you to keep hitting the president hard...
so that she can come out against you.
Is this gonna be a mess?
Could be.
When did it happen?
That we were the ones catching up.
Were we not paying attention?
Not enough.
Francis was a son of a bitch.
But he was a talented son of a bitch.
He saw her coming.
He just couldn't stop himself.
Or her.
Where do you think we're gonna be in ten years, Mark?
Come on. I'm asking everybody.
  For obvious reasons.   You think about it more than I do.
Fat, wasted and distracted.
Might be a good night out, but it's no way to live a life.
Come on, ten years?
I don't know.
Things don't really change, Bill.
They just  
They just fade away, man.
God, I'm angry.
I heard your husband's voice.
Douglas Stamper came to us.
Offered up Francis' diaries,
snippets of which Doug played for me.
And to tell you the truth, I considered using it against you.
But I don't think it should
ever find its way into the public sphere.
  Forgive my surprise.   I'm not my brother.
Bill's become bad for democracy.
Like Francis was.
The world loves a cat fight,
but I say let's deny them the satisfaction.
It's not too late for us.
You know, you're right. Let's not give themwhat they want.
Fuck them all.
Sorry, Angel.
They hear things, you know. There have been studies.
Is it amazing?
It is.
She's an active little thing.
May I?
Sure.
She's kicking.
We'll take care of Doug.
I don't believe your support.
You're a bad liar, Annie.
And you tried to kill her.
You have my son.
How are you gonna do it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Tell me who the others are and I will let Duncan go.
  He's innocent, as am I.   God, please.
This so-called nuclear crisis.
You're worse than Frank.
She's kicking again.
It's like she senses we're nearing the end.
The only question, Doug, is
if you're their plan A, what's their plan B?
If Francis were here, we'd know.
Yes. Well, if he was going to kill me,
  how would he do it?   He'd find an opportunity you provided.
He was always three steps ahead, wasn't he?
Francis Underwood...
Maybe he still is.
Have I been keeping him alive?
Just how far am I willing to go?
I'm having second thoughts.
Am I sure this is a good idea?
Yes.
What if I'm carrying a demon seed or something?
The odds are  .
So tired of talking about Francis.
I miss my boyfriend Reed.
I do too, sometimes, but  
Reed wanted too much.
Francis gave me permission to hunger.
Because he felt it himself.
All the time. Insatiable.
Everyone thinks I should feel sated.
Then he said, "No, Claire,
be as hungry as me."
And so I ate him?
He ate himself.
Doug Stamper?
Am I going to eat him?
  Herr God.   Herr Lucifer.,
Beware.
You know, I always thought...
  maybe one day, you know, but...   Put it back.
What?
The picture. It belongs on the fridge.
Okay, sorry.
You know, if there is anythingthat I can do.
I mean, in case it doesn't go as planned.
Can you please stop moving?
I'm a little worked up, all right?
Claire Hale Underwood lived and then she died.
  She's no different from anyone else.   Yeah.
Well, I'm not sure the world's gonna see it the way you do.
If this breaks right, you can be a hero.
Don't spin me, Seth.
How do they plan to do me in?
Seth?
Look.
I'm gonna say this to you.
Not because we're friends.
But because of everything that we've been through together.
You're an asshole.
You don't have to be a part of this, if you don't want to.
You saying that for me or for you?
Maybe both.
I don't know who it is...
but they have someone inside the White House.
Military always hated her.
That's one thing.
Fuck 'em all.
What about the two of us? We just leave.
Where do you wanna go?
Hello.
How does he look?
He's fine. He's sure that she'll invite him in.
Put him on.
Doug.
Yeah.
What extraordinary times these are.
I wish I could be there to shake your hand.
Annette, I want to make something very clear.
I'm not doing this for you.
We'll be sure to move him from Gaffney to Arlington.
And help fund the Library.
And, Doug, given your recent struggles,
nine or ten years from now, you could be out.
And I want to thank you.
Seth.
Yes.
Everything is set from our side.
The quarterback is standing by.
And Duncan?
Is going to have to wait.
What else did she say?
Nothing.
Just...
everything's in place.
Later.
Seth.
It's not going to go like you think.
No.
I never liked talking to you in the first place.
From what I hear,
you were right to cancel your public appearances.
  You think so?   I do, ma'am.
I think the White Houseis the safest place
for you to be right now.
Nathan, you're a liar.
Do me a favor. Kiss your sweet baby's forehead for me.
Our intelligence confirms
the hand off is on the verge of taking place.
And our intelligence says that's not so.
We're talking about a  mile radius of sand.
Unreachable by conventional means.
I'll have my forces coordinate with yours, okay?
I'm not asking for your permission, Viktor.
Look, Claire. I can see how eager you are to show your enemies
just how powerful you are.
But, please,
please don't do this.
I know you,
the things you've done.
Think how the world will judge you.
As if you have any credibility with the world stage.
Prepare a statement.
Ma'am, I need to object.
Pardon me?
The public is aware we're prepared to strike.
We don't need to alarm them further.
I will not be a part of this... this fabrication.
Alert the military aide.
I want him ready and waiting with the briefcase.
A targeted strike will destabilize the region
for decades to come...
and it will create a distrust
that will ripple through Europe and much of Asia.
Markets will be rocked. Yes, the consequences will be grave.
But it has come to my attention...
that there is a plot against me.
Someone in my White House is planning to betray me.
And until I find out who that is,
I will not reconsider my position here.
Ma'am? Something arrived for you from Doug Stamper.
It was passed through security.
Thank you.
Yes.
The men in uniform don't support you.
I want the White House emptied out.
Other than yourselves, minimal and essential staff only.
  All visitors need to be cleared by me.   Yes, ma'am.
Are you fucking kidding me? Are you standing me up?
God bless you, man.
But this is not what you promised me.
And you can tell the president
that she can send an army of lawyers at me,
but I won't be buried.
I am not going to stop.
And I don't know when it will be or how.
But I am going to finish this godforsaken story, okay?
See, the Harry Brooker painting, that's my very favorite.
And then there's the Hogarth.
That's 's, English.
And from France, the Chardin, same period.
Maison des Cartes.
There's...
one from the s from Germany
that's very interesting in here.
There, see?
They all have one thing in common.
Children watching,
waiting for the cards to fall.
Seth Grayson.
Annette.
I won't be here for this.
Where would you rather be?
I don't know.
Tenants Advocacy Group, south side of Chicago.
But I can't be there, so I don't know.
If you're leaving, leave.
Ma'am.
Thank you, Colonel Flora.
What did they promise you?
  Ma'am, I didn't     Quiet.
What took you so long?
May we have the room, please?
  Are you sure, ma'am?   Yes. It's all right. Thank you.
Doug.
Do we need a drink?
You can't.
Well, desperate times, right?
Here's who wants you dead.
Annette Shepherd had me waiting.
I know who was there.
Thank you.
Whatever happens here...
It's between us.
Doug, I know you. You've never really had anyone else.
Rachel Posner, but...
How long do you think you're going to get away with that?
I don't.
What are you going to call her?
I haven't decided yet.
  What do you think?   Frances Underwood.
Frances with an "E."
That belongs to her.
She ever gonna get to hear his voice? His words?
No.
And neither is anyone else.
  Her father was a great man, Claire.   Doug.
How many times did he even mention your name
in those recordings?
  He was protecting me.   No.
I'm so sorry you need to believe that.
Do you want it?
I'm the only one left who knows you, Claire.
You're using that child out there,
acting like the mother of this nation.
  I know the truth.   Doug, I'm happy.
Believe me. I'm good.
I want you to know that I forgive you.
It was you, right?
He was coming here to kill you.
And then he was going to go to you next.
I couldn't let you destroy him.
Did you want him to die in my bed? Was that your plan?
I didn't have a plan.
I didn't know.
Ididn't   I didn't know.
I used his meds.
I didn't know how long it would take, but I  
I knew.
I couldn't let him destroy everything we built.
I had to protect the legacy from the man.
He got weak, Doug.
That wasn't your fault.
He made you!
Say it. Say it.
Say it.
I'm not going to give you what you want.
Damn it, Claire. Just say it. Please.
You're happy he's dead, too.
Then say it! Say it!
Say it!
Say it right now.
Let him go, Doug.
I can't!
I'm sorry.
I'm sor  
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
It's all right, Doug.
Everything is gonna be all right.
It's all gonna be all right.
There.
No more pain.
