It is raining today. So Peppa and George cannot play outside.

Daddy, it's stopped raining.

Can we go out to play?

All right, run along you two.

Peppa loves jumping in muddy puddles.

I love muddy puddles.

Peppa! If you jump in muddy puddles, you must wear your boots.

Sorry, Mummy.

George likes to jump in muddy puddles, too.

George. If you jump in muddy puddles, you must wear your boots.

Peppa likes to look after her little brother, George.

George, let's find some more puddles.

Peppa and George are having a lot of fun.

Peppa has found a little puddle.

George has found a big puddle.

Look, George. There's a really big puddle.

George wants to jump into the big puddle first.

Stop, George.

I must check if it's safe for you.

Good. It is safe for you.

Sorry, George. It's only mud.

Peppa and George love jumping in muddy puddles.

Come on, George.

Let's go and show Daddy.

Goodness me.

Daddy. Daddy.


Guess what we've been doing.

Let me think...

Have you been watching television?

No. No. Daddy.

Have you just had a bath?

No. No.

I know. You've been jumping in muddy puddles.

Yes. Yes. Daddy. We've been jumping in muddy puddles.

Ho. Ho. And look at the mess you're in.

Ooh...

Oh, well, it's only mud.

Let's clean up quickly before Mummy sees the mess.

Daddy, when we've cleaned up, will you and Mummy come and play, too?

Yes, we can all play in the garden.

Peppa and George are wearing their boots.

Mummy and Daddy are wearing their boots.

Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Oh, Daddy Pig, look at the mess you're in.

It's only mud.



George's favourite toy is Mr Dinosaur.

Dinosaur!

George loves Mr Dinosaur.

Grrr!



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mr Dinosaur is Lost



Sometimes, George likes to scare Peppa with Mr Dinosaur.

Grrr!

Eek! Too scary.

At suppertime, Mr Dinosaur sits next to George.

I beg your pardon.

Was that you George, or was it Mr Dinosaur?

Dinosaur!

At bath time, George shares his bath with Mr Dinosaur.

Grrr!

Good night, Peppa.

Good night, Mummy.

Good night, George.

And good night, Mr Dinosaur.

Grrr!

When George goes to bed, Mr Dinosaur is tucked up with him.

George's favourite game is throwing Mr Dinosaur up in the air...

Whee!

...and catching him when he falls back down.

Whee!

Peppa and Daddy Pig are playing draughts.

I win, Daddy.

Oh. Well done, Peppa.

Whaaaaaaaa!

George?

Whaaaaaaaa!

George, what's the matter?

Dinosaur.

George, have you lost Mr Dinosaur?


George has lost Mr Dinosaur.

Don't worry, George. We'll find Mr Dinosaur.

It's a job for a detective.

Daddy, what is a detective?

A detective is a very important person who is good at finding things.

Me! Me! I'm good at finding things.

All right. Peppa is the detective.

George. I am the detective. I will help you find Mr Dinosaur.

Maybe the detective should ask George some simple questions.

George, where's Mr Dinosaur?

Whaaaaaaaa!

George does not know where Mr Dinosaur is.

The detective could try and guess where Mr Dinosaur might be.

I know. I know where he is.

George always has Mr Dinosaur with him in the bath.

So Mr Dinosaur is in the bath.

Mr Dinosaur is not in the bath.

Oh. I know. I know where Mr Dinosaur is.

George always has Mr Dinosaur in his bed at night.

So that's where he is.

Mr Dinosaur is not in George's bed.

Oh.

Maybe we should try the garden.

Yes, the garden. I was going to say that.

Where is Mr Dinosaur?

Mr Dinosaur is very hard to find.

Oh. Mr Dinosaur isn't anywhere.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Best Friend



George? You do love to throw Mr Dinosaur in the air.

I wonder if this time you threw Mr Dinosaur just a bit too high.

There he is. There he is. I saw him first.

Well done, Peppa.

You really are a very good detective.

Dinosaur. Grrr!

George is so happy to have Mr Dinosaur back again.

Whee!

Maybe it isn't a good idea to play with dinosaurs near trees.

Dinosaur!



Peppa is waiting for her best friend, Suzy Sheep.

Hello, Suzy.

Hello, Peppa.

Suzy Sheep has come to play with Peppa.

Peppa loves Suzy. Suzy loves Peppa. They are best friends.

Peppa, why don't you and Suzy go and play in your bedroom?

Yes, Mummy.

George wants to play, too.

Peppa and Suzy love playing in Peppa's bedroom.

So does George.

No, George. This game is just for big girls.

Go and play with your own toys.

Peppa and Suzy want to play on their own.

I'm a tiny little fairy princess.


I'm going to wave my magic wand, and turn you into a frog!

George doesn't like playing on his own.

George wants to play, too.

No, George! I'm playing with Suzy.

You'll have to play somewhere else.

George wants to play with Peppa. He feels a bit lonely.

George, I need some help! I'm making chocolate chip cookies.

Someone needs to lick out the bowl.

George likes helping Mummy make cookies. But he likes playing with Peppa more.

I want to be a nurse.

I want to be a doctor.

But who's going to be the sick person?

George!

Peppa and Suzy love playing doctors and nurses.

So does George.

Peppa listens to George's chest.

Now, George, take a big breath in, then cough.

Hmm, I think your heart's a bit loose. I'll put a plaster on it.

Open wide, please.

Suzy takes George's temperature.

Oh dear, you're very very hot.

I think you have to stay in bed for three years.

Daddy Pig has come to find George.

Oh, no! What's wrong with George?

Don't worry, Daddy. It's only a game.

George is our patient.

Oh, I see.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Polly Parrot



Can the patient have a visitor?

Just for a little while.

He might get tired.

Cookies!

Yes, they're for George. They're his medicine to make him feel better.

Um, excuse me, doctor. Can you help me? I have a sore tummy.

That tickles!

I can hear it rumbling.

I think you're hungry, Daddy.

Then I think I need lots of cookies to make me better.

And me!

And me!

And me!



Peppa and her family are visiting Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig.

Granny Pig! Grandpa Pig!

Ganny 'ig! Baba 'ig!

Hello, my little ones. Come inside. We have a surprise.

What is it?

We have a new pet. Can you guess what it is?

Dinosaur?

No. It's not a dinosaur. Come and see.

Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig have a pet parrot.

Peppa, George, this is our pet parrot. She's called Polly. Pretty Polly.

Pretty Polly.

Wow!


I am a clever parrot.

I am a clever parrot.

Mummy, why does Polly copy everything that Granny says?

That's what parrots do. I'll show you.

Hello, Polly.

Hello, Polly.

What a sweet little parrot!

What a sweet little parrot!

Come on, everyone. Tea time!

Peppa, George, come on. There's chocolate cake!

Coming, Granny.

Peppa and George love eating chocolate cake. But today, they're in a hurry to get back and play with Polly Parrot.

Finished!

What noisy little ones you are!

Granny, please can we leave the table and go and see Polly Parrot?

Are you sure you've completely finished your cake?

Off you go, then.

Hurray!

George, say something to Polly.

George is a little bit shy.

Hello.

Hello.

Peppa and George are really enjoying playing with Polly Parrot.

I'm Peppa Pig!

I'm Peppa Pig!

George, say something.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Hide and Seek



Oink.

Oink.

Peppa and George are pretending to be parrots.

I'm Polly Parrot.

Peppa is thinking of something else to say to Polly Parrot.

I'm a noisy parrot. Oink!

I'm a noisy parrot. Oink!

Peppa, George, have you been playing with Polly?

Yes, Granny.

Polly is such a sweet parrot.

Yes, Granny.

I'm a clever parrot.

I'm a noisy parrot. Oink! I'm a noisy parrot. Oink!

Oh!

Oh, my word!



Peppa and George are playing hide and seek.

It is George's turn to hide.

He must quickly find somewhere to hide before Peppa finishes counting.

One... two... three... four... five... six... seven...

George has found somewhere to hide.

Eight...

Just in time.

Nine... ten...

Ready or not, here I come.

Peppa has to find where George is hiding.

Found you.

Peppa has found George.


George, I could see you too easily.

Now it is Peppa's turn to hide.

One... um... three.

I'll help George to count.

One... two... three... four... five... six...

seven... eight... nine... ten.

Okay, George, open your eyes.

George has to find where Peppa is hiding.

Oh.

Peppa isn't hiding under the table.

George, have you thought of looking upstairs?

Peppa isn't under the bed.

What was that strange noise?

Peppa isn't behind the curtain.

There is that strange noise again.

What can it be?

Whee!

George has found where Peppa was hiding.

George found me.

Now it's Daddy's turn to hide.

Oh, I think George should have another turn.

But George isn't very good at hiding.

I'm sure he'll be better this time.

Close your eyes and start counting.

One... two... three...

Oh dear, Peppa will easily find George.

Four... five... six...

George, come over here.

Seven... eight... nine... ten.

Ready or not, here I come.

Oh, George isn't hiding under the table.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Playgroup



But George always hides under the table.

Have you thought of looking upstairs?

I know where he is.

George is in the toy basket.

Oh.

George is not in the toy basket.

Where can he be?

Peppa can not find George anywhere.

Daddy, I can't find George anywhere.

Oh dear, I wonder where he can be.

Actually, I think there's something about George in this newspaper.

Whee...

George. Found you.

Oh, George. That was a good place to hide.

George was hiding behind Daddy Pig's newspaper all the time.



Peppa and George are going to the playgroup. It is George's first day.

George, are you looking forward to the playgroup?

Oink, oink.

Daddy, maybe George is too small to go to my playgroup?

He'll be fine, Peppa. There'll be you and Mr Dinosaur there to keep him company.

Grrr! Dinosaur.

But I want to play with the big children, not George and his toy dinosaur.

Oh dear, Peppa doesn't want George to go to her playgroup.


We're here.

Daddy, are you sure George is big enough?

He'll be fine.

All right, he can come.

Bye bye.

Madame Gazelle looks after the children at the playgroup.

Hello. This is my little brother, George.

Hello, George.

I wish I had a little brother like George.

Really?

Hello! I'm Danny Dog. Woof woof! Is that a dinosaur?

It's just a toy dinosaur.

Grrr! Dinosaur.

Brilliant. Woof woof!

Dinosaur. Grrr!

Ah!

Dinosaur. Grrr!

Ah! Really scary.

That's brilliant.

George is my brother. He's brilliant.

Peppa is proud of her little brother George.

Shall we show George how we paint pictures?

George is not very good at painting.

Well, maybe you could help him?

Yes, I'm very good. I will show him how to paint a flower.

George, today I'm going to teach you how to paint a flower.

Oink oink.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mummy Pig at Work



First you paint a big circle.

No, George. That's the wrong colour.

Now you paint the flower's petals.

George! That's the wrong shape.

Now you paint the stalk and the leaves.

Perfect.

George, you've done it all wrong.

Now what do we have here?

I've painted a flower.

That's very good, Peppa. And George has painted a dinosaur.

Grrr! Dinosaur.

Woof! Brilliant.

I think George and Peppa's pictures should go on the wall.

Hurray!

Peppa, you must be very proud of your little brother.

Yes, I am.

It is home time and the children's parents are here to pick them up.

Can George come next time?

Yes, and he can paint us another lovely picture. And what will you paint next time, George?

Dinosaur. Grrr!

Another dinosaur picture? Well, maybe you can show us all how to paint a dinosaur.

Oink oink!

Woof! Brilliant.

Yes! Brilliant.

Brilliant.



Mummy Pig is working on her computer. Daddy Pig is making soup for lunch.

Daddy, can we go and watch Mummy on her computer?

Yes, as long as you don't disturb her. She has a lot of important work to do today.

Thank you, Daddy.

Mummy Pig has a lot of important work to do.

Mummy, can George and I sit on your lap and watch you work?

Yes, if you both sit quietly.

Peppa and George love to watch Mummy work on the computer.

Mummy, can we play that computer game, Happy Mrs Chicken?

We can play Happy Mrs Chicken later. But now I have to work.

Mummy, can we help you work?

No, Peppa. You mustn't touch the computer.

And George, you mustn't touch the computer, either.

Yes, George, you mustn't do this.

Peppa, stop.

Sorry, Mummy. I was just showing George what not to do.

Oh, dear. The computer is not meant to do that.

Daddy Pig. Daddy Pig.

What is it, Mummy Pig?

Daddy Pig, can you mend the computer?

Uh...

I'll finish the lunch while you mend the computer.

Uh, right you are, Mummy Pig, but I'm not very good with these things.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Piggy in the Middle



Oh, thank you, Daddy Pig.

Daddy Pig is going to mend the computer.

Mmm... Mmm... Um, maybe if I just switch it off, and then switch it on again.

Daddy Pig has mended the computer.

Hurray, Daddy!

Yes, I am a bit of an expert at these things.

Daddy, can we play that computer game, Happy Mrs Chicken?

Maybe you should ask Mummy Pig.

Mummy said that we could play it later.

Well, that's okay then. But I don't know where the disc is.

Yippee!

Now it's my turn.

Now it's my turn.

What on earth is going on?

Well, I see the computer is working again.



George is playing with his ball in the garden.

Peppa wants to play, too.

George, you're doing it all wrong. This is how to catch a ball.

Not like this. That's what you do.

What a cheeky little one Peppa is.

George, come back! You little piggy!

Maybe Peppa is teasing George just a bit too much.

Peppa, have you been teasing George?

Not really, Mummy. I was teaching him how to catch.


Really? Oh, well, I know a game that will teach George how to catch. It's called Piggy in the Middle.

Peppa, you take the ball and stand over there. And George, you stand over there.

Good. You have to throw the ball to each other, and I have to try and catch it. I'm the piggy in the middle.

Mummy is the piggy in the middle. Catch, George.

Oh! Missed it.

George has caught the ball.

Hurray!

Well done, George. Now you throw the ball to Peppa.

Oop! Try again. Oh! Try again.

George can not throw the ball past Mummy Pig.

Come on, George. Give the ball to me.

Silly George. I can do that too.

Peppa wanted to copy George, but she's too big and has got stuck.

I've got the ball. Peppa, now it's your turn to be piggy. George, catch.

Hurray!

Caught it! George, you're the piggy. George, catch.

Catch the ball, George.

Catch, George.

George, catch.

Here's the ball, George. Whee!

Oh, dear. Peppa, you shouldn't tease George like that.

Sorry, George.

What's all the noise?

Daddy, George is too little to play Piggy in the Middle.

Oh, I'm sure he's big enough.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Daddy Loses His Glasses



No, he isn't. Daddy, watch!

Catch it, George.

Hurray!

That's not fair.

Yes, it is. I just gave George a helping hand.

Mummy, can I have a helping hand?

Of course you can, Peppa.

To me, George! Catch, George.

Peppa loves catching the ball. George loves catching the ball. Everyone loves catching the ball.


Daddy Pig wears glasses. He needs to wear glasses to see clearly. When Daddy Pig wears his glasses, everything looks fine. But when Daddy Pig takes his glasses off, he can't see things clearly. Everything looks a bit soft and fuzzy. So it is very important that Daddy Pig knows where his glasses are.

Sometimes Daddy Pig loses his glasses.

Peppa, George, have you seen Daddy Pig's glasses? He can't find them anywhere.

No, Mummy.

Peppa and George do not know where Daddy Pig's glasses are.

Oh, dear. Daddy Pig cannot see a thing without them. And it makes him very grumpy.

Without his glasses on, Daddy Pig cannot read his newspaper.

This is ridiculous. I can't see anything.

Somebody must have put my glasses somewhere.

Do you remember where you last put them, Daddy Pig?

When I don't wear them, I always put them in my pocket. But they aren't there now.

Daddy, can we help find your glasses?


Good idea, Peppa. If you find them, Daddy will stop being so grumpy.

I'm not grumpy.

Peppa and George are looking for Daddy's glasses.

Peppa looks under the newspaper. But Daddy Pig's glasses are not there.

Oh.

George looks on top of the television. But Daddy Pig's glasses are not there.

Oh.

Let's look upstairs in Mummy and Daddy's bedroom.

Peppa and George are looking in Mummy and Daddy Pig's bedroom.

George, be careful not to knock anything over.

Argh! It's not funny.

Peppa looks under the pillows. But Daddy Pig's glasses are not there.

Oh.

George looks in Daddy's slippers. But the glasses are not there, either.

Let's look in the bathroom.

Peppa and George are looking in the bathroom.

The glasses are not in the bath.

Oh.

The glasses are not in the toilet.

Oh.

Hmm! It's too difficult.

Peppa and George cannot find Daddy Pig's glasses anywhere.

We've looked everywhere. But we can't find Daddy's glasses.

Oh, dear. Now what can we do?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Gardening



I suppose I'll just have to learn to do without them. If I move slowly I won't bump into things.

There they are. Daddy's glasses.

Daddy Pig. You were sitting on them all the time.

Oh.

Silly Daddy.

I don't know how they got there.

I wonder how.

Well, you may have been a bit silly, Daddy Pig. But at least you're not grumpy anymore.

I was not grumpy.



Peppa and George are playing at Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig's house.

Grandpa, catch.

Ho ho ho ho. Catch.

What's this?

Dinosaur. Grrr!

A dinosaur? Ho ho ho ho.

Grandpa, what are you doing?

I'm planting these seeds.

Seeds? What do seeds do?

Seeds grow into plants.

I just make a little hole and put the seed in.

Then I cover it with earth and water it.

Everything in my garden grows from tiny seeds like these.

Even the big apple tree?

Oh, yes. This tiny seed will grow into a little apple tree, like this.

Ooh.


And that little apple tree will grow into a big apple tree like this.

Ouch! Mmm!

And inside this apple are more seeds.

To make more apple trees.

Exactly.

Grandpa, Grandpa! I want to plant a seed.

Would you like to plant a strawberry seed?

Yes, please.

This seed will grow into a lovely strawberry plant.

First, make a little hole.

Then I put the seed in and cover it with earth.

Shall I water it for you?

No, no! I want to water it.

Good. Now we wait for it to grow.

Peppa and George are waiting for the seed to grow.

It's not doing anything.

Ho ho ho ho ho. You'll have to be patient, Peppa. It will take a long time to grow.

Peppa! George! It's time to go home.

But we're waiting for my strawberry plant to grow.

I want these strawberries for tea.

Don't worry, Peppa. Next time you come, the seed will have grown into a plant.

And we will have strawberries!

Yes.

Come on, Peppa.

Bye bye, Grandpa. Bye bye, strawberry.

Grandpa Pig looks after Peppa's strawberry plant. After many days, Grandpa Pig finds a tiny plant growing. Day by day, the plant grows bigger and bigger. Then one day, Grandpa Pig finds something very special.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Hiccups



Strawberries!

Grandpa! We're back.

Peppa and George have come to play again.

Grandpa, Grandpa! Did my plant grow?

Yes! Look!

Ooh.

Strawberries!

Thank you, Grandpa.

Grandpa, can we plant something else?

Yes! Now it's George's turn to choose.

Yes! You choose, George. Choose a carrot.

Grandpa, I think George wants to grow a carrot.

George, would you like to grow a carrot?

No.

What would you like to grow?

George has thought of something he wants to grow.

Dinosaur.

George wants to grow a dinosaur tree.

Silly George. Dinosaurs don't grow on trees.

Dinosaur. Grrr!



Peppa, George, Mummy and Daddy are having breakfast. It is a lovely sunny day, and Peppa and George can't wait to go into the garden to play.

Mummy, please can we go out to play?

You can go out to play when you finish your breakfast.

George! Don't drink your juice too quickly.

George drank his juice too quickly, and now he has hiccups.


Can we go out to play now, Mummy?

Not while George has hiccups.

But George's hiccups have gone, Mummy. Haven't they, George?

Oh, all right, you can go out and play. But look after George.

Peppa and George love playing in the garden.

George, I'm going to throw the ball, and then you have to catch it.

George, please stop hiccupping.

George!

Now you throw the ball to me, and I have to catch it.

George!

Oh dear, George's hiccups are spoiling the game.

George, I know how to cure hiccups. You have to do what I say.

Rub the top of your head and rub your tummy.

Good. Now your hiccups have gone.

Peppa's cure for hiccups doesn't seem to have worked.

George, you've done it all wrong. I know a better way to cure hiccups. First, jump up and down three times on one leg.

Now wave your arms up and down and stick your tongue out.

And now, close your eyes, and turn around quickly three times.

Peppa's new cure hasn't worked, either. George still has hiccups.

I know. To cure hiccups, the ill piggy must be given a shock. George, I'm going to scare you. But you must remember, it's only a game and it will stop your hiccups.

Remember, this is just pretend scaring.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Bicycles



Peppa! You mustn't play so roughly with George. He's only little.

Sorry, Mummy. I was just trying to stop George's hiccups.

George's hiccups have gone.

Here comes Daddy Pig, with two beakers of juice.

George, if you drink too quickly, you will get hiccups again.

I'm not as little as George. I can drink juice as quickly as I want to.



It is a lovely sunny day, and Peppa and George are riding their bicycles.

That's a fine pumpkin, Daddy Pig.

Daddy Pig is very proud of his pumpkin.

Pumpkins are the only thing I can grow.

Probably because I love pumpkin pie.

Come on, George. Danny, Suzy, Rebecca!

Peppa and her friends, Danny Dog, Suzy Sheep and Rebecca Rabbit, are riding their bicycles. George is riding his tricycle.

He's going so slowly.

Let's race to Daddy Pig's pumpkin.

If we race to Daddy's pumpkin, we have to be very careful not to bump into it. Daddy would be very sad if the pumpkin got broken.

Don't worry, Peppa. Race you.

Peppa and her friends are racing to Daddy Pig's pumpkin.

Hey! Watch out for my pumpkin.

Hurray!

Peppa, look out! Daddy's pumpkin.

Sorry, Daddy.


Look at George. He's going so slowly. George is still riding a baby bike.

Yours is a baby bike too, Peppa. You've still got stabilizers.

I can ride without my stabilizers.

Me too.

And me.

Let's ride up the hill again. Are you coming, Peppa?

No, I think I'll stay here.

See you later.

Bye.

Peppa wishes she did not have stabilizers on her bicycle.

Daddy, I don't want stabilizers anymore.

Do you think you can ride without them?

Yes.

All right, Peppa. Let's take them off.

Daddy Pig is taking the stabilizers off Peppa's bicycle.

Are you sure you want to ride without stabilizers?

Yes.

You've never done it before.

I can do it. I can! I can! Arrgh!

It's not funny.

Riding without stabilizers is not easy.

Would you like some help, Peppa?

Yes, please, Daddy.

All right. Ready, steady, go!

Don't let go, Daddy.

Don't worry. I've got you.

You're doing really well, Peppa.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Secrets



Hold on, Daddy.

Just keep pedalling.

Peppa is riding on her own, without stabilizers.

Daddy, you let go!

You've been cycling on your own for ages.

Have I?

You're really very good at it.

Am I?

Oh, I can do it. Look at me. Look at me. I can ride my bike properly.

Danny, Suzy, Rebecca! Look. I don't need my stabilizers anymore. Look at me.

Hurray!

Race you to Daddy's pumpkin.

Whee!

Peppa, look out! My pumpkin!

I'm going to win.

Peppa isn't looking where she is going.

Wahhhh! Oops!

Oh dear, Peppa has squashed Daddy Pig's pumpkin.

Sorry I squashed your pumpkin, Daddy.

Never mind the pumpkin. The important thing is that you are okay. In future, you really must look where you're going.

I promise I will, Daddy.

Good. Anyway, now the pumpkin is broken, I can make it into pumpkin pie.

I love pumpkin pie.

And because Daddy Pig's pumpkin is so big, there will be enough pumpkin pie for everyone.

Hurray!



Mummy Pig has made a special box for Peppa.

Peppa, this box is just for you.

Thank you, Mummy.

It's a secret box for you to keep secret things in.

What things can I put in it, Mummy?

Only you can decide that, Peppa. It's your secret box.

I know what I can put in it.

Good. But don't tell me.

I won't tell you or George or Daddy. It's a secret.

George, this is my secret box. It's empty. I have to find some things to put inside.

George wants to help Peppa.

No, George. Only I must know what's in the box.

You have to wait outside while I choose.

Peppa is going to choose some secret things to put in the box.

Now my secret box is full. George, you must not look inside.

George would like to know what is inside Peppa's secret box.

If you like, you can try to guess.

Dinosaur.

George thinks Peppa has put a dinosaur in the box.

Oh, George. You always say dinosaur for everything.

Anyway, a dinosaur is too big to fit in the box.

George cannot guess what is in Peppa's secret box.

Daddy Pig is cleaning a picture.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Flying a Kite



Daddy, this is my secret box. Mummy made it for me.

It's very nice, Peppa. What's inside?

It's a secret. George tried to guess, but he didn't get it right.

Can I have a try?

Yes.

Hmm, have you put my glasses inside?

No. Your glasses are on your head.

So they are.

Silly Daddy. You must have a proper guess.

OK. Have you put Mummy's shoes in the box?

Nope. And that's all your guesses. Used up!

Peppa likes secrets.

Mummy, no one knows what's in my box. Oh, what has George got?

I made a box for George too. And he's filled it with secret things. And only George knows what's inside.

Oh.

Peppa would like to know what is inside George's box.

It's George's toy dinosaur, of course.

No.

George's toy dinosaur is not in George's box.

It's too difficult! I'll never guess.

Peppa does not like secrets as much as she used to.

Maybe, if you show George one thing from your box, then he could show you one thing from his.

OK. But we must do it at the same time.

That's a good idea. On the count of three, you each show what's in your boxes. Ready?

Yes.


One, two, three!

George has a drum. And Peppa has a trumpet.

Lovely!

Yes, it sounds very nice. Do you have any more secret things?

George has a custard doughnut.

Oh.

But Peppa's box is empty.

I've got nothing else.

Luckily, I have. Come on. Tuck in.

George, Peppa, Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig all like custard doughnuts.

I don't have a special box. But I know a very good place to hide my custard doughnut. Can you guess where?

Mmm, are you going to hide it in the fridge?

No! Somewhere much more special. My tummy. Mmm, delicious.

I'm going to hide mine in my tummy.

Me too.



It is a bright sunny day. Peppa and her family are in the park. They are going to fly a kite.

George is going to fly the kite first.

George runs as fast as he can. But the kite won't fly.

George! You're doing it all wrong. You didn't run fast enough. Now, it's my turn.

Peppa runs as fast as she can. But the kite still won't fly.

The kite won't fly if there isn't any wind, no matter how fast you run.

Oh.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Flying a Kite



We'll just have to wait, until the wind picks up a bit.

Oh.

Look, it's getting windy.

Now that it is windy, the kite can fly.

The wind is quite strong now.

The wind is very strong now.

George! Wahhh!

Peppa!

Thank you, Daddy.

Daddy Pig flies the kite.

Hurray! Higher, higher.

Daddy Pig flies the kite very well.

Wow!

Yes, I am a bit of an expert at these things.

Watch out for the trees. You might get the kite stuck in one.

Don't worry  I know what I'm doing.

Oh dear. Daddy Pig has got the kite caught in a tree.

Oh no.

Oh.

Don't worry, George. Daddy will get the kite down.

Hurray!

Uh, yes.

Careful. There's a big muddy puddle.

Peppa and George love to jump in muddy puddles.

Can we jump in the puddle? Please.

No. I don't want you covered in mud.

Oh.


Stand back, children.

Please be careful, Daddy Pig.

I know what I'm doing.

Please be careful.

Just a bit further, Daddy.

Daddy Pig, you are much too heavy for that branch.

Nonsense. I know exactly how heavy I am.

There.

Hurray!

Daddy Pig has rescued the kite.

Whoa!

Oh dear. Everyone is covered in mud.

It's only mud.

Luckily, Daddy Pig hasn't hurt himself.

And the kite is out of the tree.

Hurray!

Mummy. Now that we're all muddy, can we jump in the puddle?

I suppose so. After all, you can't get any muddier. And I think Daddy Pig is going to be doing the washing.

Oh.

Peppa and George love jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Mummy and Daddy love jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Jumping up and down in muddy puddles is just as much fun as flying the kite.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Picnic




It is a lovely bright, sunny day. Peppa and her family are going for a picnic. Daddy Pig is bringing the picnic basket.

Picnic blanket, bread, cheese, tomatoes and lemonade. Is there anything we've forgotten?

Mummy's strawberry cake.

I was just teasing. Mummy's homemade strawberry cake is there, too.

Is everybody ready?

Ready.

Then let's go.

This looks like just the spot for our picnic.

Hurray!

It's great to be outdoors. We should run around a bit and get some exercise.

I want to eat, then have a nap. I certainly don't want to run around.

Maybe Daddy should run around a bit. His tummy is quite big.

My tummy is not big. But later, I will get some exercise, even if no one else does.

Let's eat.

Good idea, Mummy Pig. I'm really hungry.

Mmm... Delicious.

Aah! I feel quite sleepy.

I thought you wanted to run around a bit, Daddy Pig?

Later.

Look! There's a little duck pond.

Mummy, can we feed the ducks?

Yes, you can feed them the rest of the bread.

Peppa and George love feeding bread to ducks.


Mummy, I think they want some more.

That was the last of the bread. I'm sure they've had enough.

Sorry, Mrs Duck. We've no more bread.

The ducks want more food.

So much for Daddy Pig and his exercise.

Uh? What?

You lot again! Peppa told you  there's no more bread.

Mummy, we do have strawberry cake.

Well, if there's any cake left over, you can give it to the ducks.

Everyone likes Mummy Pig's homemade strawberry cake.

Eeek! A wasp! I hate wasps. Shoo!

What a fuss, Mummy Pig. It's only a little wasp.

Go away, wasp.

Just stay still, Mummy Pig. Then it will fly away.

There! You see? All you had to do is stay still.

Eh! Get away.

Scram. Whoa... Help! Whooooaaa.

Shoo! Get it off me.

I hope the wasp doesn't sting Daddy.

Whooa! Get away, you little pest!

No, Daddy Pig is running too fast for the wasp to catch him.

Whoooa! Arrgh!

Let's eat our cake before the wasp comes back.

Oh no! We forgot to leave any for the ducks.

I think I lost it.

You said you would run around and get some exercise, Daddy Pig. But I didn't believe you'd do it.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Musical Instruments



Luckily, I managed to hang on to my slice of strawberry cake.

Stop, Daddy. We promised the rest of the cake for the ducks.

Oh.

You are very lucky ducks. Say "thank you" to Daddy Pig.

You're most welcome.

It's time to go home. Say goodbye to the ducks.

Bye bye, ducks. See you next time.



Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig have been tidying the house.

Mummy Pig and I found this old box in the attic.

Ooh!

Can anyone guess what's inside?

Hmm? Nope.

It's full of musical instruments.

Wow!

They are a bit old and dusty.

This is the violin I used to play when I was little.

Mummy, can you play your violin?

I haven't played it for a long time.

Please, Mummy. Please play it.

I hope I haven't forgotten how.

Bravo!

Hurray!

Mummy, can I play the violin?

Hold it like this.


Yes, Mummy.

Oh!

Oh, dear. I do not think it is meant to sound like that.

George wants to try.

Hold it like this, George.

Oh!

That does not sound quite right, either.

The violin is too hard to play.

Peppa, maybe you would do better with this tin drum.

Thank you, Daddy.

That sounds better. Peppa loves playing the drum.

Lovely.

Yes, it sounds very nice.

This is Daddy Pig's old accordion.

I used to play this to Mummy Pig when we first met.

Oh, Daddy Pig. You remember this tune.

George wants to play the accordion, too.

Are you sure, George? The accordion is quite difficult.

George, the a-cro-dion is almost as difficult to play as my drum.

Okay, George.

Oh.

Maybe George is a bit too little to play the accordion.

Daddy, what other instruments are in the box?

Just this horn.

Can I try?

You have to blow it very hard.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Frogs and Worms and Butterflies



That does not sound right.

It's impossible.

I think I used to be able to play it.

That really does not sound right.

Maybe it just needs someone big and strong like me.

That does not sound right, either.

Peppa's right  it is impossible to play.

Never mind, Daddy Pig. Just stick to the accordion. You play it beautifully.

Well, I do play it quite nicely, even if I say so myself.

And I'll play my violin.

And I will play my drum.

Mummy Pig plays the violin.

Daddy Pig plays the accordion.

Peppa plays the drum.

But what instrument will George play?

George is blowing the horn.

Mummy couldn't play the horn. And Daddy couldn't play it. And even I couldn't play it. But George can play it.


Peppa and George are helping Grandpa Pig in his garden.

Wow!

What a beautiful butterfly.

Grandpa, why do butterflies like flowers?

They get their food from flowers.

How?

They have very long tongues.

Longer than mine?


Oh, yes, the butterfly's tongue is even longer than yours. She uses it to drink from the flower.

Slurp! Burp!

Wow!

Peppa, the butterfly thinks you're a flower.

I'm not a flower! I'm Peppa Pig! She is so pretty. I want to be a butterfly.

Peppa is playing at being a butterfly.

I'm a little butterfly!

George wants to play, too.

George, I'm the butterfly. You have to be something else. I know. You can be a wriggly worm.

Look, look! I'm a butterfly.

Oh dear! George does not want to be a worm.

He wants to be a butterfly.

George, when I was a little piggy, I used to like playing at being a worm. It's very easy to be a worm. I'll show you how.

First, you have to lie down on the ground. Then, you wriggle around. I'm a wriggly worm!

George and Grandpa Pig are having such fun being wriggly worms.

I'm a little butterfly. I'm a little butterfly! Look, look. I'm a butterfly.

Yes, Peppa, you're a beautiful butterfly.

Grandpa, George, what are you doing?

We are wriggly worms.

I want to be a wriggly worm, too. I'm a wriggly worm.

I'm a wriggly worm.

I'm a wiggly worm. I'm a wiggly worm. How do you do? I love you. I'm a wiggly worm.

That was fun. What animal do you want to be now?

Mmm. I don't know.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Dressing Up



Look, Grandpa! There's a little frog.

Why don't you play at being frogs?

Hmm, frogs are not as pretty as butterflies or as wiggly as worms.

But frogs do play a game you like.

Hmm... Do frogs play dolls' houses?

Silly Peppa. What's your favorite game?

Jumping in muddy puddles!

Yes. Frogs love jumping in muddy puddles.

Yes, George! Let's play frogs. I'm a little froggy. I'm a little froggy.

The froggies have found a nice big muddy puddle to play in. Peppa and George love jumping up and down in muddy puddles. Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Butterflies and worms are very nice. But I like frogs the best.



Peppa and George are playing in Mummy and Daddy's bedroom.

What's this?

Peppa has found a box of old clothes.

Wow! This is Daddy's hat. And this is Mummy's dress.

George! Let's dress up and pretend to be Mummy and Daddy.

Here is Daddy's hat.

And here is Daddy's coat.

Hello, Daddy Pig.

Now it's my turn.

This is Mummy's dress.

This is Mummy's hat.

Daddy Pig, where are your shoes?


I need some shoes, too.

Now I need to look beautiful, just like Mummy.

Peppa has found Mummy's makeup box.

Aha!

First, some powder. Lovely.

Now for some lipstick.

What a pretty Mummy Pig.

Come along, Daddy Pig. It's time to go to work.

Mummy Pig is working on her computer.

Hello, Peppa. Hello, George.

I beg your pardon?

Peppa, I was just saying hello.

I'm not Peppa Pig. I'm Mummy Pig.

Oh, yes, of course. Hello, Mummy Pig.

Hello.

And this is Daddy Pig.

George.

And hello to you, too, Daddy Pig.

Excuse me  I've got a lot of work to do.

Hello! Yes. Do this. Do that. No, thank you.

Goodbye.

Peppa is enjoying pretending to be Mummy Pig.

But George is getting a bit bored.

Sorry, Daddy Pig. I'm nearly finished.

There! All done!

Come on, Daddy Pig. It's time you did some work.

Goodbye, Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig.

Goodbye.

Daddy Pig is digging in the garden.

Hello, Peppa. Hello, George.

I'm not Peppa. I'm Mummy Pig. And this is Daddy Pig.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. New Shoes



Daddy Pig is here to do some work.

That's very kind of you, Daddy Pig.

Now, be careful. It's a very deep hole.

I hope you are not digging in your best clothes, Daddy Pig.

I want to make big snorts, too.

Ice cream, everyone.

Ice cream!

Peppa! George! You must take off those muddy clothes before you eat.

I'm Mummy Pig and this is Daddy Pig.

Are you sure?

Yes.

So, where are Peppa and George?

We don't know.

Oh, well, that's a shame because I've got their favourite ice cream here. But if we can't find them, then...

Here we are.

Peppa! George! There you are.

Yes, Mummy. We were just pretending to be you and Daddy.

You really had us fooled.



Peppa and George have been playing in the garden.

Peppa, where are your shoes?

Oh, I've lost them.

Well, I'm sure we can find them. Maybe we should try the garden.

Yes.


Everyone is looking for Peppa's shoes. Mummy Pig is looking in the flowerbed. Peppa's shoes are not there.

Oh.

Daddy Pig is looking in the wheelbarrow.

Peppa's shoes are not there.

Oh.

Peppa and George look in the flowerpots.

Peppa's shoes are not there, either.

Oh.

Oh.

We've looked everywhere, but we can't find Peppa's shoes.

Peppa's shoes are lost.

Now I haven't got any shoes to wear.

Poor Peppa. Your shoes were getting a bit old. We'll buy you a new pair.

Can my new shoes be red, Mummy?

Of course, they can.

George! I'm going to have new red shoes.

Mummy Pig and Peppa are at Miss Rabbit's shoe shop.

Hello, Miss Rabbit.

Hello, Mummy Pig.

We would like to buy some new shoes for Peppa, please.

Red shoes.

I'm sure we can find you some lovely new shoes, Peppa.

Red ones, please.

Of course, red ones.

Wow! New red shoes!

George and Daddy Pig are playing draughts.

Oh, well done, George.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The School Fete



Daddy! Daddy! Look at my new shoes. They are red!

I say. They are red.

Mummy, do you like my new shoes?

Yes, Peppa. They make you look very smart.

George, do you like my new shoes?

Everyone likes Peppa's new shoes.

I like my new shoes so much. I don't want to ever take them off.

It is bath time. Peppa wants to keep her new shoes on, even for her bath.

Peppa is in her pajamas. She still has her new shoes on.

Peppa even wants to wear her new shoes in bed.

Peppa, are you sure you don't want to take your shoes off?

I don't want to ever take my new shoes off, Mummy.

Very well. Good night, Peppa and George.

Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.

Good night, my little piggies.

It has been raining all night. And now the garden is very wet.

Mummy Pig is wearing her boots. Daddy Pig is wearing his boots. George is wearing his boots. Peppa is still wearing her new red shoes.

George is going to play in the wet grass.

Oh, dear. Peppa loves playing in the wet grass, but she doesn't want to get her new shoes wet.

I can't play in the wet grass, George.

Oh.

George loves jumping in muddy puddles. Peppa loves jumping in puddles, but she doesn't want to get her new shoes muddy.


Oh.

Mummy and Daddy love jumping up and down in muddy puddles. Everyone likes jumping in muddy puddles.

Where is Peppa going?

Peppa is putting on her boots.

Wheeeeee!

If you jump in muddy puddles, you must wear your boots.



Today is the day of the school fete. Peppa loves coming to the fete.

Here are Peppa's friends: Candy Cat, Suzy Sheep, Danny Dog, Rebecca Rabbit, and Pedro Pony.

Hello, everyone.

Peppa's Friends: Hello, Peppa.

I love the school fete.

Me, too. What do you like best?

The face painting.

I like the balloons.

I like the bouncy castle the best.

I like everything.

A very good choice, Peppa.

See you later, Peppa.

See you later.

George, what do you like best?

Dinosaur. Grrr!

Oh, dear. There aren't any dinosaurs at the fete, George.

Maybe we can get you a dinosaur balloon.

Are you sure they have dinosaur balloons, Daddy Pig?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The School Fete



I'm certain of it.

Can George and I get our faces painted first?

Of course.

Miss Rabbit has painted Peppa's friends as tigers.

There you are, Suzy. Now you look like a tiger.

Thank you, Miss Rabbit.

Wow! I like your face, Suzy. Are you a pussycat?

No. I'm a tiger.

Peppa, would you like your face painted?

Yes, please. Can I be an elephant?

Oh dear, I don't know how to do elephants. I can do tigers.

Yes, a tiger, please.

There you are, Peppa. Now you're a tiger.

I'm a tiger.

George, what would you like to be?

Dinosaur. Grrr!

A dinosaur? Uh, how about a tiger instead? I'm good at tigers.

I'm a tiger. Oink!

So am I. Woof woof!

Meow! Tigers don't say "woof woof".

How do you know?

Because tigers are big cats. And I'm a cat.

Candy, please can you teach us how to be tigers?

Okay. Tigers creep very very slowly. And then, they jump. Grrr!

Tigers like to lick themselves clean.

But best of all, when tigers are happy, they purr.

Hello, children. My goodness. You're all tigers.


And I'm teaching them to be proper tigers. Grrr!

What do you little tigers want to do next?

Dinosaur.

That's right. We have to find George a dinosaur balloon.

Let's get you all balloons.

Hurray!

Hello, Madame Gazelle. We'd like some balloons, please.

Certainly. I've got lots of different ones.

Can I have an elephant balloon, please?

Here you are, Peppa.

Can I have a kangaroo?

A lion, please.

A monkey, please.

A parrot, please.

Yes, I've got all those.

Most important of all, we need a dinosaur balloon for George.

Oh, dear. I do not seem to have any dinosaur balloons.

Oh.

Don't worry, George. I've got an idea.

Could we have two of the long balloons, please?

Watch this, everybody.

What is Daddy Pig doing with the balloons?

There. Can anyone guess what it is?

Is it a kangaroo?

No, it's a...

Dinosaur.

That's right, a dinosaur.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mummy Pig's Birthday



Daddy Pig has made a balloon dinosaur.

Grrr! Dinosaur.

Now, the bouncy castle.

Peppa loves bouncing on the bouncy castle.

Everyone loves bouncing on the bouncy castle.

This is the best school fete ever.



Today is Mummy Pig's birthday. Daddy Pig has made Mummy Pig breakfast in bed.

Happy birthday, Mummy Pig.

Peppa and George have made Mummy Pig a birthday card.

Happy birthday, Mummy.

Oh! What a lovely birthday surprise.

And there are more surprises to come. Enjoy your birthday breakfast. Take your time.

Mmm! Yummy.

Quick! We have to get everything else ready.

Daddy Pig has made a birthday cake for Mummy Pig.

We've just got to put the candles on. One, two...

Here I come.

Mummy Pig has finished her birthday breakfast.

Mummy's coming.

Oh, no. We're not ready yet.

Uh, who is it?

It's Mummy. Can I come in?

No! No!

Is there something secret going on?

Uh, no, nothing's going on. But you can't come in.


I see.

Mummy Pig, why don't you relax in the sitting room?

That sounds nice.

Well, it is your birthday.

Okay, Peppa. I think I know where the sitting room is.

Here's a nice magazine.

Thank you, Peppa.

And here's some pretty music.

Thank you, Peppa.

We need the same number of candles as Mummy's age.

One, two, three.

Oh, dear. We haven't got nearly enough candles.

Daddy, how old is Mummy?

I'll whisper it in your ear.

Wow! Really old.

You know, I think three candles will be fine.

Mummy Pig's birthday cake is ready.

Hurray!

We just have to put up the decorations in the sitting room.

Hello, Mummy.

Ah, there you all are. I was getting a little bored.

Mummy, would you like to have a nice walk in the garden?

Do I have any choice?

Nope.

Bye bye, Mummy. Have a lovely walk. We'll call you when it's safe to come back in.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Tooth Fairy



I'd forgotten what hard work birthdays were.

Daddy Pig, Peppa and George are decorating the sitting room.

This is fun.

Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig have arrived for Mummy Pig's birthday.

Happy Birthday, Mummy Pig.

Aren't you coming inside?

Oh, I can't come in yet. Daddy Pig, Peppa and George are doing secret things for my birthday.

How lovely. See you later.

Bye.

Mummy, would you like to come inside now?

I'd love to.

Close your eyes.

Keep your eyes closed, Mummy.

One, two, three. Open your eyes.

Happy

Birthday, Mummy Pig.

What a lovely surprise.

Blow the candles out. And make a wish.

Mummy, Mummy, open your present. Can you guess what it is?

I've no idea.

Open it and see.

It's a beautiful dress.

You're beautiful, Mummy.

Now you just need somewhere nice to wear it.

What's this?

Two tickets to the theatre. Tonight.

Thank you.

Mummy Pig loves going to the theatre.


And Granny Pig and I are going to babysit the little ones.

Hurray!

What a super birthday. I'm the luckiest mummy in the whole world.

And the most beautiful.



Peppa and George are having their favourite food-spaghetti.

What a lot of noise.

Finished!

Ah, now we'll have a bit of quiet.

What's that?

It's a tooth.

Where did that come from?

Peppa, maybe you should look in the mirror.

Oh. It's my tooth. It's fallen out.

Don't worry, Peppa. It's just a milk tooth.

They're meant to fall out.

Will I grow a new one, Mummy?

Yes, you will, Peppa.

It also means the tooth fairy will be paying you a visit.

Tooth fairy?

Yes, the tooth fairy. If you put the tooth under your pillow tonight, the tooth fairy will come.

The tooth fairy will take the tooth. And in its place she will leave a shiny coin.

When I grow up, I want to be a tooth fairy.

And what would you like to be when you grow up, George?

Dinosaur!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The New Car



A dinosaur.

Quick, George. It's bedtime. We don't want to miss the tooth fairy.

Before going to bed, Peppa and George brush their teeth.

Peppa, what are you doing?

I'm brushing my tooth so it's nice and clean for the tooth fairy.

Peppa cannot wait to get into bed.

Peppa is putting her tooth under the pillow for the tooth fairy.

Good night, Peppa and George.

Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.

Good night, my little piggies.

George, I'm not going to sleep. Let's both stay awake all night and see the tooth fairy.

This tooth fairy is very late.

The tooth fairy is taking a long time to arrive.

Where is that tooth fairy?

What is that noise? Is it the tooth fairy?

George, can you hear something? Oh, George.

Oh, the noise is George. He was so tired he has fallen asleep.

George is not very good at staying awake, but I am. I'm going to stay awake and see the tooth fairy. I'm not going to sleep.

The tooth fairy has arrived. But Peppa is asleep.

Hello, Peppa. Would you like this coin in return for your tooth?

What a nice clean tooth. Thank you, Peppa.

Good night.

Peppa, George, wake up. It's morning.

What? I wasn't asleep.

Did the tooth fairy come?


No.

Let's take a look under your pillow.

Look, Peppa. The tooth fairy has been and she's left you a coin.

Hurray!

You fell asleep, didn't you?

Well, maybe I fell asleep just for a little bit. Next time, I will stay awake, and I will see the tooth fairy.



Today Peppa and her family are going for a drive in their red car.

Shall we have the roof down?

Yes, please.

Peppa and George love their car.

Is everybody ready?

Ready.

Then let's go.

I love our car.

And our car loves us, too. Don't you?

Oh, dear. The car does not sound very well.

Hmm!

What's wrong, Daddy?

Hmm! Uh, I don't know.

Let's take it to Granddad Dog's garage. He can fix it.

That's a good idea, Mummy Pig.

Woof!

Granddad Dog runs the garage. He is very good at mending cars.

Woof! Oh, dear, Daddy Pig. Your car does not sound very well.

Can you fix it please, Granddad Dog?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The New Car



Yes. But it will take all day.

Peppa's Family: Oh.

We wanted to go for a drive in our car.

Woof! Don't worry. You can borrow this new car while I fix yours.

Peppa's Family: Hurray!

Thank you, Granddad Dog.

Would you like the roof down?

Yes, please.

I'll just press this red button.

What a clever car.

Peppa's Family: Wow.

Woof! When you come back, I will have fixed your car.

Thank you, Granddad Dog. Goodbye.

Goodbye.

Bye bye.

Goodbye. Woof!

Peppa and her family like the new blue car.

There are so many buttons in this new car.

What does the green button do, Daddy?

Let's see.

Magic windows.

Daddy, make the magic windows go down.

What does the blue button do?

I don't know. Let's see. Argh!

I love this new car. Can we keep it?

No, we can't keep it, Peppa. We've only borrowed it for today.

Oh.

Oh, no. I think it's going to rain.

Yes, I'll just put the roof up.


Now, which is the button to close the roof?

Oops. Silly me. Aha! This must be the button. Argh!

The new car has squirted Daddy Pig with water.

Silly Daddy. That's not the roof.

This button. Oops. Not that one.

This button. Argh! Help!

Daddy Pig has forgotten which button closes the roof.

I don't think this car likes me.

Let's try the red button.

Peppa's Family: Hurray!

But now it's stopped raining.

Can we open the roof again?

Uh, yes. Which button was it?

The red one.

Peppa's Family: Hurray!

Granddad Dog has fixed the car.

Your car is fixed.

Peppa's Family: Hurray!

Thank you, Granddad Dog. And keep the change.

Thank you, Daddy Pig.

Woof woof! Goodbye.

Goodbye.

Goodbye.

Bye bye.

Ah! It's good to get our old car back again.

I like the new car, but I like our old car better.

And I think our old car likes us too. Don't you?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Treasure Hunt




Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig are making a treasure hunt for Peppa and George. Granny Pig is drawing the treasure map. Grandpa Pig is burying the treasure in a secret place in the garden.

Grandpa Pig! Have you finished? Peppa and George will be here soon.

No need to panic, Granny Pig.

Peppa and her family are here.

Quick, Grandpa Pig. They're here.

Almost done.

Grandpa Pig just finished in time.

Granny Pig. We're here!

Ganny 'ig!

Hello, my little ones.

Grandpa Pig!

Baba 'ig!

Ahoy there, me hearties!

Peppa, George, we've made you a treasure hunt.

Somewhere in the garden is buried treasure.

Wow! Treasure! Where is it?

You have to look for it.

Here's a treasure map for Peppa.

And George can wear my pirate hat. Ahoy there, Captain George.

The map is a bit difficult. Daddy, can you help?

Of course, Peppa. I'm very good with maps. Uh.

It is a bit difficult.

Daddy Pig, you're holding the map upside down.

Yes, I thought as much.



It's easy! The red cross shows where the treasure is.

But where in the garden are those two apple trees?

Hmm. I don't know.

Would you like a clue?

Yes, please.

The first clue is in a bottle. But where is the bottle?

I can see it.

Peppa has found the first clue-a message in a bottle.

Look, everyone! Here's the bottle!

Well done, Peppa. Let's see what the message says. Oh, it's a message from a pirate.

Mummy, can you read the pirate's message?

Hmm, this pirate has very bad handwriting.

The pirate's handwriting is excellent.

No, I can't make it out at all.

The pirate has clearly written: "Follow the arrows."

Follow the arrows?

George has found the second clue-sticks in the shape of an arrow.

Look! They point this way.

Peppa and George are following the arrows.

Look, George! A key!

Peppa has found the next clue-a key.

Well done, Peppa. Now you just have to find the treasure chest that it unlocks.

But there aren't any more clues.

Maybe you should take another look at the map. Look, Peppa. The map has two apple trees on it.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Not Very Well



Here's an apple tree. And here's an apple tree. So the treasure must be here.

Let's take a look.

Oh, dear. There doesn't seem to be anything here.

Hang on. There is something here.

Wow! Treasure!

Hurray!

Well done. Well done.

I've got the key to open it.

Wow! I can't believe it! Gold coins! They must be worth a fortune.

It's better than that. They are not gold coins  they are chocolate coins.

And there's a chocolate coin for everybody.

Hurray!

Peppa and George love chocolate coins.

Everyone loves chocolate coins.

Granny, Grandpa, this is the best treasure hunt ever.



Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig have just made breakfast for Peppa and George.

Breakfast is ready.

Peppa has red spots on her face.

Mummy, I don't feel very well.

Oh, dear, Peppa. You don't look very well.

Don't worry. I'll ring Dr Brown Bear.

Dr Brown Bear speaking.

Peppa is not very well. Her face is covered in red spots.


Hmm. Put Peppa to bed and I'll come straight round.

Dr Brown Bear has come to make Peppa better.

Hello, Peppa. How are you today?

I'm not very well.

Stick your tongue out, please.

Hmm. It's not anything serious. Peppa has just got a rash.

Do I need medicine?

The rash will clear up quickly. But if you like I can give you just a little medicine.

Yes, please.

I'm afraid it doesn't taste very nice. Open wide, please.

Urgh! Disgusting!

You are a brave little one for taking it so well.

Peppa must stay in bed. I'll call back later to check that she is better.

Can Peppa have visitors?

Oh, yes, she can have visitors. The rash isn't catching. Goodbye.

Goodbye, Dr Brown Bear.

Mummy, can I get up now?

Dr Brown Bear says that you must stay in bed for a little bit, Peppa.

Oh. But it's so boring.

Dr Brown Bear did say you could have visitors.

Could Suzy Sheep visit me?

Suzy Sheep is Peppa's best friend.

I'll ring Suzy Sheep's mummy.

Hello, Mrs Pig.

May Peppa talk with Suzy, please?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Snow



Hello, Suzy.

Hello, Peppa.

I'm not very well. I have red spots on my face.

Has the doctor been?

Yes, Dr Brown Bear was here. He said I wasn't very well and that I was very brave.

So are you really ill?

Yes, yes. It's not pretend. I have to stay in bed. Dr Brown Bear gave me medicine that tasted really horrible.

I'm coming to see you. I'm going to wear my nurse's outfit.

Suzy Sheep has come to see Peppa. Suzy is wearing her nurse's costume. Danny Dog and Rebecca Rabbit have come along, too.

Hello, Peppa.

Hello.

How do you feel?

I am not very well, Suzy. I have to stay in bed.

What can we do to make you better?

You could get me some orange juice.

Okay.

Peppa seems to be quite enjoying herself.

Thank you, Suzy.

Do you feel any better?

A little bit. Danny.

Woof!

Ask my mummy if I could have some ice cream. And Rebecca, could you bring me some flowers from the garden?

Dr Brown Bear is here, to see if Peppa is better.

Ah, good, the nurse is already here. How is the patient?

Uh, I'm not a real nurse. It's just pretend.


I see. Would you like me to take a look myself?

Yes, please.

I say! No more red spots! You're completely better.

Aren't I still a bit ill?

How do you feel?

I think I should stay in bed a little bit more.

Hmm, I fancy a game with this ball in the garden. Who wants to join me?

Me! Me! Me!

Me too!

Well, I never. A complete recovery.



Peppa and George are very excited today. It is snowing outside.

Mummy! Can we go and play in the snow?

Yes, but it's very cold outside, so you must wrap up warm.

Hurray!

And don't forget to wear your hats and scarves and gloves.

It is very cold outside. Peppa and George must wear their hats and scarves and gloves.

Come on, George.

Peppa and George are making footprints in the snow. Peppa and George love making footprints in the snow.

Oops!

Oh, dear.

It's not funny.

George, let's play snowballs.

Peppa has made a snowball.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Windy Castle



Peppa and George are having a lot of fun.

George, come back, you little piggy.

Oh, dear. Maybe this game is getting a little too rough.

Sorry, George.

George! Let's build a snowman.

Peppa and George are making a snowman. First they make the body.

George, this is the snowman's body.

Now they make the snowman's head.

Now he needs arms and eyes and a mouth.

George has found some sticks for the snowman's arms.

Peppa has found some stones for the snowman's eyes and mouth.

This is his face.

Now the snowman needs a nose.

Peppa has got a carrot, to make the snowman's nose.

The snowman looks very happy. But maybe he is a bit cold.

The snowman needs some clothes to keep him warm.

George has found some clothes to keep the snowman nice and warm.

The snowman is wearing his hat and scarf and gloves.

Mummy! Daddy! Come and look.

Mummy Pig is wearing her hat and scarf and gloves.

That is the best snowman I have ever seen.

Daddy Pig looks quite cold. He isn't wearing his hat and scarf and gloves.

Daddy, why aren't you wearing your hat and scarf and gloves?


I don't know where they are. I can't find them anywhere.

I think I know where Daddy's hat, scarf and gloves are.

Daddy Pig's hat and scarf and gloves are on the snowman.

Oh.



Peppa and her family are going out for the day.

Peppa, George, today we're going to Windy Castle.

What's Windy Castle, Daddy?

It's a castle on a very high hill.

George likes castles.

Windy Castle sounds like a boring thing, for boys.

No, Peppa. You'll love it. There's a great view from the top of Windy Castle. You can even see Granny and Grandpa's house.

Wow! Let's go.

I'll map read and Mummy Pig will drive.

Are you sure, Daddy Pig? When you map read we always get lost and you get grumpy.

We will not get lost. And I will not get grumpy.

Windy Castle, here we come.

Are we nearly there yet?

Not quite.

Oh.

Would you like to play a game?

Yes, please. Let's play I Spy.

OK. I'll go first.

Daddy Pig has to secretly look at something and the others have to guess what it is.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Windy Castle



I spy with my little eye something coloured red.

Red. My dress. That's red.

No, it's not your dress.

Mmm? The car.

That's right, our red car.

My go. I spy with my little eye something blue.

Mmm. George's blue shirt.

No.

Is it something in the car?

No. Give up?

Yes.

The sky. The blue sky. I win.

Daddy Pig, do you know where we are?

I know exactly where we are. Although, this road doesn't look the same as it does on this map.

Oh, Daddy Pig. We're lost.

We are not lost.

So how do we get to Windy Castle from here?

Just give me a moment. Mmm.

I know. We can ring Granny and Grandpa.

There's no need to ring Granny and Grandpa.

I'll get us to Windy Castle if it takes me all day.

We haven't got all day.

Hello, Grandpa Pig speaking.

Grandpa Pig, we've got a bit lost on the way to Windy Castle.

Is Daddy Pig doing the map reading?

Yes, Daddy Pig is doing the map reading and he's a bit grumpy at the moment.

I am not grumpy.


This is the best route. Keep on the main road until you see Windy Castle up ahead.

Thank you, Grandpa Pig.

We follow the main road and look out for Windy Castle.

As I thought.

Look. Is that a castle?

Yes. It's Windy Castle.

Come on, car.

Go on, car. You can make it.

Hooray!

Peppa and her family have arrived at Windy Castle.

Wow, it's so tall.

Let's go inside. The view from the top is fantastic.

Wow!

Look at the view.

Mummy, is that Granny and Grandpa's house?

Yes, it is.

It's so far away.

Let's take a look through the telescope.

Can I look first, please?

Yes, but you must let George look next.

Wow!

The telescope makes everything look bigger.

I can see Granny and Grandpa.

Look, George.

Ganny 'ig! Baba 'ig!

George is waving at Granny and Grandpa.

Silly George. Granny and Grandpa are too far away to see you waving.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. My Cousin Chlo



I know. We can ring them.

Hello.

Grandpa Pig, we can see you from Windy Castle. Wave at us.

Granny and Grandpa are waving at us.

I love Windy Castle.



Peppa and George are playing in the garden.

To me, George.

You threw the ball too hard, George. So the rules say I win.

Now it's my turn.

I win again.

Peppa, George, today your big cousin Chlo is coming to visit.

Yipee, cousin Chlo!

George, Chlo's a big girl like me. So don't be sad if she finds you too little to play with.

I'm sure Chlo will play with both of you.

Chlo's here.

Aunty Pig has brought Chlo to spend the day at Peppa's house. Chlo is Peppa and George's cousin.

Chlo is a bit older than Peppa and George.

Hello, Chlo.

Hello, Peppa. Hello, George.

See you later.

Do you want to play a game?

Yes, let's play catch.

Peppa loves playing catch.

Do you still play catch? That's a game for little children.

Oh. We only play catch because George likes it.


OK, let's play it for George. Do you play it with the proper rules or the baby rules?

Proper rules.

I'll start. Peppa, you're "it". Catch me if you can.

Peppa is "it". She has to chase Chlo and George.

Can't catch me.

George, I'm going to easily catch you. You're so little.

That's not fair. You're helping George.

That's because he's little. Do you want me to help you?

No. I don't need help. I'm a big girl like you.

Come on then, Peppa. Try and catch us.

Can't catch us.

Can't catch us.

This is a silly game. Can we play something else?

OK, I know a really good game for big children. It's called Sly Fox.

Sly Fox! I want to play Sly Fox. What is it?

One person is the sly fox, and the others creep up on them.

Me, me! I want to be the sly fox.

Peppa is the sly fox. While her back is turned, the others creep up on her. But if Peppa turns and sees someone move, they have to go back to the start.

George, I saw you move. Back to the start.

Got you. I win.

You moved before I was ready.

The rules say I can move when I like, don't they, George?

Now it's Chlo's turn to be the sly fox.

Peppa and George must stay very still.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pancakes



Peppa, I saw you move. Back to the start.

It's not fair. You looked too long.

The rules say I can look as long as I want.

Back to the start.

George is the winner.

Can we play a different game?

Yes, but as long as it's a grown-up game.

I know. Let's play my favourite game. It's very grown-up.

George, do you know what Peppa's favourite game is?

Peppa's favourite game is jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

George, if you jump in puddles, you must wear your boots. I've brought some boots for you too, Chlo.

I'm too grown-up to jump in muddy puddles.

Oh. So am I.

George loves jumping in muddy puddles.

Secretly Peppa would love to jump in the puddle, but she wants to look grown-up.

I hear there's some puddle jumping going on.

Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig love jumping in muddy puddles.

It does look fun.

Yes, it does.

Maybe there's a rule that says big girls can jump in muddy puddles.

Yes, that's a good rule.

Race you.

Race you.

Peppa and Chlo love jumping up and down in muddy puddles.



Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles. Even grown-up girls.



It is teatime and Mummy Pig has a surprise for everyone.

Today is a day for pancakes.

Pancakes. Delicious.

I love pancakes.

Everyone loves pancakes.

I'm the expert at flipping the pancakes over.

Leave that to me.

Are you sure, Daddy Pig? Last time you got a bit grumpy when you dropped the pancake on the floor.

I did not get grumpy. There was a problem with the frying pan.

Mummy, can we help make the pancakes, please?

Yes, you can help me make the batter.

First, I put some flour in the bowl.

Ooh.

Now I add an egg. Now the milk. And I give it all a stir.

Mummy, can I stir?

Yes, of course, Peppa.

Peppa loves stirring. George wants to stir as well.

No, George. Like this.

Okay, that's enough stirring. You two sit at the table while I cook the pancakes.

Mummy Pig is going to flip the pancake over.

Hooray!

You could flip it higher, Mummy Pig.

You can show us how when you flip your own pancake, Daddy Pig.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Babysitting



This first pancake is for George.

Mummy Pig pours a little syrup on George's pancake.

Delicious.

This pancake is for Peppa.

Hurray!

Mmm. You could flip it higher, Mummy Pig.

You will get a chance to show me when you flip your own pancake, Daddy Pig.

Syrup please.

Mmm, delicious!

This pancake is for Mummy Pig.

Hurray!

You still aren't flipping them high enough, Mummy Pig.

The next pancake is yours, Daddy Pig. So now you can show us how it should be done.

Mmm, delicious!

Is everyone watching? The secret of making a good pancake is to flip it high into the air.

A-one, two, three, hoopla!

Silly Daddy.

Oh, maybe that was just a bit too high.

What a shame. That was the last pancake.

It should be a simple matter to get it down.

Oh dear. Daddy Pig cannot reach his pancake.

Don't worry, Daddy Pig. I think I know a way to get it down.

Let's go upstairs, children.

This way.

What is Mummy Pig planning to do?

On the count of three we all have to start jumping up and down. One, two, three, jump!


What are they doing?

It worked! Now Daddy Pig has his pancake.

Daddy has a pancake on his head.

Syrup on your pancake, Daddy Pig?

Yes, please.

One, two, three, hoopla!

Mmm, delicious!

Silly daddy.



Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are going out for the evening. Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig are going to babysit.

Granny Pig! Grandpa Pig!

Ganny 'ig! Baba 'ig!

Hello, my little ones.

Hello.

Peppa, George, into your beds, quick.

Good night, my little piggies.

Good night, sleep tight.

Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.

What little darlings.

Now go to sleep quickly.

Yes, Mummy.

So well-behaved.

Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are leaving for their evening out.

Peppa and George are so good. They just fell asleep when Mummy Pig told them to.

This babysitting is easy.

George. George, are you awake?

What strange noises.

I wonder if we should check upstairs.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Ballet Lesson



Peppa, George, are you awake?

Well, I never. Fast asleep.

So, it wasn't Peppa and George making all that noise.

I can't hear anything.

I think they really have fallen asleep. Let's watch some television.

Gardening. Today we are talking about roses.

Oh, I love gardening programmes.

The kiftsgate is a particularly thorny rose. To prune it, start by lopping off the head, and then snip away the budding shoots.

Granny Pig.

Peppa, George. You should be in bed asleep.

George and I aren't sleepy at all. Can we watch TV with you?

Well, I suppose watching a little TV might make you sleepy.

Hurray!

Icelandic roses are a rare treat for the discerning horticulturist. But they are prone to lobbing in temperate habitats.

This programme is very boring.

Grandpa Pig, can we play that game where you throw us up and catch us?

OK, but just one turn each.

Whee! You seem heavier than before.

Now it's George's turn.

My turn.

Higher, higher!

Maybe Grandpa Pig is a bit tired.

I know. Granny Pig, let's play catch.

Uh...

You're "it." Catch us if you can.


Can't catch me.

I'm going to catch you.

Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are back home.

I hope our little piggies are asleep.

Hello. Anyone here?

The little piggies are asleep and so are the big piggies.



Peppa is going to her first ballet lesson.

This is Madame Gazelle, the ballet teacher.

Aha, you must be young Peppa. I am Madame Gazelle.

Hello, Madame.

Oh, so sweet. Welcome to your first lesson of the ballet.

I'll pick you up later.

Bye-bye.

Enjoy yourself.

Here are Peppa's friends, Candy Cat, Suzy Sheep, Danny Dog, Rebecca Rabbit and Pedro Pony.

Children, today we have a new pupil, Peppa Pig. Now, Peppa, run and join your friends.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Peppa.

We begin with demi-plie.

Demi-plie.

Now, a little jump. Petit-jete. With grace and beauty. Petit-jete. Grace and beauty. Petit-jete. Grace and beauty.

The ballet lesson is a lot of fun.

Raise your arms. Imagine that you are beautiful swans. And what noise do you think a swan might make?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Thunderstorm



Woof woof.

Baa.

Meow.

Neigh.

Oink.

Grace and beauty.

Peppa loves dancing. Everyone loves dancing.

Mummy, Mummy, we all danced as swans.

Peppa did very well.

I had to dance beautifully and gracefully.

That's lovely.

Can I show you how I did it?

Let's get home first. Then you can show Daddy Pig, George and me.

Bye bye.

Peppa and Mummy Pig are home.

Daddy, George, I'm going to show you how to do ballet.

Is it difficult?

It was easy for me, but you, George and Mummy will find it very hard. First, we need music.

Good. Now, George, Daddy and Mummy, you must copy what I do. Madame Gazelle used funny words, but really it's just bending your knees and jumping.

Ah, the petit-jete.

Daddy, you know the funny words.

Mummy Pig and I used to be quite good at ballet.

Do be careful, Daddy Pig.

Our favourite was the pas de deux. Hoopla!

That wasn't quite how I remembered it.

Silly Daddy Pig.

Maybe we should leave the ballet to Peppa.


Yes, I am the best at it.

I am a beautiful swan. Oink!



It is a lovely sunny day. Peppa and George are having a picnic.

Here's some orange juice for you, Teddy. What do you say? Thank you very much, Peppa. You're very welcome, Teddy.

Here's some orange juice for you, Mr Dinosaur. And what do you say?

Grrr!

You're very welcome, Mr Dinosaur. Would Teddy or Mr Dinosaur like a cookie? We're not very hungry, so Peppa and George can eat all the cookies.

Thank you, Teddy.

What was that strange noise?

Peppa, George, quick! Come inside the house.

Mummy, there was a loud bang sound.

It's thunder, Peppa. It means there will be a thunderstorm with lots of rain. Quick, into the house before the rain starts.

No need to panic. The rain is still a long way off.

The sky is getting darker and darker. There is going to be a thunderstorm.

Peppa, George, did you bring all your toys in from the garden?

Dinosaur.

Good, Mr Dinosaur is safe.

Teddy! I left Teddy in the garden! He'll get wet!

Don't worry, Peppa. Daddy Pig will rescue Teddy.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Cleaning the Car



You'd better hurry, Daddy Pig. It's just about to rain.

I know all about thunderstorms. It won't rain for ages.

As I thought. Plenty of time before it rains.

Poor Teddy. He's soaking wet.

Yes, poor Teddy. Let's get him dry.

Poor Teddy.

There you are, Teddy. All dry.

Achoo! What about poor Daddy? I'm soaking wet too.

Oh, sorry, Daddy Pig. Let's get you dry. There you are, Daddy Pig. Nice and dry.

Oh.

The rain is coming in the house. The floor is getting wet.

Oh, dear. What can we do, Daddy Pig?

Don't worry.

Daddy Pig is using a bucket to catch the drips.

Well done, Daddy Pig.

Easy as pie. What?

Quick! Find something else to catch the water.

Well done, Peppa.

Easy as pie.

Mummy, the thunder bangs are very loud.

It's okay, children. Don't be frightened.

Let's count between each flash and bang.

The higher we can count, the further away the thunderstorm is.

One, two, three...

That's three.

Peppa's Family: One, two, three, four, five...


That's five! The thunderstorm is going away.

The thunderstorm is over.

Peppa's Family: Hooray!

The thunderstorm has filled the garden with muddy puddles.

Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles. Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

I love thunderstorms. They make muddy puddles.

Splish, splash, splosh, splosh.



Daddy Pig is taking the family for a drive in the country.

Come on. Is everybody ready?

Ready.

Yes, Daddy Pig. We're ready. But the car isn't ready. Look how messy it is.

Oh, it's not too bad. You should see how messy it is inside.

Naughty, messy Daddy.

Naughty, messy Daddy.

Look at all this rubbish. Newspapers.

They're mine.

Sweets.

They're mine.

Mr Dinosaur.

Dinosaur, grrr.

We must clean the car before we go for a drive.

Oh, right you are, Mummy Pig.

Mummy, can we help to clean the car?

Yes, if you want to.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Lunch



Hooray!

Daddy Pig has some warm, soapy water to wash the car.

Daddy Pig is washing the roof. Mummy Pig is washing the bonnet. Peppa is washing the doors. George wants to wash the windows, but he is too little.

Poor George. Let me help you.

Oh, dear. George has dropped his sponge in a muddy puddle.

George, you're making the car all muddy again. I will wash the mud off.

Peppa, don't use the...muddy water.

Oh, dear. Peppa has thrown the muddy water all over the car.

Oh.

Never mind. We can use the garden hose to clean it off.

Yes, yes. Can I hold the hose?

Peppa holds the hose, and Daddy Pig turns on the water.

Where's the water?

Peppa, stop!

Sorry, Mummy. Oh.

Daddy Pig, please turn off the water.

Oh. No need to panic.

Oh, dear. Everyone is wet.

At least the car has been washed.

We've all been washed.

You go and dry yourselves while I polish the car.

See you later.

See you later.


Daddy Pig is polishing the car so well he can see his face in it. What a funny face. Oh, more funny faces. It's Peppa and George. And Mummy Pig.

What a lovely, shiny car.

Yes, I am a bit of an expert at these things.

Come on, I'll drive today.

Is everybody ready?

Ready.

Then let's go.

I hope we will all keep this car clean today.

Yes, Mummy Pig.

Yes, Mummy Pig.

Argh!

Mummy, now you've made the car all muddy again.

Naughty Mummy.

Naughty, messy Mummy



Peppa and George have come to Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig's house for lunch.

Granny Pig!

Ganny 'ig!

Hello, my little ones. Would you like to pick some vegetables from the garden for lunch?

Yes, please.

Grandpa Pig!

Baba 'ig!

Hello, Peppa, George.

This is Grandpa Pig's vegetable garden. He has grown all these vegetables himself.

Grrr.

What's this?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Lunch



Dinosaur.

A dinosaur? Ho ho ho ho. Let's choose some vegetables for lunch. Peppa, do you like tomatoes?

Yes, Grandpa Pig.

George, do you like tomatoes?

No.

George does not like tomatoes.

Oh, dear. Do you both like lettuce?

Yes, Grandpa Pig.

No.

George does not like lettuce.

Oh, dear. I must have something that George likes.

Do you like cucumber?

Yuck!

George does not like cucumbers. And he does not like lettuce. And he does not like tomatoes.

Well, George, what vegetable do you like?

Chocolate cake.

Silly George. Chocolate cake isn't a vegetable.

Maybe George will like the vegetables when they're made into a lovely salad.

Oh, lovely fresh tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber. First, we have to wash them.

Peppa and George help Granny Pig wash the vegetables.

Maybe that's enough washing.

Granny Pig has made the tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber into a salad.

Grandpa Pig, can you call everyone to lunch?

Lunch!

Granny Pig has made pizza for lunch.


And here's some salad made with Grandpa's tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber.

Tuck in, everyone.

George has eaten his pizza, but George does not like the tomatoes, or the lettuce, or the cucumber.

Oh, dear, George. Don't you like the salad?

No.

George, just try a little bit of this lovely tomato.

Yuck!

George, this is cucumber. Grandpa Pig grew it in his garden.

Urgh!

Try a piece of lettuce, George. It's yummy.

Oh, now, now, George. Look what I'm doing.

Now it's a dinosaur.

Dinosaur. Grrr!

George loves dinosaurs. George is eating the tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber.

Well done, George.

Would you like some more, George?

Full.

George, are you too full to eat any more tomatoes, lettuce or cucumber?

George is too full to eat any more.

George, are you too full to eat anything more?

George is too full to eat anything more.

Oh, well. Then you won't want any of this chocolate cake.

Chocolate cake!

My word! George seems to have got his appetite back.






	 



Collecting sticks is fun.

Good, that's enough sticks.

That's a splendid campfire. Now I'll light it.

bedtime.

We won't all fit in. The tent is too little.

It will be fine. In you go.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Sleepy Princess



Move further in, Mummy Pig.

Daddy, you're too big for the tent.

Never mind. I'd rather sleep outside anyway.

Good night, Daddy Pig.

Good night, Daddy.

Night-night.

Good night, everyone.

Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are sleeping in the tent. Daddy Pig is sleeping outside under the stars.

I love camping, sleeping in the open air with the stars above me.

Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all.

It is morning.

Daddy, it was lovely and cosy in the tent. Oh, where's Daddy?

Daddy Pig has gone.

Poor Daddy Pig. He must have been cold and wet. And now where is he?

What's that sound?

It sounds like snoring.

Daddy Pig!

What?

Daddy, you're safe.

Of course I'm safe. I'm an expert at camping. I slept in the car.

Silly Daddy.

I love camping.



It is night time. Peppa and George are going to bed.

Good night, Peppa and George.

Mummy, Daddy?


Yes, Peppa?

I'm not sleepy. Can I have a story?

Maybe George is sleepy and doesn't want a story.

George, do you want a story? Say yes.

All right, I will tell you just one story.

If Daddy Pig tells you a story, you must both promise to go to sleep.

We promise.

Mmm, I think I'll tell you the story of the sleepy princess.

Is it a good story? It sounds a bit boring.

It's not boring. It's very good.

Is there a little princess in it?

Peppa, if you keep talking, Daddy Pig can't start the story.

Sorry, Mummy. Is there a little princess in the story, Daddy?

Yes, there is a little princess in it. Mmm. The Sleepy Princess. Once upon a time in a castle there lived a little princess, and she was called the sleepy princess.

Daddy, why was she called that?

I'll get to that later.

Was the sleepy princess pretty?

Yes, she was very pretty. She loved looking at herself in the mirror.

I am so pretty.

Who else was living in the castle?

Uh, well...

The others in the castle were the small prince, Queen Mummy and King Daddy.

That's right. They were all living there as well.

Did King Daddy have a big tummy?

Of course not. He was very handsome, like me.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Tree House



Anyway, there was also a dragon.

Dinosaur.

Dinosaur? Oh, yes. It wasn't a dragon. It was a dinosaur. Living outside was a huge, fierce dinosaur.

Oh, dear. Maybe the dinosaur wasn't quite that fierce, Daddy Pig.

Sorry, George. No, the dinosaur was very gentle. It ate lots of grass.

Daddy Pig!

Oops, sorry. I was being the dinosaur.

Daddy, why is the princess called the sleepy princess?

I'm coming to that. You see, the sun set and the stars and moon came out. And everyone got very sleepy.

But the most sleepy of all was the sleepy princess. Peppa, are you sleepy?

No, Daddy. I am not sleepy at all.

But somebody is.

George, wake up. You'll miss the end of the story.

Well, Peppa might not be sleepy, but the sleepy princess certainly was. Looking at herself all day in the mirror had completely worn her out.

Let's carry you to bed. Good night.

The sleepy princess was so sleepy she had fallen fast asleep.

Thank you for that story, King Daddy.

You're welcome, Queen Mummy.

And our little prince and princess enjoyed it too.



Peppa and George are visiting Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig.

Granny Pig!


Ganny 'ig!

Hello, my little ones. Before you come in the house you must take off your muddy boots.

Yes, Granny.

Peppa, George, look what I've made. Little curtains.

Ooh.

What are the little curtains for, Granny?

It's a surprise. Do you want to see what Grandpa Pig has made for you in the garden?

Yes, please. Grandpa Pig!

Baba 'ig!

Hello, Peppa, George. Look what I've made for you. A tree house.

A tree house? For George and me?

And the little curtains are for your tree house.

Hooray!

Peppa and George love their tree house.

Thank you, Granny Pig. Thank you, Grandpa Pig.

Who wants to go inside first?

Me, me!

In you go then.

Before I go in my tree house I must take off my muddy boots.

I'm in my tree house. I'm in my tree house.

George, would you like to go in the tree house, too?

Yes, who is it?

A young pig named George would like to pay a visit. Can he come in?

As long as he takes off his muddy boots.

George, take your boots off. Then you can visit Peppa in the tree house.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Fancy Dress Party



Who is it? George?

Yes? Who is it?

It's Mummy Pig. Have you room for any more visitors?

Mmm? You have to say the secret words. Then you can come into our house.

I see. And what are the secret words?

I have to whisper them to you. The secret words

"Daddy's big tummy."

I see.

Say the secret words.

Daddy's big tummy.

That's right! Daddy's big tummy!

I think those are silly secret words.

Mummy, before you come in our house you must take off your boots.

Of course.

There's room for Daddy, too. Say the secret words, Daddy.

Can I have different secret words, please?

No.

Oh, all right. Daddy's big tummy.

That's right. You can come in now, Daddy. Take your boots off.

I don't think I can fit through the door.

That's because your tummy's too big.

I know. Daddy Pig can climb in through the top.

Peppa, George, Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are all in the tree house.

Granny, I love our tree house. I don't want to ever come out.

That's nice, Peppa. But are you sure you don't want to visit me in my house?


No, thank you, Granny.

In that case Grandpa Pig and I will just have to eat my homemade cookies all by ourselves.

Cookies! Granny Pig!

Here are my homemade cookies. But if you want to come in you have to say the secret words.

That's easy. Daddy's big tummy!

That's right.

Well I still think that those are very silly secret words.



Peppa and George are having a fancy dress party. All their friends are invited. Peppa is dressed as a fairy princess. And George is dressed as a dinosaur.

Grrr, dinosaur.

Here are Peppa's friends, Candy Cat, Suzy Sheep, Danny Dog, Rebecca Rabbit, and Pedro Pony.

Suzy is wearing her nurse's costume.

Hello, Suzy.

Hello, Mr Pig.

I'm glad the nurse has arrived. Have you just come from the hospital?

I'm not a real nurse. It's just pretend.

Very good. My my! Who have we here?

Woof! Woof! I'm a pirate. Shiver me timbers.

I'm a witch. I can turn you into a frog.

I'm a clown.

That's funny. What are you, Rebecca Rabbit?

I'm a carrot.

Fantastic. Come in. There's a fairy princess and a dinosaur waiting to meet you.

Hello, everyone.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Fancy Dress Party



Peppa's Friends: Hello, Peppa.

Hello, Suzy. I'm Princess Peppa. You must bow when you speak to me.

Hello, your majesty. I'm Nurse Suzy. Open wide and say "ah".

Ah.

I'm a clown.

Do something funny.

Rebecca, why are you dressed as a carrot?

I like carrots.

Grrr, dinosaur.

A scary dinosaur.

Peppa is admiring herself in the mirror.

Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all? You are, Peppa.

Hello, Peppa.

Hello. I'm a little fairy princess.

I'm a witch. And I've got a magic wand.

I've got a magic wand too.

I can turn you into a frog.

And I'll turn you into a frog.

Dinosaur. Grrr!

Oh, dear. George is scared of his own reflection.

Oh, silly George. Look, it's you in the mirror.

Grrr!

Children, it's time to decide who has the best fancy dress costume.

We need a judge.

Me, me!

As it's Peppa's party, maybe she should be the judge.

I'm the judge, I'm the judge. Daddy, what is a judge?


The judge decides who has the best costume.

Oh, goody!

Peppa is going to choose who has the best costume.

Suzy, can I see your costume, please?

I'm Nurse Suzy. I make people better.

Very good, Nurse Suzy. Now Danny.

I'm a pirate. Shiver me timbers.

Now Candy.

I'm a witch. I can turn you into a frog.

Well, I'm a fairy princess, and I can turn you into a frog.

Children, children.

Sorry, Mummy.

Who's next?

I'm a clown.

That's funny. And Rebecca.

I'm a carrot.

Lovely. And my little brother George is a scary dinosaur.

Grrr!

Everyone's costume is very good.

Hooray!

Now you say who the winner is.

Oh, yes. Ahem. And the winner is me!

Peppa, you can't pick yourself. You're the judge.

Oh, can't I?

You have to pick another winner.

Okay. The carrot wins.

Hooray!

Thank you.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Museum



Peppa loves fancy dress parties. Everyone loves fancy dress parties.



Peppa and her family are going to the museum.

Daddy, what is a museum?

It's a place full of interesting things that are very old.

Older than you?

Yes, even older than me.

Ooh.

Really old.

There's one room that is full of things that belonged to kings and queens from long ago.

I want to see the king and queen's room.

And there's another room with a real dinosaur.

Wow! Dinosaur. Grrr!

Hello, Mummy Pig.

Hello, Miss Rabbit.

How many tickets, please?

Two adults and two children.

Dinosaur. Grrr!

And a dinosaur.

Peppa wants to see the room full of things that belonged to kings and queens from long ago.

Wow!

Dinosaur?

But George wants to see the real dinosaur.

Don't worry, George. We will see the dinosaur next.

Peppa, these are all the things that the queen had a long time ago.


This is the queen's special chair. It's called a throne.

It's beautiful.

This is the queen's dress.

It's so pretty.

Look, Peppa. This is the queen's golden crown.

Wow! What lovely things.

Mummy, where is the queen's television?

They didn't have television then.

No television? But they did have computers.

No, they didn't have computers either.

What did they do all day?

Mummy, if I was the queen I would eat as much cake as I wanted.

Peppa imagines being a queen.

Mmm, delicious.

Is there anything else you would care for, Queen Peppa?

Yes, more cake, please.

Of course.

Come on, everyone.

Coming, Daddy.

Daddy, I'm Queen Peppa.

You must bow when you speak to me.

Oh, I'm most terribly sorry, your royal highness.

And what do you do?

I'm your daddy.

That must be very interesting.

Yes, it's very interesting.

And what room is this?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Very Hot Day



This is the dinosaur room.

The dinosaur room?

George, this is the dinosaur room.

Dinosaur.

Where is the dinosaur?

He's somewhere in the room.

I can't see him. He must be very small.

Actually, Peppa, he's very big.

Wow!

These are the bones of a real dinosaur.

Dinosaur. Grrr!

George imagines being a big dinosaur.

Roar!

It's a dinosaur! Help, help!

Roar!

The dinosaur room is George's favourite room.

My favourite room is the king and queen's room.

And it looks as if Daddy Pig is already in his favourite room.

Which room is that, Mummy?

The room with the cakes in.

Daddy Pig's favourite room is the museum cafe.

Come on, tuck in.

Oh, yes. This is a very nice room.



The sun is shining. It is a very hot day.

What a lovely hot day.

Peppa and George are wearing their boots.

They're going to jump in muddy puddles.

I love muddy puddles. Oh.


Oh, dear. The sun is so hot that the puddles have dried up.

Mummy, Daddy, the puddles are all dry. We can't jump in them.

Never mind, Peppa. It's so sunny you can play in the paddling pool instead.

Yes, the paddling pool!

First, you have to change into your swimming costumes.

Yes, Mummy.

Peppa and George are wearing their swimming costumes. Mummy Pig is wearing her swimming costume. And Daddy Pig is wearing his swimming costume.

Because it's so hot, you need sun cream.

Yuck! It's all oily and yucky.

Yuck.

What a fuss about nothing.

Yes, we all need sun cream today.

Oh.

Come on, George. Let's get some air into this paddling pool.

Daddy Pig is pumping up the paddling pool.

Easy as pie.

Peppa holds the hose, and Mummy Pig turns on the water.

Where's the water?

Peppa and George love their paddling pool.

Ice cream! Ice cream!

Miss Rabbit, the ice cream lady!

Ice cream!

On very hot days Miss Rabbit sells ice cream.

Mummy, Daddy, can George and I have an ice cream please?

Oh well, I suppose it is an especially hot day.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Chlo's Puppet Show



Hooray!

Please can I have one as well?

Everyone likes ice cream.

Hello Mummy Pig, Peppa and George.

Hello, Miss Rabbit.

What ice creams would you like?

Can I have a cone please, Miss Rabbit?

Of course you may, Peppa.

Thank you.

The same for me and one for Daddy Pig, please.

And what would young Mr George like?

Dinosaur.

A dinosaur?

Silly George. He always says dinosaur for everything.

Well, it just so happens that I do have a dinosaur shaped ice lolly.

Dinosaur, Grrr!

George, you should eat your ice lolly before it melts.

Dinosaur.

George loves his dinosaur ice lolly so much he doesn't want to eat it.

Thank you, Miss Rabbit.

Enjoy the weather.

George, I really think you should eat your ice lolly before it melts and...falls on the ground.

Oh, dear. George's dinosaur ice lolly has melted and fallen on the ground.

Never mind, George. You can share Daddy's ice cream. I'm sure he won't mind.

It is so warm Daddy Pig has fallen asleep.


Daddy Pig does look hot.

Let's tip water on Daddy to cool him down.

Good idea, Peppa.

What happened?

You were all red and hot, Daddy Pig.

So we tipped water on you.

Oh, I see. Thank you, Peppa.

Look! The puddles are back. Quick, George! Let's get our boots.

Peppa and George are wearing their boots.

Peppa and George love the hot day, but most of all they love jumping up and down in puddles.



Peppa and her family are visiting Uncle Pig and Aunty Pig and Cousin Chlo.

I expect Uncle Pig will fall asleep after lunch like he always does.

Daddy Pig, you shouldn't say such things about your own brother, especially in front of the children.

But it's true. Uncle Pig always eats too much lunch and falls asleep, snoring loudly like this.

Uh, Peppa, George, forget what I just said about Uncle Pig.

OK, Daddy.

Peppa and her family have arrived at Uncle Pig and Aunty Pig's house.

Hello, Uncle Pig and Aunty Pig.

Hello.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, big brother.

Uncle Pig is Daddy Pig's brother. Chlo Pig is Peppa and George's cousin.

Hello, Chlo.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Chlo's Puppet Show



Hello, Peppa. Hello, George. I want to show you something.

Wait for us.

This is my new puppet theatre. My daddy made it for me.

Wow!

I've made two puppets already. This one is called Chlo. Hello, I am Chlo Pig. And this one is my daddy.

Uncle Pig.

Hello, Peppa. I am Uncle Pig.

Chlo, can me and George make puppets too?

Yes.

Chlo paints the puppet's eyes.

Can I do the mouth?

OK.

My name is Peppa.

George, what puppet would you like to make?

Dinosaur.

A dinosaur?

George always says dinosaur for everything.

OK, a scary dinosaur puppet.

Chlo is making George a dinosaur puppet.

It needs pointy teeth. There, a scary dinosaur.

Grrr!

Lunchtime, everyone.

Coming. After lunch we'll do a puppet show.

Hooray!

Aunty Pig has made spaghetti for lunch.

This spaghetti is delicious.

Best spaghetti ever.

You can tell you two are brothers.

Alike in every way.


What do you mean?

We are completely different.

Peppa, George and I are going to do a puppet show.

Fantastic! Call us when you're ready.

See you later.

A puppet show? That sounds fun. Have I got time for some more spaghetti?

Could I have some more too?

The puppet show is about to begin.

Hello, my name is Chlo.

And I am Peppa.

Grrr!

It's a dinosaur!

Scary dinosaur. Eek!

I say, that's very good.

Bravo!

I am Uncle Pig.

Hello, Uncle Pig.

Hello, Peppa. Ho ho ho.

It looks just like you.

I think they've made my tummy a bit big.

Ho ho, I did enjoy my lunch.

Uncle Pig, are you going to fall asleep and snore like you always do?

What do you mean?

Daddy says you always fall asleep and snore loudly like this.

Ho ho, your daddy's right. I do snore like this.

Daddy Pig, you shouldn't have said those things about Uncle Pig.

I don't think Daddy Pig or Uncle Pig can hear you.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Daddy Gets Fit



Daddy Pig and Uncle Pig have fallen asleep.

You can tell they're brothers.

What happened?

Has the puppet show started yet?



Mummy Pig is watching a keep fit programme on television.

Come on now, that's right. Bend it, stretch it, bend it, stretch it...

I love watching telly. What's this, Mummy Pig?

It's a programme about doing exercises to keep fit.

Thank goodness I don't have to exercise. I'm naturally fit.

You don't look very fit, Daddy. Your tummy is a bit big.

I'm very fit. I'll show you. What shall I do first?

Touch your toes like this.

Easy.

Daddy, stop pretending that you can't touch your toes.

Er, I'm not pretending, Peppa.

Daddy Pig really cannot touch his toes.

Oh dear, Daddy. That's not very good.

Mmm... Maybe I should do a bit of exercise.

Yes, Daddy.

And I will start...tomorrow.

Daddy Pig, you have to start exercising now.

Oh.

Don't worry, Daddy. I will help you.

Oh, all right. Peppa, you're in charge of getting me fit. What shall I do first?



First you must do some press-ups.

Easy.

One. Two.

There.

Very good, Daddy. Now I want you to do one hundred.

One hundred?

Yes.

Come on, children. Help me make lunch.

I'll help as well.

No, Daddy. You've got one hundred press-ups to do.

Oh. One, two...

Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are in the kitchen making lunch.

Six...

Daddy Pig is still doing his press-ups.

Eight...

Daddy is doing very well.

Ten...

Yes. I do hope he's not overdoing it.

I'll go and see.

Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.

Daddy Pig! You're cheating! You should be doing press-ups.

Oh, uh, there was something interesting on the TV.

Naughty Daddy.

Maybe Daddy will have more success with my old exercise bike.

Aha. This looks like fun. I'll be able to cycle and watch TV at the same time.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Tidying Up



That's impossible. This bike is too noisy. I can't hear the TV.

You've got to get fit somehow.

I know! You can use my bicycle!

Yes, and then you'll get some fresh air as well.

Daddy Pig is going to ride on Peppa's little bicycle.

Daddy, these are the pedals, these are the brakes, and this is the bell.

Yes, yes, thank you, Peppa. I know. Byebye.

Easy as pie.

Getting fit is quite hard work.

Now I can get fit without having to pedal.

Daddy Pig is going very fast.

Oh. Maybe I'd better slow down. The brakes aren't strong enough! Help! Whoa!

Daddy Pig has been gone for a long time.

Mummy, where can Daddy be?

Don't worry, Peppa. Daddy must be really enjoying himself to be away for so long.

Daddy! Where have you been?

I whizzed all the way down the hill. Then I had to push the bike all the way back up again.

Oh, poor Daddy Pig.

Well at least I've done my exercise.

Yes, for today.

What do you mean?

You have to do some more exercise tomorrow.

What?

Daddy, to get fit you have to exercise every day.

Oh no.

But don't worry, Daddy. I'll make sure you do it.


Yes, I know you will.



Peppa and George are in their bedroom playing with their toys.

George, let's play dollies and dinosaurs.

Grrr!

What is that? It looks like a horrible monster.

Dinosaur. Grrr!

Argh, it's a dinosaur! Help! Help!

Help, help!

Daddy Pig is in the sitting room reading his newspaper. Mummy Pig is reading her book.

What are they doing?

Help, help!

Grrr!

Peppa, George, what's going on? What's all this noise? Whoa! Help!

What on earth is going on? What a lot of noise! And look at all this mess on the floor. Someone could trip over and hurt themselves.

Someone did trip over and hurt themselves.

Oh, dear. Poor Daddy Pig. Come on, children.

Let's do a bit of tidying up.

But, Mummy, we're playing dollies and dinosaurs.

You can play again when you've tidied up.

But it's all George's mess.

Is it really? So this must be one of George's lovely dresses.

No.

Well maybe some of the mess is mine.

Right. I'll help George tidy, and Mummy Pig can help Peppa.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Playground



We can have a race. Girls against boys.

Good idea. Let's see who can tidy up first. Ready, steady, go! We're winning!

No you're not. There. Oh. What's this? Teddy. I've been looking for you.

Quick, Peppa. Put Teddy in your toy basket.

There. Now these books. Lovely.

What do we have here?

Dinosaur.

That's right. It's a dinosaur book.

It's George's pop-up dinosaur book.

This is a tyrannosaurus rex.

Tyrannosaurus rex.

That's right. Oh. This is a brontosaurus.

Brontosaurus.

Yes. And this is a triceratops.

Triceratops.

Well done, George.

George loves dinosaurs.

Daddy, George, you've stopped tidying up. You'll lose the race.

Oh, yes, the race. Come on, George. Put this back on the bookshelf.

Daddy, you're very slow at tidying up. Mummy and I are going to win.

No, we're going to win. We win.

No, we win.

We all win. Look how tidy the room is.

Peppa's Family: Hooray!

What a tidy room.

Well done, everyone.

Mummy, now that we've tidied our room, can we play dollies and dinosaurs again?


Yes, you can carry on with your game now.

Yippee! Where are my dolls? Where is Mr Dinosaur?

Here they are.

Grrr! Dinosaur.

Argh! It's a dinosaur! Help! Help!

Oh, dear. The room is untidy again.

Oh.

Oh.

Well, at least it was tidy for a bit.



Peppa and George are at the playground with their friends.

Candy Cat and Pedro Pony are on the climbing frame.

Whee!

Suzy Sheep, Danny Dog and Rebecca Rabbit are playing on the slide.

Whee!

Whee!

Whee!

Whee!

Whee!

Peppa is playing on the swing.

Mummy, Mummy, push me please.

Are you ready?

Yes, I want to go really high. Whee! Higher, Mummy. Whee!

George wants to play on the swing.

Now it's your turn, George.

Hold tight.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Daddy Puts up a Picture



I want to push George.

Push George gently, Peppa.

Yes, Mummy. Hold tight, George. Whee!

Oh, dear. Peppa has pushed George too high.

George does not like being up high.

Peppa, you know George is a bit scared of heights.

Sorry, George. Let's play on the climbing frame.

Hello, Suzy. Hello, Danny.

Hello, Peppa.

Whee!

Whee!

You are doing it all wrong. This is the proper way to swing across. Stand back. Ready, steady, go! Whee! Look at me. I'm flying like a bird. Oh, I can't get out.

Peppa is stuck in the tyre.

It's not funny.

Well it does look a bit funny. We'll have to pull you out.

Peppa's friends are helping to free her.

Peppa's friends: Hooray!

Thank you, everyone.

George, do you want to play on the climbing frame?

The climbing frame is quite high. George does not like being up high.

Sorry, George. Let's play on the slide.

Yes, the slide.

Peppa loves the slide. Everyone loves the slide.

Mummy, Daddy, look at me. Ready, steady, go. Whee!

Whee!

Whee!

Whee!


Whee!

Whee!

George wants to play on the slide.

Are you sure, George? It is a bit high. All right.

I'll help you up the steps.

Oh, dear. It is a bit too high for George.

Don't worry, George. I'll slide down with you.

Daddy, you're too big to go down the slide.

Don't be silly, Peppa. I'm not too big. Stand back. Ready, steady, go.

Daddy Pig is stuck.

It's not funny.

It looks very funny, Daddy.

Mmm. I suppose it is a bit funny.

We'll have to push you down. Whee! Daddy's tummy is just like a bouncy castle.

George loves bouncing on Daddy's tummy.

George isn't afraid of heights anymore.



Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig have a new picture of Peppa and George.

We should put this lovely new picture on the wall.

Leave it to me. I am the DIY expert of the house.

Are you sure you can do it?

Of course. I'll just put a nail in the wall and hang the picture on it.

Very good. I'm just off to visit Granny and Grandpa Pig. I'll see you later. And, please don't make a mess.

Mess? Ho ho ho.

Bye.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Daddy Puts up a Picture



Goodbye.

Daddy, can we help put up the picture?

You can watch, and then you'll learn how to do it properly. First, I need a tape measure and a pencil. That is where I'm going to put the nail.

Don't break the wall, Daddy.

Ho ho ho ho ho. Now I need a hammer and a nail. Stand back, children, and watch a craftsman at work.

Daddy Pig is going to knock the nail into the wall.

Don't break the wall, Daddy.

Ho ho ho ho ho, don't be silly, Peppa. Easy as pie. Oh, it's not meant to do that.

Daddy Pig has made a big crack in the wall.

Oh, Daddy, you've broken the wall.

It's just a tiny crack. The picture will hide it.

There.

I can still see the crack, Daddy.

Yes. I'll just take the nail out and fill in the crack.

Don't make a mess, Daddy.

Ho ho, don't be silly, Peppa. It's coming out...

Oh, Daddy. Now you really have broken the wall.

Mmm.

Do you think Mummy will notice?

Yes, I think she might.

Quick, George.

What are they doing?

Daddy, we can see you.

Daddy Pig has to mend the wall before Mummy Pig comes home.

Brick, please.

First, Daddy Pig fills the hole with bricks.


There.

Next, Daddy Pig puts plaster over the bricks.

Ho ho ho, easy as pie.

Then Daddy Pig paints the wall.

Good as new.

The wall is mended.

Hooray!

But look at all the mess they have made.

Goodness me. We'd better clean up before Mummy comes back.

First, Daddy Pig quickly washes Peppa and George. Then Peppa vacuums the floor. And Daddy Pig tidies up the tools.

Mummy.

Mummy Pig is home.

Mummy.

Mummy's here.

Quick! Pretend nothing has happened.

Hello.

Hello.

What have you been doing?

Oh, nothing.

Yes, I can see you've been doing nothing. I thought you were going to put the picture up.

In all the excitement Daddy Pig has forgotten to put the picture up.

Oh.

Well, I'm no expert, but I'm sure it's quite easy.

There.

Mmm. Yes, that did look quite easy.

But when you did it, Daddy, it looked really hard.

Shush, Peppa. Don't tell anyone.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. At the Beach




Peppa and her family are going to the beach.

Peppa and George love going to the beach.

What a lot of stuff. We must be careful not to forget anything when we go.

Sunshade, beach bag, towels, buckets and spades, and a spotty ball.

Good. Now before you start playing, you need some sun cream on.

The sun is very hot so Peppa and George have to have sun cream on.

Let's try out this spotty ball. It seems to work.

What a great spotty ball.

George, you throw the ball and I will catch it.

George, catch.

Oh, dear. George is too little to catch the ball.

Never mind, George. Would you and Peppa like to have a paddle in the sea?

Yes, please, Daddy.

Let's put your water wings on. There we go.

You look very smart in your water wings, George.

My turn, my turn.

Good. Now we can play in the water.

Hooray!

Is the water cold?

It's lovely and warm.

Steady on.

You started it, Daddy Pig.

Maybe that's enough splashing.

Whee!

Daddy, I love being at the beach.

Peppa and George love the beach. Everyone loves the beach.


Peppa, George, would you like to play with your buckets and spades?

Yes, please, Mummy. Daddy, Daddy! Can we bury you in the sand?

Uh, well...

Please, Daddy.

Oh, all right.

Yippee!

Peppa and George are burying Daddy Pig in the sand.

Steady on.

There.

Now you can't escape.

My head is getting a bit hot. Can I have my straw hat?

Well, if you say please.

Please can I have my straw hat?

Yes, you may, Daddy.

That's nice. Maybe I'll just have a little sleep.

George, let's make sand castles.

Peppa and George are making sand castles.

First we put sand in the buckets like this. We turn the buckets upside down and tap them. And lift the bucket up. Hey presto!

A sand castle.

Hey presto!

Another sand castle.

Peppa, George, home time! Don't leave any stuff behind. Let's check that we haven't forgotten anything.

Towels, beach bag, sunshade, and a spotty ball.

That's everything.

I'm sure we've forgotten something.

Mmm?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mister Skinnylegs



Of course. We forgot the hat.

Daddy! We forgot Daddy!

Yes, we forgot Daddy Pig.

What?

Daddy, we almost left you behind. But George remembered you.

Well, I'm glad George remembered me.



Peppa is playing with her doll's house. George is playing too.Peppa is making a tea party for the doll family.

Here, George. I'm the mummy and daddy. You can be the children. Children, it's nearly tea time, so you must wash your hands.

George is putting the dolls to bed.

Night night.

George, why are you putting the children to bed? They're having a tea party.

George likes putting the dolls to bed.

Children, come downstairs right now, or you won't get any cake.

George isn't listening. He's too busy putting the dolls to bed.

George, if you want to play with my doll's house, you have to help with the tea party. Here, George. You can fill the teapot with water. Children, come downstairs right now. Mummy, we're coming.

George is going to fill the teapot with water.

Ooh.

George has found a spider in the sink. George wants the spider to be his friend.

Oh.

George likes the spider. The spider likes George.

Peppa loves playing tea parties.


Where are all the chocolate biscuits, Daddy? We had lots yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry, Mummy. I must have eaten them all. Ho ho ho.

Naughty Daddy.

George is putting the spider to bed.

Night night.

George, what are you doing? You have to help me with the tea party. Help! Help! Daddy, there's a spider in my bedroom.

Don't worry, Peppa.

Please, Daddy. Take it away.

No need to panic. Hello, George. Have you seen the spider?

It's too scary. Take it away.

There's no need to be afraid, Peppa. Spiders are very very small and they can't hurt you. But don't worry. Daddy will take it out of the bedroom.

Whoa! He's quite big, isn't he? Um, I'll just fetch Mummy Pig. Mummy Pig!

Hello, Mr Skinnylegs.

Peppa feels a little bit braver.

He likes being in my doll's house.

Hello, children. I hear you found a little spider. I'll take him out of the bedroom so you two can play.

Mummy, his name is Mr Skinnylegs.

Mr Skinnylegs is big, isn't he?

Peppa and George like the spider.

Night night.

George is putting the spider to bed.

No, George. He wants some tea. He doesn't want to be in bed. Are you hungry, Mr Skinnylegs? Would you like some cake?

Peppa isn't afraid of the spider anymore.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grandpa Pig's Boat



Mummy, Daddy, sit down. We are all going to have tea with Mr Skinnylegs. Who wants tea?

Me, please.

Me, please. Delicious.

Peppa loves playing tea parties.

Here's your tea, Mr Skinnylegs. What's that? You want to say hello to my daddy? Hello, Mr Daddy Pig.

That's all right, Peppa. Let Mr Skinnylegs drink his tea.

You're not scared, are you, Daddy?

No, of course not. Whoa! Not so close. Whoa!

Peppa likes Mr Skinnylegs. Everyone likes Mr Skinnylegs.



Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig are taking Peppa and George out for a day on the river.

Welcome aboard, me hearties!

Peppa, George, let's put your life jackets on.

When Peppa and George are on Grandpa Pig's boat, they must wear life jackets.

On this boat, I'm the captain.

Aye aye, Captain!

Aye aye, Captain!

When Captain Grandpa tells you all to do something, you must do it.

Unless it's something silly.

Captain Grandpa never says anything silly.

Of course not, Captain Grandpa.

George! Raise the flag! Peppa! Ring the bell!

Aye aye, Captain!

Granny Pig! Take the wheel!

Aye aye, Captain!


Full sail!

Full sail!

Maybe you should go a little slower, Grandpa Pig.

Good idea, Granny Pig. I don't want to use up all my petrol.

Grandpa, I liked it when we went fast.

Don't worry, Peppa. We'll go fast later!

Look! There's another boat!

Here's Granddad Dog. He's taking Danny Dog out for a day on the river.

Ahoy there, Granddad Dog!

Ahoy there, Grandpa Pig!

Hello, Danny!

Hello, Peppa!

Granddad Dog is Grandpa Pig's very best friend.

I'm surprised your boat is still afloat, Granddad Dog. It must be almost as old as you are.

This old boat can go faster than your rusty bucket any day, Grandpa Pig.

All right, you old sea dog. Race you.

Prepare to lose, water hog.

You two are acting like little children.

Granddad Dog called me a water hog.

You called him a sea dog first, Grandpa. You should say sorry.

Only if he says sorry first.

Granddad, say sorry to Grandpa Pig. He is your best friend.

No. He's a water hog and my boat is faster than his.

All right, sea dog. Let's race to the next bridge.

On the count of three.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Shopping



One... two...

Go!

You started too soon.

Catch me if you can, water hog!

Sea dog! Is that as fast as you can go? Can't catch me! I win!

Oh, dear. Grandpa Pig's boat has run out of petrol.

Very clever, Captain Grandpa.

Maybe I did go a bit too fast.

How will we get home?

Look, there's Granddad Dog.

Granddad Dog can tow us home.

I'm not being towed by that sea dog.

I haven't offered to tow the water hog.

Will you two ever grow up?

Grandpa, say sorry to Granddad Dog.

I'm sorry I called you a sea dog.

Granddad, say sorry to Grandpa Pig.

I'm sorry I called you a water hog.

That's nice. Granddad Dog, would you be so kind as to tow us home?

It would be my pleasure, madam. Catch this, Captain!

Aye aye, skipper!

Granddad Dog is Grandpa Pig's very best friend.

Granddad Dog is towing Grandpa Pig's boat home.

The main thing is I won the race.

Grandpa Pig.

Naughty Grandpa Pig.

Peppa. Ring the bell.

Aye aye, captain Grandpa.



Peppa and George are going shopping. Peppa and George like shopping. George loves sitting in the trolley. So does Peppa.

Daddy, can I sit in the trolley, too?

You're too big for the trolley, Peppa.

Oh.

But you can help with the shopping.

Oh, goody!

We've got four things on the list.

Tomatoes, spaghetti, onions and fruit.

I'll find it all. This way.

Peppa and George love shopping.

Peppa, first we need tomatoes.

Mmm. I can see them, I can see them. Here are the tomatoes, Mummy.

Well done, Peppa.

One, two, three, four.

Now, put them in the trolley.

I found the tomatoes.

Well done, Peppa. Tomatoes. That's one thing off the list. What's next on the list?

Spaghetti.

Pighetti.

That's right, George. But it's called spaghetti.

Pighetti.

Spaghetti is Peppa and George's favourite food.

I wonder where the spaghetti is.

I can see it. This way. Spaghetti. Look, Mummy.

Here's the spaghetti.

Well done, Peppa. Let's put the spaghetti in the trolley.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. My Birthday Party



Yes, Mummy.

Pighetti.

George, it's called "spa-ghet-ti."

Pi-ghet-ti.

What's next on the list, Peppa?

Crisps.

Crisps are not on the list.

We have plenty of crisps at home, Peppa.

Have another guess.

Mmm. I just can't remember.

Can you remember, George?

Dinosaur.

Dinosaur?

George, there aren't any dinosaurs in the supermarket.

No, George. The next thing on the list is onions.

Onions! I remember now. Here they are.

Well done.

One, two, three, four. Onions!

Very good. That's nearly everything on our list.

There's one last thing on the list.

A plant? Is that on the list?

No, George. The last thing on the list is fruit.

Oh.

Never mind, George. You can choose the fruit.

Where is the fruit?

Over there.

There are apples, and oranges, and bananas, and a very big melon.

What fruit shall we have, George? Apples?


Oranges?

Bananas? A melon!

This is the checkout where all the food is paid for.

Tomatoes, spaghetti, onions, melon, chocolate cake.

Chocolate cake?

Chocolate cake? Is that on the list?

Peppa, did you put the chocolate cake in the trolley?

No, Mummy.

George, did you put the chocolate cake in the trolley?

No.

Well I didn't put it in.

Then who did?

Uh, I thought it might be nice for pudding.

Daddy Pig!

Naughty Daddy.

Sorry. It just looked so delicious.

It does look rather yummy. Oh, let's pretend it was on the list.

Chocolate cake!

Hooray!



It is Peppa's birthday. It is very early in the morning.

It's my birthday. George, wake up. It's my birthday. I'm going to have a party, and Daddy is doing a magic show. Quick, George. Let's wake Mummy and Daddy up.

Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are still fast asleep.

Wake up, it's my birthday! Wake up!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. My Birthday Party



What time is it?

It's very late.

It's five o'clock in the morning.

Yes, the whole day is going.

Okay, let's get your birthday started.

Yippee!

Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and George are giving Peppa her birthday present.

Happy birthday, Peppa.

Ooh, what is it? A doll's dress. I can put it on Teddy.

Thank you, everyone.

You're welcome, Peppa. I didn't know Teddy was a girl teddy.

Oh, Daddy, of course Teddy is a girl. I love my new dress. Thank you, everyone.

You're welcome, Teddy. Don't get it dirty.

Do you know what's happening next, Peppa?

Yes, my friends are coming for my birthday party, and Daddy is doing a magic show.

No one will know the magician is your daddy.

You'll introduce me as The Amazing Mysterio.

The Mazy Mistio.

Yes, The Amazing Mysterio.

Daddy's been practising his magic tricks all week.

My friends are here! Yippee!

Here are Peppa's friends, Candy Cat, Suzy Sheep, Danny Dog, Rebecca Rabbit, and Pedro Pony

Hello, everyone.

Peppa's Friends: Happy birthday, Peppa.

Come on, children. The party's starting.

Hooray!

Daddy Pig is going to do a magic show.



Peppa, remember what you have to say? Ladies and gentlemen, introducing The Amazing Mysterio.

Okay, Daddy.

Ladies and gentlemen, uh, it's Magic Daddy.

Hooray!

For my first trick...Abracadabra.

Wow, it's Teddy!

For my next trick I need a helper from the audience.

Me, me, me, me!

I just need one. Young lady, you put your hand up first. Can you tell the audience your name?

Suzy Sheep.

Okay, Suzy. Here are three balls, a red one, a blue one, and a yellow one.

Okay.

You have to secretly choose one while my back is turned.

Okay.

Have you chosen one?

Yes.

Abracadabra, you chose yellow.

No.

Abracadabra...blue.

No.

Abracadabra...red.

Yes! It is red.

Hooray!

Silly Magic Daddy. You said all three colours.

Shush, Peppa. Don't tell anyone. Would you like one more trick?

Yes, please.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Daddy's Movie Camera



Close your eyes. No looking. Say the magic words, "Abracadabra."

Abracadabra.

Open your eyes.

Hooray! My banana birthday cake.

Blow the candles out, Peppa.

Peppa's Friends: Hooray! Happy birthday, Peppa.

Thank you, everyone. This is my best birthday ever.



Mr Zebra, the postman, is delivering a parcel to Peppa's house.

Parcel for you, Mr Pig.

Thank you, Mr Zebra. Goodbye. Look. I just got a parcel in the post. Can anyone guess what's inside?

Dinosaur.

Oh, George. You always say dinosaur for everything.

The parcel is far too small to have a dinosaur inside.

Mmm... I think it's a... a new toy.

You're very close.

I know what it is. Your new camera. A new toy for Daddy Pig.

That's right! It's a movie camera. We can make movies with it and watch them on our television.

Can I use it first, Daddy?

It's a bit too difficult for children to use. Even I need to read the instructions. Mmm... It's a bit harder than I thought.

Suzy Sheep's mummy has a movie camera. She switches it on like this.

Oh. Well done, Peppa.


Thank you for purchasing the Movie . I am eager and ready to shoot your first movie.

Is there a way to turn that voice off?

I'm not sure.

Thank you for purchasing the Movie .

On Suzy's camera, you just press this button to stop it talking.

Thank you for purchasing...

Now it won't talk anymore.

Well done, Peppa.

What shall I film first?

Film me!

OK, Peppa.

Hello. I'm Peppa Pig.

Come on, everyone.

Hello. I'm Peppa Pig. Again! Again!

OK.

Hello! I'm Peppa Pig. Again! Hello. I'm Peppa Pig. Again! Again!

Maybe we should film something new.

I know! Daddy Pig must leave the room and we'll make a movie to show him.

This way!

Daddy Pig has to wait in the kitchen while Mummy Pig, Peppa and George make a secret movie.

No peeking, Daddy Pig. We all have to do something. George, do you want to go first?

Are you ready? Can I come in and see the movie?

Finished! You can come in now! George has made a movie and so has Peppa.

Let's see George's movie first.

Dinosaur! Grrr!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. School Play



George is pretending to be a dinosaur.

Grrr!

That's a very scary dinosaur.

Oh dear, George is frightened.

Don't be frightened, George. That's not a real dinosaur on TV. It's you.

Grrr! Dinosaur!

Now, let's see Peppa's movie.

Ho ho ho.

Who is that meant to be?

I am Daddy Pig! Ho ho ho.

I see.

My tummy is very big because I eat a lot of cookies.

My tummy is not big! But it is true that I like cookies.

And the more you eat, the bigger your tummy gets!

OK, what's next?

This is my sweet little brother George. This is Mummy Pig. This is me.

And this is the real Daddy Pig.



Peppa's playgroup are going to put on a play.

The Little Red Riding Hood.

Hooray!

All the children have parts in the play. They have to practice at home. Peppa is going to be Little Red Riding Hood. Mummy Pig has made her costume. Daddy Pig is helping Peppa practice.

Okay, Peppa, what do you say?

I'm Little Red Riding Hood.


Very good. Then what?

Um...

I'm going to visit my grandma.

I'm going to visit my grandma.

Bravo, Peppa!

Danny Dog is going to play the Big Bad Wolf.

Granddad Dog and Mummy Dog are helping him practice.

I'm the Big Bad Wolf.

Try not to laugh, Danny.

You should be a bit scarier. Try it like this,

Danny. I'm the Big Bad Wolf! I'm going to eat you all up!

You see?

Yes, that was really scary.

Pedro Pony is going to play the Hunter. He will rescue Peppa from the Big Bad Wolf.

Um... I'm the Hunter and...

Pedro is a bit shy.

You say: "I'm going to chase you away, you Big Bad Wolf!"

Go away, naughty wolf.

Very good, Pedro.

Rebecca Rabbit is going to be the Grandma.

What do I say, Mummy?

Let's see. At the start of the play you get locked in a cupboard by the Big Bad Wolf. Then right at the end of the play you are rescued by the Hunter. And you say: "Thank you."

Thank you.

Very good, Rebecca.

Everyone has come to see the school play.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our play, "The Little Red Riding Hood". First, let us meet the actors.




	 




	 



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Bubbles




Peppa and George are drinking orange juice.

What noisy little piggies.

George, look at all the tiny bubbles. I can make bigger bubbles.

Peppa is blowing bubbles in her drink.

Bubble!

George wants to blow bubbles too.

Peppa, George, you really shouldn't play with your food.

Sorry, Daddy.

Peppa, if you like bubbles, why don't you play with your bubble mixture?

Yes! My bubble mixture! George! Let's blow bubbles in the garden.

Peppa is showing George how to blow bubbles.

First, dip the stick in the mixture. Then, take a big breath and blow.

Bubble!

George, now it's your turn.

Dip the stick in the mixture, hold it up, take a big breath... and blow!

George is trying really hard, but he is running out of breath.

Achoo!

George, you didn't blow hard enough.

I know a way George can make bubbles. Dip the stick in the mixture, then lift it up, and wave it around.

Bubble!

It's even better if you run along.

Wait for me!

George is having fun making bubbles, and Peppa is having fun popping them.


I love bubbles!

Oh dear. The bubble mixture is all used up.

Daddy, Mummy! There's no more bubble mixture!

Don't worry, Peppa. I have an idea.

Mummy Pig. Bring me a bucket, please.

Yes, Daddy Pig.

Peppa, bring me some soap.

Yes, Daddy Pig.

George, bring me my old tennis racket.

A bucket, some soap, a tennis racket? What is Daddy Pig doing?

First, I need some water.

Then the soap.

And now the tennis racket, please. Thank you.

Now watch this.

Wow!

Daddy Pig has made his own bubble mixture.

Come on, everyone.

Be careful, Daddy Pig. Don't slip and fall.

I'll be fine. Whoa.

Are you okay, Daddy Pig?

Yes, I'm fine.

Achoo!

Wow!

Daddy Pig has made the biggest bubble ever.

Oh dear. I've spilt all my bubble mixture.

Now we can't make any more bubbles.

But we can play jumping in muddy puddles.

Look.

Daddy Pig's bubble mixture has made a big muddy puddle.

Hooray!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Emily Elephant



Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Look. The bubble mixture has made the puddle all bubbly.

Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy, bubbly puddles.

Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy, bubbly puddles.



Peppa and her friends are going to playgroup today.

The children each have their own hook to hang their coats on.

Today we have a new pupil, Emily Elephant.

Hello, Emily!

Hello.

Emily is a bit shy.

Who would like to show Emily where to hang her coat?

Me! Me! Me! Me!

We just need one. Peppa, can you show Emily where to hang her coat?

Yes, Madame Gazelle. We each have our own coat hooks. This one is for you, Emily.

Emily is hanging her coat on her very own coat hook.

Now, Emily, what would you like to do today? Painting, clay or building blocks?

Um, I don't know. Maybe building blocks.

And everyone else: painting, clay or building blocks?

Building blocks!


My goodness! Building blocks are popular today.

Everyone wants to sit next to Emily Elephant.

Emily, you put one block on top of another. Like this.

It's better if you put them side by side.

No, this way, Emily.

This is the right way, Emily.

No, Emily. Like this.

You are all being very helpful. But Emily, how would you play with the blocks?

Um, I'm not very sure. I might do it like this.

Wow!

Emily Elephant is good at building blocks. It is playtime.

Hurray!

Emily, would you like to play outside with the others?

Yes, please.

Can someone show Emily where we play?

Yes, Madame Gazelle.

At playtime, Peppa and her friends play in the school garden.

Can't catch me!

What a lot of noise.

Let's see who is the loudest.

OK. I'll go first. Squeak! Squeak!

That was quite loud. Now it is Zoe Zebra's turn.

Brrr!

Now Suzy Sheep.

Baa!

Now Danny Dog.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Polly's Holiday



Woof! Woof!

That was very loud.

My turn! Meow!

My turn! Neigh!

My turn! Oink!

Peppa is the loudest.

Emily, you try.

I'm not too sure.

Please, Emily.

OK. I'll try. Baraag!

My goodness! That was loud.

Wow!

Do it again!

Baraag!

Emily is not shy anymore.

Emily, would you like to play my favourite game?

What is your favourite game?

Jumping in muddy puddles.

That's my favourite game, too.

Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles. Emily loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

This looks like fun. Yippee!

Madame Gazelle loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Emily, have you enjoyed your first day at our playgroup?

Yes, Madame Gazelle.

And I see you've made lots of new friends.

Yes.


Emily Elephant is my friend.

And Emily is my friend.

And mine.

And mine.

And mine.

And mine.

And mine. And mine. And mine.

Emily, who do you like best?

Um, I like Suzy and Danny, and Zoe and Rebecca, and Pedro, and Peppa!



Granny and Grandpa Pig are going on holiday. They are bringing Polly Parrot to Peppa's house so Peppa and George can look after her.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Grandpa Pig. Hello, Granny Pig.

Polly is very excited about her holiday with Peppa and George.

Hello, Polly.

Hello, Polly.

Polly Parrot copies everything that is said.

What's in Polly's suitcase, Granny?

This is Polly's food. George, can you guess what Polly likes to eat best?

Chocolate cake.

No, not chocolate cake. Polly likes birdseed.

Birdseed.

Can I feed her, Granny Pig? Can I feed her?

Yes.

It's very important not to give Polly too much food.

Yes, Grandpa Pig.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Teddy's Day Out



Grandpa, can Polly come out of the cage?

Yes, but you must keep all the doors and windows closed so Polly doesn't fly away.

Yes, Grandpa Pig.

Goodbye, Peppa. Goodbye, George.

Goodbye, Granny Pig. Goodbye, Grandpa Pig.

Goodbye, Granny Pig. Goodbye, Grandpa Pig.

Would you like a cup of tea?

Would you like a cup of tea?

George has got Polly's birdseed.

George, that is too much birdseed. Polly will grow very big and burst like a balloon. Pop!

Burst like a balloon. Pop!

What's that noise?

Ice cream! Ice cream. Hurray!

Oh, dear. George has forgotten to close the door.

Ice cream. Ice cream.

It is Miss Rabbit, the ice cream lady.

Hello, Mummy Pig.

Hello, Miss Rabbit. Four ice creams, please.

Thank you, Miss Rabbit.

George, you forgot to close the door. Polly will have flown away.

Don't worry, Peppa. I'm sure Polly is still inside.

Polly's not here.

Oh.

We've lost Polly. Grandpa and Granny are going to be very sad.

Maybe we should try the garden. Look! What's that?

What has Mummy Pig seen in the garden?

It's Polly.


Hurray!

But, Daddy. How are we going to get Polly down from the tree?

Don't worry, Peppa. I'll rescue Polly.

Come on, Polly.

Would you like a cup of tea?

Oh no. Polly has flown higher up the tree.

Oh, dear.

Be careful, Daddy. Don't fall out of the tree like you always do.

Don't worry, Peppa. I'll be very careful.

Come on, Polly.

Birdseed.

I wonder where George is going.

George has got Polly's birdseed. Polly loves to eat birdseed.

George has got Polly down from the tree.

Hurray!

What's that noise?

Daddy Pig's mobile phone is ringing.

What?

Hello. Oh, Granny Pig.

Hello, Daddy Pig. Please may I talk to Polly?

Yes, of course.

Hello, Polly. Are you having a nice holiday?

Hello, Polly. Are you having a nice holiday?



Peppa and her family are going out for the day.

Daddy Pig has made a picnic.

Peppa, George, have you got your stuff ready?

Yes, I'm taking Teddy.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Teddy's Day Out



Dinosaur.

If you take your toys, you must look after them.

Yes, Mummy.

Are we all ready?

Yes, Daddy Pig.

Then let's go.

Dinosaur!

George has left Mr Dinosaur behind.

Oh, George. You should take more care of Mr Dinosaur.

Dinosaur.

Are we all absolutely sure we haven't forgotten anything else?

Yes, Daddy Pig.

Teddy! I've left Teddy!

Where did you leave Teddy?

I think on the kitchen table.

Peppa, you really must take more care of Teddy.

Teddy!

Here we go again. All ready?

Yes, Daddy Pig.

Here we go

This is the picnic area.

We're here.

Hurray!

Ah, I love this picnic spot. It's so quiet and peaceful.

It is Zo Zebra with her daddy, Mr Zebra, the postman.

Hello, Mr Zebra. Have you got our post?

Ho ho. No deliveries today. It's my day off.


We're having a picnic lunch.

So are we.

I know. Why don't we make one big picnic?

Yes.

What a splendid picnic!

Please may George and I leave the table and play with Zo?

Yes, Peppa.

Zo, I've got my teddy.

I've got my monkey. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

Dinsoaur, grrr.

I've got a toy picnic set. Let's play picnics.

Oh, it's the ducks. They always turn up when we have a picnic.

We've got pretend orange juice.

And we've got pretend cake.

It's pretend cake. It's very nice.

Oh, dear. I do not think the ducks want pretend cake.

Oh, well. That means there's more for Monkey, Mr Dinosaur and Teddy.

Mmm, delicious.

Monkey says, "The best cake ever."

Peppa, George, home time.

Bye bye, Zo.

Bye bye.

Are we all ready?

Yes, Daddy Pig.

Home time for us too, Zo.

Yes, Daddy. Cups, plates, Monkey, Teddy. Oh, no. You shouldn't be here, Teddy.

Peppa has forgotten her teddy, again.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mysteries



Peppa and her family are home.

Ah, that's enough driving for one day. All I want to do now is relax, put my feet up and watch some...

Teddy! I forgot Teddy!

Oh, Peppa. Now Daddy Pig will have to drive all the way back to the picnic spot.

Uh, yes, of course.

It's Mr Zebra, the postman.

I thought it was your day off today, Mr Zebra.

It is my day off, but Zo's got a very special delivery for a Miss Peppa Pig.

Here you are, Peppa.

What is it?

It's Teddy!

You left Teddy behind. So we brought him home.

Thank you, Zo.

Teddy certainly has had an exciting day out, but Peppa, you really must take better care of him.

Yes, Mummy. You are a very naughty teddy. You must promise not to wander off ever again.

Sorry, Peppa. I promise.



Peppa and her family are watching their favourite television programme, Detective Potato.

I am Detective Potato, the world famous detective.

Ooh.

Please help me, Mr Detective. I cannot find my flower anywhere.

Mmm, your flower is on the top of your head.

Oh, thank you, Mr Detective.

That was easy. I could do that.


I'm sure you could, Peppa.

Daddy, when I grow up I want to be a famous detective.

George wants to be a detective too.

If you're going to be detectives, you'll each need a hat. Detectives always wear hats. Now you look like two proper detectives.

And we need one of those funny things that makes everything look big.

A magnifying glass. I think we've got one in the kitchen drawer. Here we are. A real magnifying glass.

Wow. How does it work?

You hold it in front of things and they look bigger.

The magnifying glass makes the little fish look big.

Can I have a go? Wow!

The magnifying glass makes George's eyes look very big.

Now what you detectives need is a mystery to solve.

Daddy, what's a miss-story?

A mystery is something detectives are good at sorting out. Like finding things that are lost.

I know. We can find George's toy dinosaur. That's always getting lost.

Dinosaur.

Mr Dinosaur is not lost.

Oh. What about your glasses, Daddy? You're always losing them

Not today. I'm wearing my glasses.

It's not fair. There aren't any miss-stories.

Would you like me to make you a mystery?

Yes, please.

Daddy Pig is going to make a mystery.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. George's Friend



Now, what's on the table?

The little fish, Teddy, a jack-in-the-box, and Mr Dinosaur.

That's right. Now look very hard and try to remember them all.

The little fish, Teddy, a jack-in-the-box, and Mr Dinosaur.

Have you remembered them?

Yes.

OK, you just have to go outside for a moment.

I'll call you when I'm ready.

It sounds like Daddy is going upstairs. And now he is coming down again.

All right. You can come back inside now. One thing is missing from the table. Do you know what?

Mr Dinosaur is there, little fish, jack-in-the-box.

So who's missing?

Um, Teddy!

That's right. Teddy's gone.

Well done, Peppa and George.

It was quite easy for us. We are famous detectives.

Ah, but that's only half the mystery. Where has Teddy gone?

Oh, I don't know.

What are those little things on the floor?

They're cake crumbs.

The magnifying glass makes the cake crumbs easy to see.

I wonder if Teddy has been eating cake.

And the crumbs lead this way. Teddy's been eating a lot of cake.

The crumbs lead into Peppa and George's bedroom.


Oh, the crumbs have stopped. How can we find Teddy?

Ask me some questions. But I will only answer yes or no.

OK. Um? Is Teddy in this room?

Yes.

Is Teddy in George's bed?

No.

Is Teddy somewhere high up?

Yes.

Teddy's in my bed!

Hurray!

The mystery is solved.

Do you still want to be a detective when you grow up, Peppa?

Being a detective is quite hard. Next time I want to be the one who makes the mysteries. Like you did, Daddy.



Peppa and her friends are at the playground.

Peppa, Suzy and Danny are on the roundabout.

Are you all ready?

Ready.

Then let's go.

Whee!

Faster. Faster.

Whee!

George is a bit too little for the roundabout. He is playing on the swing.

Here is Rebecca Rabbit with her little brother, Richard Rabbit.

Hello, everyone.

Hello.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. George's Friend



Can I come on the roundabout too?

Hop on, Rebecca.

Let's go really really fast.

Richard Rabbit wants to go on the roundabout too.

Oh, if Richard gets on, it means we can't go fast.

Richard can play with George.

Richard, would you like to play with George?

No.

George has a dinosaur just like yours. Let's go and see.

Richard Rabbit is the same age as George.

Richard wants to see George's dinosaur.

Grr, dinosaur.

George, can Richard play with your dinosaur?

No.

Richard, can George play with your dinosaur?

No.

George and Richard do not want to share their dinosaurs.

George, it will be much more fun if you share.

That was really nice of George.

Dinosaur.

George does not like sharing.

Richard, let George hold the dinosaurs now.

Richard does not like sharing either.

What's all this crying about?

George and Richard always cry when they play together.

They're just too little to play properly.


Can you two big girls teach them to play together?

Of course.

We can help them make sand castles.

Good idea. Let's go to the sandpit.

George and Richard love the sandpit.

George, Richard, today we are going to make sand castles.

First, we fill the buckets with sand.

We turn the buckets over and give them a little tap.

Now, we lift the buckets.

Hey presto.

Richard has made a sand castle.

Hey presto.

And George has made a sand castle.

You see, playing together is fun.

Oh, dear. This game has not gone very well.

It was your brother's fault. He broke George's sand castle.

Your brother broke my brother's sand castle first.

Now, now. You two big girls are meant to be teaching Richard and George to play nicely together.

That's right. We're big girls.

And George and Richard are too little to play together properly.

Mmm. I've got an idea. George, what's your most favourite thing in the whole playground?

Seesaw.

George loves the seesaw.

Seesaw.

It is a bit difficult to play on a seesaw on your own.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mr Scarecrow



Richard wants to play on the seesaw.

Seesaw.

Seesaw.

Seesaw.

Look. George and Richard are playing together.

Seesaw.

Seesaw.

Seesaw.

Seesaw.

George likes Richard. Richard likes George.

George and Richard like playing together.

Seesaw, seesaw. Seesaw, seesaw.



Peppa and George are playing at Granny and Grandpa Pigs' house today.

Hello, Grandpa Pig.

Papa 'ig.

Hello, Peppa. Hello, George.

Grandpa, what are you doing?

I'm making a flower garden.

Ooh!

These seeds will grow into beautiful flowers. I drop the seeds on the ground. Then I cover the seeds with earth. Oh, where have they gone?

The seeds have disappeared.

That's strange. I'm sure I put some seeds here.

Yes, Grandpa. We saw you.

Well, they're not here now. Oh, well. I'll just have to use some more. As I was saying, I simply drop the seeds on the ground.

A little bird is eating Grandpa Pig's flower seeds.


Oy, get off my seeds! So that's where all my seeds went.

Into the little bird's tummy.

Two more little birds are eating Grandpa Pig's seeds.

Oh, look.

Shoo, shoo.

What's all this noise?

Granny Pig, the birds are eating all my flower seeds.

So we're chasing the birds away.

There's no point chasing them. They'll just come back again. Look. We need a scarecrow.

What's a scarecrow?

A scarecrow is a straw man that scares birds away.

What a good idea, Granny Pig. I'll make one.

Come on, everyone.

Bye bye, little birds. We're going to make a scarecrow.

This is Grandpa Pig's garden shed.

There'll be plenty of things in here to make a scarecrow. First, we need two sticks and some string.

We'll find them.

Peppa has found some sticks. George has found some string.

Good. I'll tie the sticks together to make the body.

Granny Pig has found some straw and an old sack.

Lovely. I'll put the straw in the sack to make the head. Now the scarecrow needs something to wear.

Here's a bag of old clothes.

Ooh!

George has found a dress.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Windy Autumn Day



Silly George. Mr Scarecrow doesn't want to wear a dress.

Peppa has found a coat.

Very good, Peppa.

George has found a hat.

Very good, George.

Mr Scarecrow needs a face.

That's right. Would you and George like to paint a face?

Yes, please.

George paints the eyes and nose.

Peppa paints the mouth.

Fantastic.

Mr Scarecrow is ready.

Hurray!

The little birds are looking for Grandpa Pig's flower seeds.

Look, the little birds are back.

Don't worry, Peppa. Mr Scarecrow will scare them off.

It worked. Mr Scarecrow has scared the little birds away.

Hurray!

Good. Now my flower seeds will not be eaten.

Oh, Grandpa. The birds look very sad.

Yes, they must be hungry. That's why I brought this.

What's that, Granny?

It's a bird feeder. Grandpa, may I have some seeds, please?

Come on, birdies. Lunch time. Now the birdies have their own seeds to eat.

Hurray! The little birds are happy again.


Peppa is glad that Grandpa Pig's seeds will not be eaten. But she is even more glad that the little birds will not be hungry.


Today Peppa is going to the park.

It's freezing cold.

It is cold. Brrr.

Quick. Let's get our warm clothes on.

Cold days, Peppa and her family wear their hats and scarves and coats.

I'll put the roof up.

Oo, and let's get the heating on.

Everyone nice and warm?

Yes, Daddy Pig.

Then let's go.

This is the park.

We're here.

Hurray!

Mummy, why are all the leaves red and yellow?

It's autumn time, Peppa.

In the autumn, it gets a bit colder and the leaves change colour.

It's quite windy. Let's play a game to keep warm.

My turn.

Oh, it's not meant to go that way.

The wind is blowing the ball along.

The ball is in the pond.

Mmm. I'll just use this stick to reach it.

Just a bit further, Daddy.

Be careful, Daddy Pig.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Time Capsule



Don't worry. I've almost got it.

Whoa!

Daddy, is the water cold?

A little bit.

The wind has blown the ball out of the pond.

That's lucky.

Yes. What a stroke of luck.

It's getting even windier. Hold on to your hats.

Oh no! The wind has blown George's hat off.

Don't worry, George. Daddy Pig will catch your hat.

Quick, Daddy!

Look. It's in that little tree.

Mmm. I'll just climb up and get it.

The tree's much too thin to take your weight, Daddy Pig.

So, how can we get George's hat?

Simple. I'll give the tree a little shake.

Mmm. Maybe if I shake it a bit harder.

I thought that sort of thing only happened to me.

It's not funny.

It is a bit funny, Mummy.

I suppose it is a bit funny.

Where's George's hat?

It's on your head.

Here's your hat, George. Hold on to it this time.

The wind is blowing all the leaves off the trees.

Look at me! I'm leaning into the wind.

The wind is strong enough to hold Peppa up.


The wind is strong enough to hold George up.

Daddy, have a go.

Uh, I'm a bit too heavy.

Come on, Daddy. It's really fun.

Oh, all right.

The wind is strong enough to hold up Daddy Pig.

I say, this is fun.

Come on, Mummy Pig. Give it a try.

But if the wind stops, I'll fall over.

The wind won't just stop.

The wind has stopped.

It's not funny.

It is a bit funny.

Now the wind has stopped, what can we do?

Mmm, what's your favourite game?

Jumping up and down in muddy puddles!

But there aren't any puddles. Just lots of boring, dry leaves.

And what do you do with dry leaves?

I don't know.

Jump up and down in them!

Daddy Pig loves jumping up and down in leaves.

Peppa loves jumping up and down in leaves.

Everyone loves jumping up and down in leaves.

This is the best autumn day ever.



Peppa and her friends are at their playgroup.

Today we are going to make a time capsule.

What's a time capsule?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Time Capsule



A time capsule is something that will show people in the future how we lived.

How?

We'll put special things in this box and then we'll bury it in the school garden.

Will it grow?

No, Suzy. It will remain in the ground for many years.

Now, what things should we put inside?

A comic.

Very good, Peppa.

Music.

Very good, Suzy.

A toy.

A coin.

Stamps.

A carrot.

You do like carrots, don't you, Rebecca?

Yes.

All those are excellent things to show our daily lives.

Madame Gazelle, what will the future be like?

What do you think it will be like?

I think in the future I will live on the moon, and all my friends will come to visit.

And I will fly a space rocket.

Hello.

Now we'll record a message for the people of the future.

Say "Hello" to the future.

Hello to the future. You're probably all living on the moon now.

And going on holiday to Mars.


And flying around in space rockets.

Wonderful.

It is nearly home time and all the parents have arrived.

Mummy, Daddy, we've made a time capsule.

Ah, Daddy Pig. You're just in time to help us dig a hole.

Yes, of course.

Daddy Pig is digging a hole in the school garden for the time capsule.

There.

Can we dig it up now?

It will remain in the ground for many years.

Oh, but I can't wait that long.

Peppa, you are just like your daddy when he was little.

Am I?

Yes, I remember when I was his teacher.

Did you teach my daddy?

Yes, I taught all of your mummies and daddies. Didn't I?

Yes, Madame Gazelle.

When your mummies and daddies were little, they made a time capsule too.

Yes, we did. We buried it next to a little tree.

Can we dig it up?

Yes. I think we buried it over here.

Oh, I thought it was a much smaller tree.

It was a long time ago. The tree has grown a bit since then.

I've found something.

It's our old time capsule.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Rock Pools



Hurray!

I can't wait to open it.

Stand back, children.

Yes, Madame Gazelle.

What do we have here?

An old comic.

That was my favourite comic.

A tin toy.

My favourite toy.

Music.

My favourite record.

And a very old carrot.

That's mine.

What a good choice, Mummy.

And a videotape of your mummies and daddies when they were little.

Ooh!

Who's the little piggy in the glasses?

Aw, that's Daddy Pig.

Oh, and that's me.

Hello to the future.

What a squeaky voice you have.

You're probably living on the moon now.

Silly little Daddy Pig.

Making time capsules is such fun. And finding them is even better.



Peppa and George are going to the seaside with Granny and Grandpa Pig.

Peppa and George love the seaside.

Oh. Where's the sand gone?


There isn't any sand on this beach, Peppa.

No sand? But we wanted to make sand castles.

Peppa and George love making sand castles.

Now, now, George. Don't be upset. There are lots of exciting things to do on this rocky beach.

Like what?

When the sea goes out, it leaves little pools of water in amongst the rocks.

They're called rock pools.

And in every rock pool there's something special that the sea has left behind.

Oo, I can see something glittering.

It's a coin. Wow!

Maybe it's a pirate's treasure.

Let's make a collection of all the things we find.

Yes, we'll put them in George's bucket.

What surprise is waiting in this pool?

There's nothing special in this one.

There's always something, Peppa. Look closer.

Oo, there is something.

Yes, it's a...crab! Ah!

The crab is pinching Grandpa Pig's finger.

Ouch!

Naughty Mr Crab.

Look, George. Mr Crab is walking sideways.

George is pretending to be a crab.

Peppa wants to be a crab, too.

We're naughty crabs. Pinch, pinch, pinch.

Pinch, pinch, pinch.

Help, there are two naughty crabs trying to pinch me.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Recycling



Pinch, pinch, pinch.

We're naughty crabs. Pinch, pinch, pinch.

Shoo, shoo, shoo, you naughty crabs. Go back to your little rock pools.

Yes, let's look in more rock pools.

What can you see?

A seashell.

Can you hear the sea in it?

What do you mean?

If you put a shell to your ear you can hear the sea.

Wow! I can hear the sea.

I love my seashell.

George, can you find a seashell too?

Shell.

That's not a shell.

Oh.

Peppa's right. That's not a shell. George has found a fossil.

What's a fossil?

A fossil is the remains of an animal that lived long ago, when there were dinosaurs.

Dinosaur. Grrr!

Rock pools are such fun.

Yes, they're fun for us, but not for this little fish.

A fish. Where?

Poor little fish. She's trapped.

Oh.

Oh.

The little fish says she wants to go back to the sea.

Maybe you could use your bucket to rescue her.


Yes.

Peppa is rescuing the little fish in her bucket.

Don't worry, Mrs Fish. You'll soon be back with your friends.

Bye bye, Mrs Fish.

Bye bye.

I love rock pools.



Mr Bull, the bin man, is collecting the rubbish.

It is early morning, so Mr Bull tries to be as quiet as he can.

But Mr Bull is not very good at being quiet.

Peppa and George are finishing their breakfast.

What's that noise?

It's Mr Bull, the bin man.

Hello, Mr Bull.

Hello, everyone. Must be off. Lots of rubbish to collect.

Bye.

Bye.

Mr Bull has emptied the rubbish bin for us.

Good. Let's clear up the breakfast things.

Can we help, Mummy?

Yes, you can.

Let's throw this empty bottle in the bin.

Peppa, stop.

What?

We don't put bottles in the rubbish bin. They can be recycled.

What does that mean?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Boat Pond



All the things we can't use again we put in the rubbish bin for Mr Bull.

But all the things that can be used again are put in these recycle boxes.

The red one is for newspapers, the blue one is for tin cans, and the green one is for bottles.

Peppa, you have a bottle. So which box does it go in?

Um, the green one.

Yes.

This is fun.

Now, it's George's turn. Can you find a newspaper for the red box?

George wants to recycle Daddy Pig's newspaper.

I haven't finished with my newspaper just yet, George. You can have it in a minute.

Oh, all right. Here you are, George.

Newspapers go in the red box, George.

Now that we have collected enough things, we can go to the recycle centre.

Hurray! Let's go!

Mummy Pig has the bottles, Peppa has the tin cans, and George has the newspapers.

Is everybody ready?

Yes, Daddy Pig.

Then let's go.

Recycle, recycle, we're going to recycle. Tin cans, bottles, newspapers. Recycle, recycle, we're going to

recycle.

This is Miss Rabbit's recycle centre.

We're here.

Hurray!

Hello there!

Hello, Miss Rabbit.


Have you come to do some recycling?

Yes, we have.

Jolly good. Carry on.

What's Miss Rabbit doing?

She's recycling all the rusty old cars.

Wow.

Who can tell me which bin the bottles go in?

The green one.

That's right.

And the cans go in the blue one.

Well done, Peppa.

George wants to recycle the newspapers.

OK, George, you can do the newspapers.

There. That's enough recycling for one day.

Yes, let's go home.

Oh, where's our car gone?

Peppa's car has disappeared.

Stand back.

Miss Rabbit is recycling Peppa's car.

Stop! That's our car.

What? Is it really?

Yes.

Our car isn't old and rusty.

Silly me. I just love recycling.

Yes, so do we. But we also love our little car.

Yes, and our little car loves us too, don't you?



The ducks are swimming in their pond. They are very happy. Here are Peppa, George, Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Boat Pond



Hello, Ducks.

The ducks want some bread.

Sorry, Mrs Duck. We haven't got any bread today.

We've got something much more fun.

Peppa has brought her toy boat. And George has brought his toy boat.

Let's wind your boat up, George.

George's boat works with clockwork.

Quick, George. Put the boat in the pond before the clockwork runs out.

George loves his clockwork boat.

Mummy, can you wind my boat up?

Your boat doesn't need winding up, Peppa.

Peppa's boat is a sailboat. The wind makes it go along.

I don't like my boat. It doesn't do anything.

That's because there isn't any wind today.

Maybe it just needs a little help. I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your boat along!

Hurray! It went really fast.

Peppa loves her sailboat.

Here is Peppa's friend, Suzy Sheep.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Suzy. We're playing with our boats.

I've got my speedboat.

Is it clockwork?

No, it has batteries.

Suzy's speedboat uses batteries to make it go.

What a great speedboat.

Sorry, Mrs Duck.

Here is Danny Dog with Granddad Dog.

Hello, everyone.


Hello, Danny.

My granddad has made me this paddle boat.

I'll say, that's impressive. How does it work?

It's steam-powered. I just push this little lever.

Wow!

What a fantastic paddle boat!

Here is Rebecca Rabbit with her mummy.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Rebecca. We're playing with our boats

I wish I had a boat.

Rebecca Rabbit does not have a boat.

I've got an idea. Luckily I brought my newspaper along. I just need one page. Which page can we lose? News? Sport? Ah, fashion.

Not the fashion page.

OK, I'll use the business page. When I was a little piggy, I use to fold newspaper like this.

What is Daddy Pig doing?

To make a paper boat.

Daddy Pig has made a paper boat.

Thank you, Mr Pig.

George wants a paper boat too.

Ho, ho. I suppose I can do without the sports page.

Please can I have one.

And me.

And me.

Of course.

Daddy Pig is making paper boats for everyone.

Let's have a race.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Traffic Jam



Good idea, Mummy Pig. We can huff and puff and blow the paper boats across. Everyone take a deep breath.

Ready, steady, blow!

We have a winner! Uh, who had the sports page?

That's George's boat.

George is the winner.

Hurray!

I like boats. And I like paper boats the best.

Me too!

It's time to go home. Everybody has had a great time.

Peppa's Friends: Bye bye.

Bye bye, ducks. See you soon.

The duck enjoyed the toy boats, but they quite like having the pond back to themselves again.



Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig are making lunch for Peppa and her family.

I've dug up some more potatoes.

Oh, Grandpa. We're already got plenty of potatoes.

You can never have too many potatoes.

OK, but get the potatoes in the oven. The others will be here soon.

Hoho, we've plenty of time. It's only eleven o'clock.

Peppa and her family are on their way.

I wish we'd set off sooner. We're going to be late again.

Don't worry. Mummy Pig. We've still got loads of time.


We're always late when we go to Granny and Grandpa's.

Not this time. I've found a new way. That avoids all the traffic.

Oh, I wasn't expecting that.

Peppa and her family are stuck in a traffic Jam.

Look, there's Danny Dog and Granddad Dog.

Danny Dog and Granddad Dog are in the traffic jam, too.

Hello, Peppa.

Hello, Peppa.

We're going to my Granny and Grandpa's for lunch.

We're going to be late.

It's one o'clock. They're late as usual.

How are your potatoes doing?

Um, they still need a bit more cooking.

Granny Pig speaking.

Hello, Granny Pig. We're stuck in a traffic jam.

Don't worry, we're running late, too. Grandpa's gone over the top with potatoes. See you in a bit.

The poor dears are stuck in a traffic jam.

Sounds like I've got time to get a few more potatoes.

Grandpa Pig!

We're moving so slowly. We'll never get to Granny and Grandpa's.

Peppa's right. We have to try a different way.

But there aren't any other main roads.

I know a shortcut.

Bye bye, everyone! We're taking a shortcut.

Bye bye, Peppa.

Good luck!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Bedtime



Mummy Pig is taking a shortcut to get ahead of the traffic. The shortcut is very bumpy.

This is fun.

Are you sure about this?

Trust me.

Hello, ducks. We're taking a shortcut.

Look! There's the main road again.

Well done! Mummy Pig.

But we're still behind Danny's lorry.

Hello.

Welcome back!

Oh, dear! Mummy Pig's shortcut has not worked very well.

Good! Lunch is ready.

And most important of all: the potatoes are done!

Lunch is ready. But Peppa and her family are still not here.

Grandpa Pig speaking.

We're almost at your house. But the traffic is still moving at the speed of a snail.

A very, very slow snail.

They're almost here. But they're still in the traffic jam.

Poor dears. The food is going to get cold.

I've got an idea. I'll get my wheelbarrow.

What is Grandpa Pig doing?

Granny Pig! Load the lunch into the wheel barrow.

Aye, aye, Grandpa Pig.

If they can't come to the lunch. We have to take the lunch to them.

Look! There's Granny and Grandpa with our lunch in a wheel barrow.


Ahoy, there! Lunch is served.

Is there enough for Danny and Granddad Dog to have some, too?

We've got enough for everyone.

Hooray! Potatoes.

Good job! You did lots and lots of potatoes, Grandpa.

Ho ho. You can never have too many potatoes.



It is almost bedtime. Peppa and George are just finishing their supper.

Daddy Pig!

Oh, sorry. I'm a bit tired. It's been a long day.

George and I aren't sleepy at all. Can we play in the garden?

But it's almost your bedtime!

Can we play outside for just a tiny bit? Please, Mummy! Please, Daddy!

All right. But you must come in when we call you for your bath.

I don't know where they get their energy from.

Peppa and George are playing one last game outside before bedtime.

Look, George! Lots of muddy puddles!

Peppa and George are wearing their boots. They are going to jump up and down in muddy puddles. Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles. George loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Look! The biggest puddle in the world!

What a huge, big puddle!

Peppa! George! Bathtime.

Daddy! Mummy! We found the biggest muddy puddle in the world.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Sports Day



I can see that. Quick, into the bath.

Oh, Can't we just play outside a bit longer?

No, it's bathtime. Are you and George feeling sleepy?

No, Daddy. We are not even a tiny bit sleepy.

Peppa and George might not be sleepy, but I am.

Me, too!

Before bedtime, Peppa and George have their bath. Peppa likes splashing. George likes splashing. Peppa and George both like splashing.

That's enough splashing.

Let's get you dry and into your pajamas.

Oh, can't we just stay in the bath a little bit longer.

Bathtime is over! Now, it's time to clean your teeth.

Before going to bed, Peppa and George brush their teeth.

OK, that's enough brushing. Into your beds!

Oh, I think our teeth need a bit more cleaning.

When you're in bed, Daddy Pig will read you a story.

Hooray.

Peppa and George like stories. When Peppa goes to bed, she always has her Teddy tucked up with her. When George goes to bed, he always has Mr Dinosaur tucked up whth him.

Are you feeling sleepy now?

No, Daddy. We need lots and lots of stories.

Daddy Pig will read you one story. Now, which book do you want?

Um, the Red Monkey book.

OK, I'll read you The Red Monkey book.

Peppa and George like the Red Monkey book.


Once upon a time...

Oh, sorry, Daddy Pig.

Once upon a time, there was a Red Monkey, and this Red Monkey had a bath. And cleaned his teeth. He got into his bed. And soon he fell fast asleep. Good night, Red Monkey.

Peppa and George are asleep.

Goodnight, Peppa and George! Sleep well!

Now, Peppa and George are asleep. Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are going to watch some television.

And now it's time for The Amazing Mr Potato.

I've been looking forward to watching this program.

The Amazing Mr Potato is always ready for action. He runs fast. He jumps high. He never sleeps.

It is bedtime for Peppa and George. And it looks as if it is bedtime for Mummy and Daddy too.



Today is the school sports day. Peppa and her friends are all here.

The first event is running.

The children have to run as fast as they can.

I think I will win. I can run very fast.

I'm faster than you.

Ready... Steady... Go.

I can run at a hundred miles an hour.

I can run at a million miles an hour.

Peppa, Suzy. Stop talking and run.

Oh.

Rebecca Rabbit is in the lead.

Oh, dear! Peppa and Suzy are right at the back.

Come on, Peppa Suzy Danny Rebecca!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Sports Day



Rebecca Rabbit wins. And Peppa and Suzy are last.

The winner of the race is Rebecca Rabbit.

Hooray.

Thank you.

I would have won if you hadn't been talking to me, Suzy.

Now, now, Pepaa. Remember, it's not winning that matters, but taking part.

Yes, Daddy.

The next event is the long jump.

George and Richard have to see who can jump the furthest.

George, run as fast as you can, then jump as far as you can.

George, ready... steady... go!

George has jumped as far as he can.

Now, it's Richard Rabbit's turn.

If Richard doesn't run, he won't jump very far.

Richard Rabbit, ready... steady... go.

Richard Rabbit has jumped further than George.

And the winner is Richard Rabbit.

Hooray!

Waaaaaaa!

George, remember, it's not the winning that matters, but taking part.

The next race is the relay. Each child needs to pick a parent to race.

Peppa, pick me, pick me.

But Daddy, You're not very good at running.

I was very good when I was a little piggy.

But now you have a big tummy.


But I can still touch my toes, nearly.

All right, Daddy. But you must run very fast.

The mummies and daddies will run the first part of the race. And then hand the batons to the children.

Mummies and daddies! Ready, steady, go!

Run, Daddy Mummy.

Daddy Pig is in the lead.

Come on, Daddy Mummy.

Come on Daddy. Thank you, Daddy. You did very well. Now, it's my turn to take the baton.

Peppa, stop talking and run.

Oh.

Keep running! Go on!

And the winner is Emily Elephant.

Hooray.

Oh, Daddy, I haven't won a prize yet.

Don't worry, Peppa. There's still one more event.

And now for the last event of the day. The tug of war. Boys are against girls. When I say go, you must pull the rope with all your strength.

The girls will win.

No, they won't. The boys will win.

Ready! Steady! Go!

Come on, boys!

Come on, pull!

Come on, the girls!

Pull!

I am pulling.

Everyone is pulling so hard. The rope is breaking.

And the result is a draw. So both teams win.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Eye Test



Hooray.

I love the school sports day. Especially when I win a prize.



Peppa and George are playing with Pedro Pony. They are going to jump in muddy puddles. Pedro has slipped and lost his glasses.

Where are my glasses?

Without glasses Pedro can not see very well.

Whoa.

George has found Pedro's glasses.

Ooooh!

Silly George. Here they are.

Thank you.

Pedro, why do you wear glasses?

I need to. The optician says so.

What's an optician?

My daddy is an optician. He checks that you can see clearly.

How? Does he look inside your head?

He does an eye test. Shall I give you an eye test?

Yes, give me an eye test.

OK. Mmm, interesting! Close one eye and say what you see.

I can see George.

Now close both eyes.

Now, I can't see anything.

Mmm, can't see anything. Very, very interesting. I think you need glasses.

Oh, do I?

Yes.

Pedro, home time.


Bye bye, Pedro!

Bye bye!

Mummy, I need glasses.

What?

Pedro gave me an eye test and I need glasses.

I'm sure your eyes are fine.

No, mummy, when I closed my eyes, I couldn't see anything.

But no one can see anything with their eyes closed.

Oh.

What's this about needing glasses?

Pedro knows all about glasses. His daddy is an optician.

All right, Peppa, let's take you to the optician for a proper eye test.

Let's go now.

George, would you like an eye test, too?

No.

Peppa is at the optician's. Mr Pony is the optician.

Hello, Peppa, please sit down. Now, what can I do for you?

I need an eye test, please.

Of course, put these special glasses on and then look at the chart.

Mr Pony is going to test Peppa's eyes.

Can you read these letters for me, please?

OK, Mmm, A... B... C... D... E... F...

Good! Now these numbers, please.

Mmm. ... ... ... ... ... 

Very good! And now these colors, please.

Red... green... orange... blue... yellow... purple.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Granddad Dog's Garage



Excellent! While I check your results, would you like to choose some glasses?

Yes, please.

How about these glasses, Peppa?

They're funny.

I know, what about these ones?

They're too big.

How about these?

Wow, I like these ones, Mummy.

Yes, Peppa. You look fantastic.

I look fantastic.

Good news! Peppa has perfect eyesight.

Oh, so I don't need glasses?

No!

But I really want glasses.

Mmm, I suppose you could have some sunglasses.

Yes, sunglasses.

Here you are.

Fantastic! I hope it's sunny every day. So I can always wear my sunglasses.



This is Granddad Dog's Garage. Here are Peppa and her family in their car.

Hello, Danny!

Hello, Peppa!

What can we do for you today? We've got petrol, air for tyres, and a new automatic car wash.

Uh, two ice lollies, please.

Oh, certainly.

Granddad Dog's Garage sells lots of things, even ice lollies!


Thank you. Goodbye.

Goodbye.

I love our car.

And our car loves us, too. Don't you?

Oh, dear! The car has stopped.

It's no good. It won't start.

I know. I'll ring Granddad Dog.

Granddad Dog speaking.

Help! Our car has broken down.

Danny, we've got some rescuing to do!

Yippee.

To the rescue!

To the rescue!

Look! There's Danny and Granddad Dog.

Hooray!

Granddad Dog knows everything about cars.

Mmm, is it serious?

No, you're just run out of petrol.

What can we do?

There's plenty of Petrol at my garage. I'II tow you there.

Granddad Dog is towing Peppa's car back to his garage.

Granddad Dog is filling Peppa's car with petrol.

Thank you. Granddad Dad.

Here are Suzy Sheep and her mummy in their car.

Hello, Peppa.

Hello Suzy. We ran out of petrol. Granddad Dog rescued us.

Wow, that's exciting! See you later.

See you later.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Foggy Day



Oh, no! All the air has gone out of the tyre.

Will Granddad Dog have to rescue us?

I think so.

Granddad Dog speaking. I see. Don't panic, Mummy Sheep. I'm on my way.

To the rescue!

Can I go, too?

Hop aboard. Peppa.

To the rescue!

To the rescue!

Hello, Suzy, we've come to rescue you.

Hooray!

Granddad Dog is filling the tyre with air.

Thank you! Granddad Dad.

Here are Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig in their car.

Hello Everyone!

Hello Grandpa Pig! Would you like some petrol or air?

No, thanks. I want to try out your new carwash.

Certainly. It's run by a computer.

Hello, I am the carwash of the future. First, soapy water. Then a rinse. And finally, a polish.

Wow.

Sorry, I have malfunctioned.

Oh, dear! The computer has broken. And Grandpa Pig's car is stuck.

Ahh! Do something, Granddad Dog!

Oh, I don't know how to mend computers.

My daddy mended our computer at home.

Uh, well, I didn't really mend the computer. I just...

Good, Then this is job for Daddy Pig.


Um, maybe if I just switch it off. And then switch it on again.

Daddy Pig has mended the carwash.

Hooray!

Granddad Dog is the best at mending cars. But my daddy mended the carwash.



Peppa and George are going to the playground today.

Should we drive to the playground?

No, let's walk.

Look. It's just over there.

The playground is quite close.

OK, let's walk.

This way, everyone.

We're going to the playground. We're going to the playground.

Oh. Where has the sky gone?

Don't worry, Peppa. It's just fog.

What's fog?

Fog is a cloud that is on the ground instead of in the sky.

It's very thick fog.

I can't see a thing.

Mmm, maybe we should go back home.

Yes, we'll go to the playground another day.

Oh.

It is too foggy to find the playground, so Peppa and George have to go back home.

Now, which way is home?

Are we lost, Daddy Pig?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Foggy Day



Don't worry. I know exactly where we are. This way. Oof! Who put that tree there?

Daddy Pig has walked into a tree.

Are you OK, Daddy Pig?

Yes, I'm fine. This way.

Daddy Pig, do you know where you're going?

Yes, of course I do.

I don't think we'll ever find our house again.

I'm sure we will, Peppa. We're only in our garden.

Quack, quack, quack.

Oh, it's the ducks.

Quack, quack.

Hello, Mrs Duck. Have you lost your pond?

Quack.

We're lost too.

We are not lost. I know exactly where we are.

See you later, ducks. Good luck finding your pond.

Oh!

Daddy Pig has found the duck pond.

That's lucky.

Yes, what a stroke of luck.

Quack, quack.

Daddy, Mrs Duck says, Thank you.

You're most welcome, Mrs Duck. Now, let's find our house. I'm sure it's this way.

Hello.

Did you hear something?

Yes. I thought I hear someone say...

Hello.

It's Mummy Rabbit with Rebecca and Richard.

Hello, Peppa. We're lost.


Hello, Rebecca. We're lost too.

We wanted to go to the playground.

So did we, but it's too foggy to get there.

Come on, everyone. Back to our house until the fog clears.

Daddy Pig, do you know where you're going?

Yes, of course I do. This way.

Yes, Daddy Pig.

Aha! I've found our little hill. We'll soon be home.

Hurray!

Our house should be just about... here. Oh?

Daddy Pig has found a ladder.

That's strange. We don't have a ladder in our garden. Goodness me!

Can you see where we are, Daddy Pig?

Yes, I can.

Daddy, where are we?

Why don't you have a look?

OK. Wow!

Wow! I can see everything again.

The fog is going away.

We're at the playground.

Hooray!

Whee! We're at the playground. We're at the playground.

Whee!

Seesaw

Seesaw.

Daddy! Mummy! We're at the playground.

Well, that's lucky. But I thought we were trying to get home.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Jumble Sale



So did I.

Maybe we did get a bit lost after all.



It is a rainy day and the school roof has a hole in it.

Children! We are going to have a jumble sale. The money we raise will pay for a new school roof.

Horray!

Everyone has to bring something for the jumble sale.

What should we bring?

You can bring an old toy or something you don't use anymore.

The parents have arrived to pick up the children.

Home time! Don't forget your old toys for the jumble sale tomorrow.

Peppa is choosing a toy for the jumble sale.

Peppa, have you decided?

Um...

You only have to choose one toy.

Yes, and it will help pay for a new school roof.

OK. I'm going to give... Mr Dinosaur!

Waaaaaaaaa!

Mr Dinosaur is George's favourite toy.

Peppa, you can't give away Mr Dinosaur.

Can't I?

No.

Oh bother! Sorry, George.

Dinosaur.

Why don't you give your old jack-in-a-box?

OK. Now, it's your turn, Daddy!


What?

We must all give something to the jumble sale.

I'm giving this hat and George is giving this ball.

So what shall Daddy give? I know, the television?

Not the telly!

No! It's too useful. Um, I know. Daddy's smelly slippers? No! Too smelly.

I know! Daddy's old chair.

But that's an antique.

What does an-tique mean?

Antique means it's very old and valuable.

But you found it on a rubbish tip, Daddy Pig.

It's worthless.

It'll be worth a lot of money when I mend it.

You've been saying that for ages, Daddy Pig.

I know, I'll give these lovely socks that Granny Pig made me.

Good!

I've come to collect your things for the jumble sale.

Here they are.

Thank you!

And would you like this old chair?

Oh, most generous! Goodbye.

Bye bye. Mummy, you gave away Daddy's chair.

Shhh! Don't tell him. He'll never notice.

It is the day of the jumble sale.

Hello.

Hello, Miss Rabbit.

Peppa! How about this chair? It's a bit rubbish but you can chop it up and use it for firewood.

But it' an antique.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Swimming



Is it?

Daddy says it's worth lots of money.

Well, I never. I'd better put the price up.

Bye.

Hello, everyone.

Peppa's Friends: Hello, Peppa.

What did you give, Suzy?

I gave my nurse's outfit.

I gave my parrot balloon.

I gave my toy monkey.

I will miss my jack-in-a-box. Can I buy this jack-in-abox, please?

And I'd like this nurse's outfit.

The parrot balloon, please.

Mummy, mummy, look what we've bought.

All your old toys!

We missed them.

Look what I've bought! It's an antique chair!

Oh, Daddy Pig! That's not an antique chair.

It is! Miss Rabbit just said so. And it matches my old one.

Yes, Daddy, that's because...

Shhh! Peppa.

...it is your old chair.

What? But Miss Rabbit has just charged me lots of money for it!

Fantasic news, everybody. We have just raised all the money we need for a new school roof.

Hooray!

Thank you, Daddy Pig.

Ho ho. You're most welcome.



Peppa and her family are at the swimming pool. Daddy Pig is wearing his swimming costume. Mummy Pig is wearing her swimming costume. Peppa is wearing her swimming costume.

Hurry up, George! Everyone is waiting.

George is wearing his swimming costume.

Peppa, George, let Daddy put on your armbands.

There, George. Your armbands make you look very grown-up.

Now, me!

Good! Now we can go in the water.

Hooray!

It is George's first time at a swimming pool.

Why don't you put just one foot into the water?

Maybe you should try the other foot.

Maybe George should try both feet at the same time.

Good idea. Well done, George! But you don't need to splash quite so much.

Here is Rebecca Rabbit with her little brother, Richard Rabbit.

Hello, Rebecca!

Hello, everyone!

Richard, hold onto this float and you can practice kicking your legs.

George, would you like to try kicking your legs?

Very good, but try not to splash.

Big children don't splash.

We are very good at swimming.

When George and Richard are older, they'll be able



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Tiny Creatures



to swim like us, won't they, Rebecca?

Yes

Oh!

Richard has a toy watering can.

Stop it, Richard!

Oh, dear, Richard has dropped his watering can into the pool.

Mummy!

Sorry, Richard, I can't reach. It's too far down.

Mummy!

I can't swim underwater.

Even I can't swim underwater.

Mmm, please hold my glasses, Mummy Pig.

Uh...

Hooray!

There you go!

Well done, Daddy Pig!

I am rather good at swimming under water.

The watering can is for babies. Can we jump off the diving boards above now?

Sorry, Peppa, diving boards are only for the grown-ups.

Oh.

Cheer up, you two. You can watch me dive.

Silly daddy, your tummy is too big.

Nonsense! I won trophies for my diving when I was younger.

That's quite a long time ago, Daddy Pig.

It's lucky I've kept myself so fit and strong. Please hold my glasses, Mummy Pig. You'll get a better view if you watch me from the side.

Please don't splash us with water, Daddy.

Of course I won't splash you, Peppa. I think I


need a higher board.

Please be careful, Daddy Pig.

Yes, don't splash us, Daddy.

Don't worry, Peppa.

Don't splash us with water, Daddy.

I told you I wouldn't splash.

Clever Daddy.

Well done, Daddy Pig.

No need for my towel. I've got a special way of drying myself.

Daddy Pig has splashed everyone with water.

Daddy Pig.

Sorry, everyone.



Peppa and George are helping Grandpa Pig pick vegetables.

Peppa, here is a lettuce.

Thank you, Grandpa. Oh, what's that? Urgh!

There's a horrible monster on it!

Mon-sta!

Ho ho. That's not a monster. It's just a little snail.

Oh! Where has he gone?

He's hiding in his shell.

Is that where he lives?

Yes, it's his house. Look, he's coming out again.

Hello, Mr Snail. Grandpa, does Mr Snail have a bed in his house?

Ho ho. No, Peppa.

If I were a snail, I'd have a bed and a table and a chair and a fridge and a television...




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Daddy Pig's Office



Ha ha ha ha ha...

Grandpa, what do snails eat?

Well! Mostly they eat my vegetables! Oy, stop that, you cheeky rascal!

Grandpa! George and I want to play cheeky snails.

These baskets can be your shells. There, now you look like two cheeky snails.

And I am going to eat up all Grandpa Pig's lettuce.

Oy! Keep off my lovely lettuce, you cheeky snails.

And when Grandpa Pig shouts at me I'll hide in my little house.

All of Peppa's friends are here.

Hello, Grandpa Pig.

Hello, Suzy, have you come to play with Peppa and George?

Yes.

I don't know where they are. It's just me and these two snails here.

We are cheeky snails. We are cheeky snails.

Surprise! We were pretending to be snails!

Can we be snails, too?

I don't think I have enough baskets for you all.

Ooh.

You could be something else though.

Something exciting from the garden.

A Carrot?

Rebecca Rabbit likes carrots.

No, Rebecca, not carrots. Come over here.

What's that buzzing sound?

It's coming from that little house.

Grandpa, why is that doll's house making a funny buzzing noise?


That's not a doll's house, Peppa. It's a bee's house. It's called a hive.

Ooh.

Look, here's one now.

What's she doing?

She's collecting nectar from the flower and then she flies back to the hive to make it into honey.

Mmm, I like honey.

Let's pretend to be bees. Buzz, buzz, buzz...

Yes, let's be bees. Buzz, buzz, buzz...

My! What busy bees!

Yes, we're busy bees. Buzz! Now, we must fly back to our hive to make honey.

Buzz, buzz...

Goodness me! What do we have here?

Granny! We're busy bees. Buzz.

Ah! Would you busy bees like some toast?

Yes, please!

And what would you like on your toast?

Honey!

That's lucky, because that's what I've made:

toast and honey!

Hooray!

I like being a bee because they eat lots of lovely honey.

I like being a snail because they eat all Grandpa's lettuce.

Oy!

Oh!

You cheeky rascal!



Today, as a special treat, Peppa and George are




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Daddy Pig's Office



visiting Daddy Pig's office.

Daddy, what do you do at your office all day?

Lots of fun things. You'll see.

This is the building where Daddy Pig works.

We are here.

Hooray!

Yes?

Hello. It's Daddy Pig.

Hello, Daddy Pig.

Can I press the button too?

Of course, Peppa.

Yes?

It's me.

Hello me. Come in.

My office is on the top floor. We have to go up in the lift.

Can I press the button?

I think it's George's turn. Press the top button, George.

Ooh!

The lift is taking Peppa, George and Daddy Pig up to the very top floor.

Wow!

Top floor, door is opening.

This is Daddy Pig's office.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Daddy Pig.

Hello, Daddy Pig.

Mr Rabbit and Mrs Cat work with Daddy Pig.

I brought two very special visitors with me today. Peppa and George.

What an honor.


Let's begin the tour. Mr Rabbit, can we start at your desk?

We certainly can. My job is all about numbers. I take a very important piece of paper. I take a rubber stamp, and I stamp the paper.

Wow!

What a great job Mr Rabbit has.

Can I do some stamping?

Of course. I just find you some paper.

Here are some paper.

Maybe we should use some blank paper. Here you are.

Peppa likes stamping with rubber stamps.

I like doing Mr Rabbit's job.

On with the tour. Next up is Mrs Cat's desk.

Hello, Peppa and George.

Hello.

My job is all about drawing shapes on the computer.

Ooh!

Then I print the shapes out.

Wow!

And here's another copy.

Thank you.

What a nice job Mrs Cat has!

Can I have a go?

Maybe it's George's turn now.

That's right, George. It's your turn to do some work.

George is making blue triangles.

Now you print them out.

I like doing Mrs Cat's job.

Do you want to see my desk now?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pirate Island



Yes, please.

This is Daddy Pig's desk.

My job is quite complicated. I take big numbers, transmit them and calculate their load-bearing tangents.

Daddy Pig's job sounds very important.

Do you use rubber stamps?

No.

Do you use a computer?

No. But I do use coloring pen.

Daddy, can we draw with your coloring pens?

Good idea.

Peppa and George love drawing with coloring pens.

I am drawing a house. George is drawing a dinosaur.

George always draws dinosaurs.

Dinosaur!

My goodness, five o'clock already.

It is home time.

I say! What a splendid picture of a house.

And what a fierce dinosaur.

George and I have been doing Daddy's job.

And they've been doing it very well.

I like doing Mr Rabbit's job and I like doing Mrs Cat's job. But I like doing Daddy's job the best.



Grandpa Pig is taking Peppa and his friends for a day out on his boat.

Everyone on board.

Aye aye, Captain Grandpa.

Full sail.

See you later.



See you later.

Peppa and her friends are all wearing life jackets.

George, you could wear my pirate hat. Today, we are sailing to Pirate Island.

Ooh!

If we are lucky, we might find buried treasure.

Wow!

Pirate Island sounds like a great place.

Land, ahoy. Here we are, Pirate Island.

Hooray!

What's that?

It's a metal detector. It finds buried treasure.

Grandpa Pig is using the metal detector to find buried treasure.

Aha!

The metal detector has found something.

Let's dig it up.

It's a metal coin.

Treasure!

Hooray!

Let's find some more. Aha, we found something else. It sounds big! My goodness! This piece of treasure is quite heavy.

Oh, dear. That's not buried treasure. That's a rusty, old shopping trolley.

Oh.

Maybe that's enough treasure hunting. Who wants to help build a big sand castle?

Me! Me!

What a good idea, Granny Pig. Now I just check on the boat.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. George Catches a Cold



Granny Pig is going to help children build a big sand castle. And Grandpa Pig is doing important boat things.

Ha, this is nice. Maybe I'll just close my eyes for a little bit.

Granny and children are making a big sand castle. They need lots and lots of sand. They use buckets to make the castle's turrets. What a splendid castle.

Hooray!

Time to go home. Oh, where's the boat gone?

Look, Granny.

Oh, no, Grandpa Pig is fast asleep and the boat is drifting away.

We have to wake Grandpa up. Shout as loudly as you can.

Grandpa Pig! Wake up! Wake up!

Oh, no, Grandpa Pig is still asleep.

Grandpa's too far away to hear us.

We're stuck on Pirate Island.

We're castaways.

We'll be here for a hundreds years.

We'll have to eat wild fruit and berries.

And we'll have to eat insects and slugs.

Urgh!

The parents are here to collect the children.

Where am I?

Hello.

Hello, everyone.

Have you had a nice time?

Yes, actually, I've just left something behind.

Back in a tick.

Look, that's Grandpa. We're safe.

Hooray!


Welcome aboard, me hearties.

Naughty Grandpa Pig, we thought you'd left us behind.

Sorry about it, Granny Pig. Next time I promise not to fall asleep.

Good bye, Pirate Island. See you again soon.

I love Pirate Island. Can we visit it again?

Of course we can, Peppa.

Hooray!



Today, it is raining a little bit.

Peppa, George, put your rain clothes on.

With rains, Peppa and George must wear their rain clothes.

Yuck!

George does not like wearing his rain hat.

George, you must keep your hat on.

Why?

Because you must keep dry.

Why?

Because you might catch a cold.

Why?

George, do you want to play in the garden?

Then keep your hat on.

Come on, George.

Peppa and George are going to jump in muddy puddles.

Yuck!

George does not want to wear his rain hat.

Peppa, George.

Come inside. The rain is too heavy to play out.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. George Catches a Cold



Oh, George, where is your hat?

Achoo!

George has caught a cold.

Achoo!

Oh, poor little George! You don't sound well.

Don't worry. I'll ring Doctor Brown Bear.

Doctor Brown Bear speaking. I see. Put George to bed and I'll be straight round.

Thank you, Doctor Brown Bear. Good bye.

Would George be taken to hospital and given medicine?

No, George just has to go to bed.

Oh, so George is not really properly ill.

Achoo!

Urgh! That's disgusting!

Poor George. Let's give you straight to bed.

George, you have to stay in bed for a bit.

No.

George does not want to stay in bed.

Achoo!

George, you have to stay in bed until you are better.

Why?

Because you have to keep warm.

Why?

Uhh... because Doctor Brown bearsaid so.

Hello! Where is my patient? Open wide and say ah...

George is a little bit worried.

Um, Peppa, you are big and brave. Can you show George how to say ah?

Of course. Ah...


Ah...

Mmm, George has caught a cold.

Does George need medicine?

No, but he can have some nice warm milk bedtime to help him to sleep.

Thank you, Doctor Brown Bear.

You are welcome. Good bye!

George has been in bed all day. Now it is Peppa's bedtime.

George, are you better?

Achoo!

George is not better.

Achoo!

George, please don't sneeze so loudly. Ugh! This is impossible.

George. It's a nice warm milk to help you sleep.

The warm milk makes George feel very very sleepy.

Good night, my little piggies.

Ahh, it's so nice in quiet.

It's morning. George has slept very well.

Grrr!

George is better.

Come on everyone! It's a lovely sunny day!

George is wearing his rain hat. He doesn't want to catch another cold.

Oh, George, you don't need to wear your hat.

Why?

Because it's hot and sunny!

Why?

George, can you stop saying why all the time?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Balloon Ride



Why?

George certainly is better.



It is the day of the school fete. Miss Rabbit is running the raffle.

Roll up, roll up! The top prize is a ride in my hot-air balloon.

Wow, that sounds fun!

Can I have a ticket, please?

The blue ticket wins... a toy car! Well done, Danny!

Can I have a ticket, please?

Thank you, Peppa. What are you hoping to win?

The balloon ride!

Wouldn't it be nicer to win the homemade chocolate cake?

Daddy Pig loves homemade chocolate cake.

The red ticket wins... the balloon ride!

Horray!

All aboard for the balloon ride! How many passengers, please?

Four please.

And Teddy!

Dinosaur!

Oh, and a teddy and a dinosaur. That makes six. All aboard! Hurry up, Daddy Pig! Hop aboard!

Quick, Daddy!

Splice the mainbrace! Chocks away! Full steam ahead!

Very impressive, Miss Rabbit. You must be an expert pilot.

Not really, this the first time I've ever flown a


balloon.

Oh...

Hold Tight!

Miss Rabbit heats up the air in the balloon to make it rise into the sky.

Bye bye.

Bye bye.

Would anyone like to do the map reading?

I will.

Are you sure, Daddy Pig?

I'm very good at map reading. Oh... this map is a bit difficult.

Shall we go higher?

Yes, please! Higher! Higher!

The balloon is rising high into the sky.

Oh! Where did the sky go!

Don't worry, Peppa, we're just flying through a cloud.

Ooh.

Wow, the sky is back again!

Horray.

Big balloon, big balloon, bigger than the sun and

moon. Flying high, in the sky, fly and fly and fly and fly...

Look, Teddy, we're flying really high.

Peppa, be careful you don't drop...

Teddy! I've dropped Teddy!

Don't worry, Peppa. We'll rescue Teddy. Hold tight, everybody! We're going down!

Miss Rabbit is making the balloon go down so that Teddy can be rescued.

I can't see Teddy anywhere.

There he is! Teddy's caught in a tree.

I can use this anchor to rescue Teddy. Slowly,



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. George's Birthday



slowly. There!

Daddy Pig has rescued Teddy.

Teddy!

Horray!

Oh dear! No one is looking where they are going.

Look out! Tree straight ahead! Hold tight!

Oh!

First Teddy was stuck in a tree and now we are stuck in a tree.

Daddy Pig, do you know where we are?

Mmm.

We're lost, aren't we?

Yes.

Ooh.

Look, everyone! That's Granny and Grandpa's house?

Yes! We must be in Grandpa Pig's garden!

As I thought.

Ahoy there, Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig!

Goodness me! Ahoy there, Miss Rabbit!

Uh... Help! Please.

Grandpa, we can't get down!

Don't worry. I've got a ladder.

Horray!

Everyone climbs down from the big balloon.

Granny! Grandpa! Miss Rabbit took us for a ride in her big balloon.

How very exciting.

I'm afraid the most exciting thing we can offer is a piece of my homemade chocolate cake.

Homemade chocolate cake! That is exciting!


That was the best balloon ride ever!

Mmm. And that was the best chocolate cake ever!

Big balloon, big balloon, bigger than the sun and

moon. Flying high, in the sky, fly and fly and fly and fly...



Today is George's birthday. It is very early in the morning.

George! It's too early!

Dinosaur! Grrr!

Go back to bed!

It sounds like someone's up bright and early!

Happy birthday, George!

George woke me up.

You woke everyone up on your birthday, Peppa.

That was different. That was my birthday.

And today is George's birthday.

Happy birthday, George.

Here's your present, George.

Ooh? Dinosaur!

I knew it would be some sort of dinosaur thingy.

Grrr!

Squeeze its tummy!

Too scary!

George. I've made you a birthday card. Can you guess what the picture is?

George can not guess.

I was going to paint you a flower.

Oh!

George does not like flowers.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Long Grass



But in the end, I painted you a...

Dinosaur!

That's a lovely picture, Peppa.

Yes. I am very good at painting.

Now, we're going somewhere very special for George's birthday treat!

Yippee! Let's go! Where are we going?

You'll see.

The family are setting off for George's birthday treat.

Are we going to the circus?

No. But it's somewhere just as good.

Um, is it the cinema?

No, much better.

I just can't guess.

Where can they be going?

We're here!

The family have arrived at the museum.

Why are we at the museum?

Come on, you'll see.

What can George's birthday treat be?

George? What do you like best in the whole world?

Dinosaur! Ooh! Dinosaur!

George's birthday treat is a visit to the museum dinosaur room.

Huh, dilly old dinosaurs again!

Dinosaur. Whoa!

Don't be frightened, George. It's not a real dinosaur.

It's just a robot. Look, I stand on this spot and...

Grrr!


And now, there's another surprise!

All of George and Peppa's friends are here!

George's Friends: Surprise!

Mummy Rabbit has made a birthday cake for George.

Can anyone guess what sort cake it is?

A dinosaur cake?

It is! What an amazing guess, Peppa!

Happy birthday, George!

There's one last surprise. Follow me!

What is the last surprise?

What do you think it is, Peppa?

It's probably something to do with dinosaurs. Oh. What's that?

It just needs to be filled with air...

I know! I know! It's a bouncy castle!

Peppa loves bouncy castles!

But if it's for George, why isn't it a something to do with dinosaurs?

Ho ho. It is a dinosaur! A bouncy dinosaur!

Hooray!

George loves bouncy dinosaurs! Everyone loves bouncy dinosaurs.

This is great! Happy birthday, George!



Peppa and George are playing in the garden.

Oh!

The grass has not been cut for a while. It has grown very long.

Come on, George.

George, where are you? I can't see you. George, I am coming to get you.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Long Grass



Peppa and George can not see each other.

Oof! Haha.

Peppa and George love playing in the long grass.

Daddy Pig is going to read his newspaper.

What a nice day for doing nothing.

Daddy Pig loves doing nothing.

Goodness me, Daddy Pig. We've let the garden get a bit out of our control.

What do you mean, Mummy Pig?

The grass  it needs cutting.

Ho, I quite like it, it the wild garden look.

Mummy, Daddy, come and play in the long grass.

It's fun.

Okay, let's all play with this spotty ball.

Oh, where's it gone?

The ball is lost in the long grass.

Now I'll never find it.

Maybe it's time to cut the grass.

Yes, Daddy Pig.

I'II get the lawn mower. I am sure it's here somewhere. Ah! Here it is.

Daddy Pig has found the lawn mower.

It's a bit old and rusty.

Nonsense. It'II have grass cut in no time.

It does a bit rusty.

Maybe I should phone Grandpa Pig and ask if he could borrow us his lawn mower.

This's no need to phone Grandpa. I just need to push it a bit harder.

Daddy Pig's lawn mower is not very good.

Oh, I know, let's phone Grandpa.

Hello, Grandpa Pig speaking.


Hello, Grandpa Pig, could you help us cut some very long grass?

Oh, certainly. I'll be over right away. Bye. I think this is a job for Betsy.

Grandpa Pig is driving his motor mower over to Peppa's house.

Grandpa Pig!

Papa 'ig!

Hello, everyone. I hear there's some grass that needs cutting.

And it's just a bit too long for my lawn mower.

Don't worry. Betsy will have it done in no time.

Is your lawn mower called Betsy?

She certainly is.

Hello, Betsy. Grandpa, can we ride on Betsy?

Of course you can. Hop aboard.

Aye-aye. Captain Grandpa.

We'll have this grass cut in no time. Hold tight, here we go.

Whee...

Betsy is very good at cutting grass.

This is fun.

There, finished.

Grandpa, you've missed a bit.

Oh, yes. What's this?

Oh, the spotty ball. Thank you for finding our ball, grandpa.

And thank you for cutting the grass.

Cutting grass is easy for Betsy.

Now we can play with our spotty ball.

To you, Daddy.

The ball bounce very well on the short grass.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Zoe Zebra the Postman's Daughter



To you, George.

Papa 'ig.

Oh, oh. Catch!



Mr Zebra the postman is delivering a letter to Peppa's house. Zoe Zebra is with her daddy today. She has her own letters to deliver.

Danny Dog, Suzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit, ah, Peppa and George. Just these ones left.

Good, let's get them delivered.

Yes, Dad.

Post.

Peppa and George love it when the post arrives.

We've got two letters.

This one is for Daddy Pig.

How exciting! Dear Mr Pig, please pay your telephone bill. Oh!

What's a bill? It sounds very boring.

Ah, bills are very boring.

Mummy, is the other letter for you?

No, this one's for Peppa and George.

Wow, a letter for George and me.

Please come to my birthday party, love Zoe Zebra.

Zoe Zebra has invited Peppa and George to her birthday party.

Yippee!

You need to write a reply to Zoe to tell her you are coming to her party.

Can you help us write it, Mummy?

Of course.

Peppa and George are writing a reply to Zoe.


What would you like to say?

Dear Zoe.

Dear Zoe.

Um, I don't know what to say next.

How about, we would love to come to your party. Kind regards, Peppa and George.

What color envelope shall we use?

The red one.

Miss Zoe Zebra.

And the last of all, the stamp.

The letter is ready to be posted. This is the post box. Here are Danny, Suzy, Pedro, Rebecca, and Emily Elephant. They are all posting letters. And here is Peppa with her letter.

There! Now what happens?

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Peppa. Did you get my letter about my party?

Yes, and I've written you a reply.

Oh, goody.

My goodness, so many letters today.

And this letter is mine. It is very very important.

Is it for me? Can I open it now?

It is for you, Zoe. But it must be delivered before you can open it. That's how the post works.

Oh!

And with so many letters to deliver today, I'd better make a start.

Can George and I come along too?

Hop aboard! Peppa and George.

See you later.

Peppa and George are helping Mr Zebra to deliver the post. This is Zoe Zebra's house.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Painting



This letter is addressed to Miss Zoe Zebra. Miss Zoe Zebra. Zoe Zebra. Zoe Zebra. Zoe Zebra. Ho ho, all the post is for Zoe.

That's my letter. Can I post it?

Certainly.

Peppa loves posting letters.

Mummy, look, all these letters are for me.

Oh, amazing.

Can you read it, Mummy?

Dear Zoe, I would love to come to your party, from Danny Dog.

Suzy Sheep's coming to your party too.

And Rebecca, Pedro, Emily, Candy. They are all coming to your party.

And this letter is from me. It says we are coming to your party, love and kisses, Peppa and George.

Everyone has arrived for Zoe's party.

Zoe's Friends: Happy birthday, Zoe.

Wow, so many presents.

You'll be writing lots of thank you letters, Zoe.

And who is going to deliver all those "thank you" letters?

You are, Daddy. But I can help.



Peppa and George are painting today.

We need some old newspaper to put on the table.

Yes!

Daddy Pig is reading his newspaper.

You could have my newspaper when I've finished reading it. Ho ho ho, all right!

Hooray! Now we can start painting. Silly George! Big children do not put their hands in the paint.


George loves painting with his hands. Peppa loves painting with her hands.

Very good. Can I have a potato, Mummy Pig?

They aren't cooked yet, Daddy Pig.

Are you hungry, Daddy?

I am not going to eat it. Watch this!

What is Daddy Pig doing?

Ooh!

Now who can tell me what this is.

A flower! Clever daddy!

Ho ho, ho ho! I loved painting when I was a young piggy. Now where are my old painting things?

Daddy, why are you wearing that funny hat?

Ho ho ho! This is my beret. It puts me in the mood for painting pictures.

Now what shall I paint? Well chosen, George.

I'll paint the old cherry tree.

What's that?

It's an easel, Peppa. It hold my canvas.

What's the canvas?

It's big like paper for very special paintings.

Is that toothpaste?

Ho ho. No, Peppa, These are special paints for grown-up artist.

There! What color should we begin with?

Red, please!

Why red, Peppa?

Red is my favorite color.

But first we need to paint the sky. Look! What color is it?

Blue, of course.

Very good. Let's start with blue.

Now for the cherry tree. We need green for the



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Cuckoo Clock



leaves.

But there isn't any green.

Never mind! If we mix blue paint with yellow paint, we can make green.

Mixing blue and yellow makes green.

Ooh!

What lovely green leaves! And here's some grass...

What about the brown branches? We haven't got brown paint.

We can make brown. We'll mix the green and the red.

Mixing green and red makes brown.

Ooh!

Daddy Pig paints the tree trunk and the branches.

Whah!

Daddy, can I paint the cherries?

Yes, Peppa, put your fingers in the paint and dab it onto the tree.

One, two, three.

Well done! Now it's George's turn. What a great painter you are, George! There, the painting is finished.

Hooray!

Oh, it's the ducks. Hello, Mrs Duck. We are painting a picture.

The ducks are running through Daddy's paint.

Shoo! Shoo! Naughty ducks!

Shoo! Ducks! Shoo! Stay away from my painting.

Oh, no! The ducks have made paint footprints all over the painting.

Oh, dear!


What was all that noisy?

Mummy, the ducks have spoiled our painting.

Mmm, let me see.

The ducks are making paint footprints in the garden just like the ones on the painting.

Daddy's painting isn't spoiled, Peppa. It's perfect!

Hooray!

Oh, yes. I am a bit of an expert at painting.

And so are the ducks.



It is early morning. Mummy and Daddy Pig are still asleep.

Wakey, wakey, Mummy and Daddy!

What?

It's time to get up!

It's much too early! Don't you know what time it is, Peppa?

No, Daddy! Our clock doesn't work!

Oh dear. Let's see if we can mend it.

Ah. The old cuckoo clock!

Why is it called a cuckoo clock?

There's a Little wooden bird inside called a cuckoo.

I've never seen the cuckoo.

That's because we stopped winding it a long time ago!

The cuckoo got a bit annoying.

Oh. Can we wind it up again? Please!

Alright.

Daddy Pig is winding up the cuckoo clock.

There.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Cuckoo Clock



Daddy Pig sets the clock to the right time. It is nearly  o'clock.

Daddy, can we see the cuckoo now?

You'll see the cuckoo soon!

What does she look like, Daddy?

Now, let me think. She moves her head like this. And she flaps her wings like this. And she says, cuckoo!

Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

What a noisy little cuckoo you are, George!

Cuckoo!

Look! It's going to do something.

Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

Wow! Silly George! You missed the Cuckoo! The cuckoo was really, really brilliant. She went cuckoo! And you missed it.

Wah!

Never mind, George! You can see Cuckoo next time.

Yes, but you'll have to wait. Cuckoo only comes out once an hour.

Waiting is boring! Come on, George, let's play outside.

George does not want to play outside. He is waiting to see Cuckoo.

It is nearly  o'clock. George has been waiting for Cuckoo for almost an hour.

George, come and play! Mr Dinosaur wants you to play, too! Grrr!

Grrr! Dinosaur!

Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

George has missed Cuckoo again!

Wah!

Never mind, George. Why don't you play in the garden? I'll call you when it's time to see Cuckoo.


To you, George!

It is nearly  o'clock.

Peppa! George! Time to see Cuckoo!

Quick, George! You can't miss Cuckoo again!

George is running faster than he has ever run before.

Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

George, did you see Cuckoo?

Cuckoo. Cuckoo.

Cuckoo.

Peppa and George love playing cuckoos.

Cuckoo.

Cuckoo.

It is night time. Peppa and George are very sleepy.

Cuckoo.

Peppa and George are asleep.

Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

Is it morning already?

Uh, no. Time to sleep.

Cuckoo is not very well!

She just needs to sleep, like you and George.

Good night!

Good night, my little piggies.

George, I know how to make Cuckoo better. We'll wind her up like Daddy did!

Mummy and Daddy are fast asleep.

What?

Mummy! Daddy! We've got something to show you! We've made Cuckoo better!

Cuckoo! Cuckoo!



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Baby Piggy




Peppa and George are visiting their big cousin Chloe.

Today, as well as seeing Chloe, you are going to meet your new cousin.

Ooh!

Peppa and her family have arrived at Chloe's house.

Peppe's Family: Hello!

Hello, everyone!

Hello, Peppa and George!

This is Chloe, Peppa and George's big cousin.

But where's our new cousin?

Here's your new baby cousin!

Peppe's Family: Ooh!

The new cousin is a tiny, baby piggy.

Goo goo goo.

Ooh! How beautiful!

Is it a girl baby?

No, it's a boy.

Oh. I wish it was a girl.

Me, too.

George is pleased the baby is a boy.

Dinosaur!

Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

I think the baby's too little to play with dinosaurs.

George. The baby doesn't want to play with you. It wants to play with me.

Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

Peppa, the baby is much too little to play ball games.


But if it can't play with a dinosaur or a ball, what can it do?

It eats and it sleeps.

Burp!

And it does that.

Aunty Pig, can I hold the baby?

Yes. If you're very careful, you can hold Alexander.

Alexander?

That's his name, Baby Alexander'.

What a big name for such a small piggy.

It's quite nice, even though it's a boy.

Goo goo goo.

Oh. What's that smell?

Maybe Alexander's nappy needs changing.

Urgh! Disgusting!

Peppa, when you were a baby you wore nappies.

I did not.

Mummy, can I play with Peppa and George in the garden?

Yes.

Chloe, is it nice having a little baby brother?

Yes. Alexander is very sweet.

I wish George was a sweet little baby piggy.

I know! George can pretend to be a baby piggy. He can go in my doll's pram.

That's a good idea!

No!

George does not want to be a baby.

George. If you pretend to be a baby, I promise to be nice to you for ever and ever.

George is thinking.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grandpa's Little Train



And you can play with all my toys.

George is thinking more.

And when we get home, you can play with all my toys.

George has decided!

Goo goo goo!

What a sweet baby piggy.

Here are Candy Cat, Suzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit and Zoe Zebra.

Peppa's Friends: Hello!

Why is George in that doll's pram?

It's not George. It's a baby piggy.

Goo goo.

But it is George.

George is a pretend baby piggy.

Peppa's Friends: Ahhhhh!

Is it a girl or a boy?

It's a girl.

No!

George does not want to be a girl baby.

OK. It's a boy.

I've got some cookies. Would the baby piggy like one?

Oh no. It can't eat cookies.

Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

George likes cookies!

Maybe it can have one cookie.

Goo goo.

It's so clever!

And so handsome!

Burp!

It's very funny!


It's the best baby piggy ever!

George likes this game.

Here is Aunty Pig with Baby Alexander.

Wow! A proper, real baby piggy!

It's so gorgeous!

It's much sweeter than George.

Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

Oh dear. George liked being the baby piggy.

Oh, George! You'll always be my baby piggy.

Maybe it's time for a new game. How about some dinosaur chasing!

Grrr!

Eeek! Too scary!

George liked being a baby piggy, but he likes being George more.



Peppa and George have come to play in Granny and Grandpa's garden.

What's that noise?

Grandpa's making something.

Hello, Peppa and George! That's perfect timing. I've just finished making it!

And may we ask what "it" is?

I'll show you!

Wow!

A little toy train!

It's not a toy. This is Gertrude. She's a miniature locomotive.

But doesn't it need railway tracks to run on?

Oh no. I've fitted Gertrude with car wheels, so she can go anywhere she likes.

Grandpa, can we ride in Gertrude?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grandpa's Little Train



Hop aboard! Full steam ahead!

Bye bye, Granny!

See you later!

Peppa and George love Grandpa's little train.

Grandpa's train goes choo choo choo, choo choo choo, choo choo choo! Grandpa's train goes choo choo choo, all day long!

And the piggies on the train go oink oink oink, oink oink oink, oink oink oink! And the piggies on the train go oink oink oink, all day long!

Here is Granddad Dog with Danny Dog.

Hello!

Hello, Danny!

I see you're playing toy trains.

Toy? Gertrude isn't a toy! How's your little lorry?

Little lorry? My breakdown truck is a proper, work vehicle.

Granddad? Can I ride on the train?

Mmm. It's your choice, Danny, if you'd rather play trains than...

Thanks Granddad!

See you later!

Miss Rabbit is driving the school bus.

And to our left, we can see some hills with trees...

Hello, everyone!

Peppa's Friends: Hello, Peppa!

All Peppa's friends are here.

Can we ride on the train?

Um. I'm giving the children an educational bus tour. Are trains educational?

They certainly are!

Mmm. Hands up, all those who want to ride


on the train.

Me! Me! Me!

And hands up, all those who want to stay on the bus.

OK, you can all go on the train. And I'll follow along behind.

Grandpa's train goes choo choo choo, choo choo choo, choo choo choo! Grandpa's train goes choo choo choo, all day long!

What a lot of mud!

We don't want to get stuck. Maybe we should go a different way.

It's only a patch of mud. Come on, Gertrude!

You can make it!

Come on, bus! You can make it!

The bus is stuck in the mud.

Oh bother!

Hello, Miss Rabbit! How are you today?

I'm a bit stuck. Can you rescue me?

Certainly!

Is your truck strong enough?

Trust me.

Did it work?

Er, no. We need a vehicle with more power...

Can I help in any way?

Er, it's nothing that I can't deal with.

Thanks anyway.

I've got an idea! Grandpa Pig's train can tow me out of the mud!

Er. Good thinking, Miss Rabbit.

Grandpa's little train is going to pull the bus out of the mud.

Full steam! Come on, Gertrude!



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Cycle Ride



Come on, Gertrude!

Horray!

Ho ho. Well done!

It's amazing what can be done by a toy train!

Toy? Gertrude isn't a toy!

Gertrude is the very best train in the whole world!



It is a lovely sunny day. Peppa and George are finishing their breakfast.

Today is a good day for a cycle ride.

A cycle ride, yippee!

Peppa and George love cycle ride. Peppa has her bicycle. George has his tricycle. Mummy and daddy have their tandem.

What's that?

It's our bicycle. I sit at the front and Mummy Pig sits at the back.

And we can put these two seats on the back for Peppa and George.

But we want to ride our own bicycles.

George is a bit too little. His legs will get very tired.

But I am a big girl. I won't get tired.

It will be a long cycle ride. Peppa, are you sure?

Yes, Daddy, I am sure.

OK, are we all ready?

Yes, Daddy Pig.

Then let's go.

Wee... I am winning.

It is not a race, Peppa. It's just a gentle bicycle ride.

Yes, Daddy but I'm still winning.


Haha, now we are winning.

I don't like cycling uphill.

Peppa, we won the race.

No, you didn't, Daddy. Because I wasn't racing that time. But now I am. Can't catch me.

Ha ha, you cheeky little piggy.

Hello, ducks, we are having a cycle ride.

Hello, ducks.

I've forgotten how much I love cycling. Oh, I've forgotten how much I hate cycling up hills.

The ground is getting quite steep.

I don't like cycling up hills.

But look at the beautiful view.

My goodness, this is hard work. Mummy Pig, you're not peddling.

Sorry, Daddy Pig, I was just enjoying the view.

Peppa and her family have reached the top of the hill. All Peppa's friends are here.

Peppa's Friends: Hello, Peppa.

Hello.

We are going to have a race on our bikes.

Peppa, do you want to race too?

OK, as long as we race downhill.

OK.

Peppa and her friends are going to race down the hill.

Are you all ready?

Ready.

You can start when I honk the horn. Like this.

Whee!

Pedro has set off too soon.

Stop, Pedro. The race hasn't started yet.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Ice Skating



Sorry, Mr Pig.

I was just letting you know that the horn sounds like this.

Whee!

Pedro's Friends: Stop! Stop!

Sorry, Pedro. That time was my fault. The next time when I honk the horn, you can go.

Did you say go?

I think so.

Peppa's Friends: Go! Go! Go!

Go on, Peppa.

But Daddy, you didn't honk the horn.

Danny Dog is in the lead.

Wait for me. Wee... I win!

Peppa's Friends: Well done, Peppa.

Yes, I'm very good at cycling downhill.

It is home time for Peppa's friends.

Peppa's Friends: Byebye, Peppa.

Bye.

Home time for us too, Peppa.

Mummy, I am tired. All the cycling up and down hills has made my legs tired. Can I ride on your bike?

But where would Daddy Pig sit?

Um, Daddy can ride my bike. It's very nice.

Oh, okay.

I love the tandem. Daddy, do you like my bike?

Yes, Peppa, it's very nice.



Peppa and her family are going ice skating today.

This will be fun.

Peppa and George has never been ice-skating


before.

Now George, you won't be very good at ice-skating, so just do what I do.

I am sure we'll all be very good.

Yes. Especially me.

First, we need some skates.

At the ice rink, everyone wear skates.

Hello, Miss Rabbit.

Hello, Mummy Pig.

We'd like to hire some skates, please.

There you go.

Peppa's Family: Thank you.

Happy skating.

Here are Suzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit, Danny Dog, Zoe Zebra, Candy Cat, Emily Elephant, and Pedro Pony.

Peppa's friends can ice-skate very well. Peppa wants to ice-skate, too.

Hello, everyone.

Peppa's Friends: Hello, Peppa.

Is this your first time skating?

Yes.

Shall I show you how to skate?

No, thank you, Suzy, I am sure I can already do it.

Okay, come on then.

This is impossible. I don't want to do ice-skating anymore.

Don't worry, Peppa. Everyone falls over when they ice-skate. Even I fall over. Watch this, oopsy daisy!

Silly Daddy.

George, would you like to skate?

No.

George has never skated before, and he is a bit



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Dentist



worried.

I'll look after George while you teach Peppa how to skate.

Skating is easy, Peppa. Just push with your feet and glide. Push, push, glide. See?

Push, push, glide. Push, push, glide. This is easy, I can do it on my own now, Mummy. Push, push, glide. Push, push, glide.

Well done, Peppa.

Look at me, I'm skating.

Peppa is doing really well.

Yes, I am a very good teacher. Slow down, Peppa. You'll bump into someone.

Don't worry, Mummy, I am very good at skating. Oh, where are the brakes?

Oh, dear. I forgot to teach Peppa how to stop.

Oh.

Ah, I can not stop. Look out!

Mummy Pig taught you how to skate, but I taught you how to fall over.

Yes, I am very good at falling over.

George, do you want to skate too?

No.

Come on, George. It's fun. I'll teach you. First, you need to...

Whee...

George, come back, I'm teaching you how to ice-skate.

What a surprise! George can skate beautifully.

Wow, look at George.

Very good, George. Now you need to learn how to stop.

Well done, George.



You're fantastic, George!

Yes, you did very well, George, for your first lesson.

Come on, let's skate.

Peppa's Family: Yes.

Peppa and George love ice-skating. Everyone love ice-skating.

Mummy and Daddy taught me how to skate, but I taught George.



Every morning Peppa and George brush their teeth. Today Peppa and George are going to the dentist.

Peppa, George, are you ready to go for your check-up?

I am too busy for a check-up. I am having a tea party with teddy. Yes, we are very busy.

We all need check-ups to make sure our teeth are clean and healthy.

Okay, daddy. George, are your teeth clean like mine?

It is George's first visit to the dentist.

You both have lovely clean teeth. I am sure the dentist will be very happy.

Peppa and George are at the dentist's waiting for their check-up.

Ah, waiting is boring.

This magazine's very interesting. It's all about potatoes.

Peppa, George, the dentist will see you now.

Hooray!

This is Dr Elephant, the dentist.

Hello, Peppa, have you been brushing your teeth?

Yes, Dr Elephant.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Dens



Good. Now, who's first?

I am first, because I am a big girl. Watch me, George.

Sitting in the chair, please. Hold tight.

Whee...

Open wide, please.

Ah...

Wider, please.

Ah...

Now let's take a look

Dr Elephant uses a little mirror to look at Peppa's teeth.

I hope you haven't been eating too many sweeties, Peppa.

It is quite difficult to speak when your mouth is wide open.

There, all done. What lovely clean teeth!

She takes after me.

Can I have this special pink drink now?

Yes, but don't drink, Peppa. Spit it out.

George, now it's your turn.

No.

George does not want it to be his turn.

Maybe you can hold Mr Dinosaur while the dentist looks at your teeth.

Grrr! Dinosaur.

Very please to meet you, Mr Dinosaur.

It is not a real dinosaur. It's made of plastic.

Hold tight. You're doing very well, George. Now can you show me your teeth?

George does not want to show the dentist his teeth.

George, open wide, like this. Ah... ah...


Aaaaah...

Ah, there they are. All done. You have very strong clean teeth, George.

Are they as lovely as mine, Dr Elephant? Ah...

Yes.

George is very proud to have clean teeth.

George, don't forget the pink drink.

Oh, wait, what's this?

What's wrong, Dr Elephant?

George has clean teeth, but this young dinosaur's teeth are very dirty.

Oh, no. Dr Elephant is very cross with Mr Dinosaur.

Not at all, Peppa. It's my job to make teeth clean. The water jet please, Miss Rabbit.

The dentist uses water to clean Mr Dinosaur's teeth.

The polisher, please, Miss Rabbit. This would be a bit noisy.

Dr Elephant polishes Mr Dinosaur's teeth.

Pink, pink...

That's righ, George. Mr Dinosaur needs some special pink drink.

Gosh, what shining teeth you have, Mr Dinosaur.

Grrr! Dinosaur.

Too scary.

George loves Mr Dinosaur, especially now he has nice clean teeth.



Peppa and George are in Granny and Granpa Pig's garden. They are going to play in their tree house. Peppa and George love their tree house.

Here are Peppa and George's friends. Zoe, Suzy,




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Dens



Rebecca and Richard.

I like your tree house, Peppa.

Can we come in?

Yes. Now we can have a tea party.

Here are Pedro and Danny.

Hello, Peppa.

Can we come in?

Sorry, Danny, only girls can come into the tree house.

Boys are a bit noisy.

They always spoiled the tea parties.

But George and Richard are boys.

Oh, yes, sorry, George, this tree house is for girls only.

What's wrong?

The girls won't let us into the tree house.

It isn't fair.

Ho ho. I think I can help. Come over here.

Now we can have a nice quiet tea party. What's that noisy?

There. Now you boys have your very own den with this very own drawbridge.

A castle.

Thank you, Grandpa Pig.

Can we come in?

No, this is the boy's den, for boys only.

But I love castles.

Castles aren't as good as tree houses. Come on, girls.

I'm the king of the castles.

Every castle needs a flag.

Wow.


They've got a flag.

We don't need a silly flag.

Here is Granny Pig.

Hello, girls, can I get you anything?

A flag, please.

And it must be better than the boy's flag.

I'll see what I can do.

I am the king of the castle.

Ho ho. Every castle needs a telephone. Hold this. Keep this string nice and tight and you can talk to the boys.

We don't want to talk to the boys.

We don't want to talk to the girls.

Granny Pig has found a flag for the girl's den.

This dress will make a pretty flag.

Thank you, granny.

It isn't as good as the boy's flag.

I wish I were in the castle.

Fairy Princess is live in the castles.

If I were fairy princess, I would live in the tree house.

Can we come over, please?

Only if you say the castle is the best.

It is the best.

I'm staying in my tree house.

I love the castle.

Oh, dear, it is raining, and the castle has no roof.

Let's go to the tree house.

No, I'll never leave my castle.

The rain has stopped. George has found a muddy puddle.

That looks fun.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pretend Friend



I'm staying in my castle.

I'm staying in my tree house.

I'll look after your castle, Danny.

I'll look after your tree house, Peppa.

Peppa and Danny love jumping up and down in muddy puddles. Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles whether they are boys or girls.


Suzy Sheep has come to play with Peppa.

Hello Peppa!

Hello Suzy!

This is my new friend, Leo Lion.

Where is he? There is no one there.

Suzy has made up a pretend friend.

Can't you see him, Peppa?

Uh...

Let's play catch.

OK! To you, Leo.

Peppa throws the ball to Suzy's pretend friend.

Leo can't catch the ball.

He can, he just doesn't like playing catch.

What does Leo like directly?

He likes to roar.

Is he going to roar now?

Yes, Roar...

Wasn't that you?

No, that was Leo.

Ah... Hello Leo!

Peppa pretend that she can see Leo Lion.

Leo, Will you be my friend too? What did he say?


He is nodding his head.

That means yes!

Peppa, Suzy, would you like to come inside and have some fruit cake?

Mummy Pig has two slices of fruit cake to Suzy and Peppa.

Mummy, Suzy's got a pretend friend. He is called Leo Lion.

I see, and does he like fruit cake too?

Roar... Leo love fruit cake.

Don't be silly, Peppa. That wasn't Leo. That was you! Leo prefers chocolate cake.

I haven't got chocolate cake. Will Leo have some fruit cake?

Roar... He will try a little slice.

Mummy Pig gives some cake to Suzy's pretend friend.

George is playing with Mr Dinosaur.

Dinosaur. Grrr!

George, you are sitting on Leo.

George does not know that Suzy has a pretend friend.

Roar... Leo Lion said he can't finish his cake, so George can have it.

Can we play upstairs now?

Yes. Let's play dressing up.

I was asking Leo.

Oh...

Roar! Leo says he likes playing dressing up.

Good. Come on Leo.

Peppa and Suzy are playing dressing up. Peppa is going to be a fairy.

I grant you one wish.

My wish is to be Queen Suzy.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. School Bus Trip



And Leo Lion will be the jester.

He doesn't want to be the jester. He wants to be the King.

Here is the Daddy Pig.

Mummy Pig tells me you have a very special visitor.

It's only Suzy, Daddy.

Are you sure there isn't someone else, Peppa?

There is someone else. King Leo Lion. Roar...

Ho ho ho. It's an honor to meet you, King Leo.

Daddy Pig pretends he can see King Leo.

May I say what a fine golden mane you have!

Yes, it's very fine, and he is wearing his best red trousers.

Oh, yes!

And his blue jumper.

Silly Peppa, Leo isn't wearing a blue jumper. He is wearing his best green shirt!

Well, if it's sort of a bluey green.

Peppa, Suzy, your friends are here.

Peppa's friends are here. They all wearing their boots.

Let's jumping muddy puddles.

Yes!

Are you sure Leo should jumping puddles without his boots?

Oh! I forgot! Leo is wearing his boots as well. Look at Leo! He's jumping up and down too! Roar...

Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, even pretend friends.

Roar...



Peppa and her friends are going on a school bus trip.

Full steam ahead.

See you later.

Children, attention, please. Today we are going on a trip to the mountains.

Hooray!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Rebecca Rabbit



Have all of you got your lunch boxes?

Yes. Madame Gazelle.

Madame Gazelle, please can we eat our lunch now?

Peppa, we'll eat lunch when we arrive in the mountains.

Peppa, what have you got in your lunch box?

All right. A red apple.

I have got a green apple.

Let's swap.

OK.

Peppa, Suzy? What are you doing?

Suzy told me to open my lunch box.

Peppa told me to swap our apples.

Haha, that's fine. But please save some food for the picnic.

Yes, Madame Gazelle.

The bus has arrived at the foot of the mountains.

The mountain road is very steep.

Come on, bus, you can make it.

Come on, bus. Hooray!

Peppa and her friends are at the top of the mountain.

Look at the view.

Wow!

Peppa's Echo: Wow! Wow! Wow!

Who said that?

It's your echo.

What's my echo?

An echo is the sound you hear when you speak loudly in the mountains.

Like this. Yo da la yeewo.

Madame Gazelle's Echo: Yo da la yeewo. Yo da la yeewo.



Yo da la yeewo.

Peppa's Echo: Yo da la yeewo. Yo da la yeewo.

Echoes are fun.

Time for our picnics.

Peppa loves picnics. Everyone loves picnics.

Where are the ducks? They always turn up when we have picnics.

Silly Peppa. Ducks don't live in the top of the mountains. Oh.

Hello, Mrs Duck, Would you like some bread?

The ducks are very lucky today. There's lots of bread. The ducks are eating too quickly.

Goodness me.

Home time. All aboard.

It's time to go home. Everybody has had a great time.

Let's all sing a song.

Can we have the Bing Bong song, please?

Oh oh.

Please, Madame Gazelle, sing the Bing Bong Song.

All right.

Ohhh, we're playing a tune, and we're singing a song with a bing and a bong and a bing.

Bong bing boo, bing bong bing, bing bong bingly bongly boo.

Bong bing boo, bing bong bing, bing bong bingly bungly boo.



It's the end of another lovely day. Peppa and George are playing with their friends, Rebecca and Richard Rabbit.

Home time! My little bunnies!


	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Rebecca Rabbit



But we want to play some more, Mummy.

Maybe tomorrow.

Can George and Peppa come to our house tomorrow?

Yes!

Hooray!

Why is Richard crying?

He has a bit scared of going down stairs.

Why?

We don't have stairs in our home.

What? No stairs?

That's right, you'll see tomorrow. Bye bye.

Bye bye!

It is morning. Peppa and George are going to Rebecca Rabbit's house today.

Mummy Pig can drive, and I'll do the map reading.

Are you sure, Daddy Pig?

We always get lost when you do the map reading.

We won't get lost.

Okay, is everybody ready?

Yes, Mummy Pig.

Then let's go.

Peppa and George are very excited. They have never been to Rebecca Rabbit's house before.

Daddy, are we nearly there?

The map says, Rebecca's house is on the next hill. I don't understand. There should be where Rebecca Rabbit lives

We must be lost, that's just a garden of carrots.

Where can Rebecca's house be?


Hello, everyone.

Rebecca.

Do you want to play in my bedroom?

Your bedroom? But where is your house?

Peppa can not see Rebecca's house anywhere.

This hill is our house. It's called a burrow.

Ooh!

I'll show you.

See you later.

See you later.

Come in. We don't have stairs. We have tunnels.

Rebecca's house is a bit different to Peppa's.

This is our bedroom.

You have a bed and a window and a toy box just like us.

Of course.

I like your house. I wish I was a rabbit.

I know. Should I teach you both how to be a rabbit?

Yes, please.

First, you have to twitch your nose and squeak, like this.

Squeak, squeak.

Very good, Peppa Rabbit and George Rabbit.

Peppa likes being a rabbit. George likes being a rabbit.

Rabbits like carrots. Delicious!

Mmm, Delicious!

Yuck!

George does not like carrots.

He won't even try them.

Oh well, more for us then.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Nature Trail



Rebecca, what else do rabbits like?

Rabbits like hopping. Come outside, I'll show you. Let's hop!

Rabbits like hopping.

You are very good rabbits.

Lunch time, children.

Mummy and Daddy Rabbit have prepared lunch.

Rebecca has taught us how to be rabbits.

You'll enjoy lunch then. It's our favorite carrots.

Delicious!

Delicious!

Yuck!

George will not eat carrots.

Oh, dear George, I thought you were a rabbit.

A rabbit loves carrots.

Squeak, squeak! Mmm.

Wow! George is eating a carrot.

This is our favorite cake, carrot cake.

Hooray!

Mmm, carrot cake.

George is a proper rabbit now.



Today, Peppa and her family are driving out to the countryside.

Daddy, what will we see in the countryside?

We'll see birds and trees and flowers and bees...

Dinosaur!

No, George, I don't think we'll see any dinosaurs.

This is the start of the nature trail.

We're here!



Horray!

Daddy Pig, don't forget the picnic.

As if I would.

Daddy, how do we know which way to go?

Easy. The map says there should be a sign showing the start of the nature trail... Here!

Well done, Daddy Pig.

Oh dear, Daddy Pig has forgotten the picnic.

Peppa, what interesting things can you see?

Just trees and trees and more boring trees.

Peppa, you're not looking hard enough.

Alright! I'll look really hard and I still won't see anything... Oh, what's that?

Peppa has found some footprints.

Whose footprints are these?

Dinosaur!

Oh, George, they're not dinosaur footprints.

Let's follow the footprints and see who made them.

Yes!

Shhh! We have to be very quiet, so we don't scare anything away.

Yes, Mummy. George, Shhh!

Shhh!

Peppa and George are following the footprints.

Look!

The footprints were made by a little bird.

She's flown into a tree.

Where?

Here, Peppa, look through the binoculars.

The binoculars make everything look bigger.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pen Pal



I can see one, two, three baby birds. Ah, I wonder what they're eating... Urgh! They're eating worms! That's disgusting!

George has found more footprints.

Ooof! What little footprints!

The footprint are being made by ants! They're collecting leaves to eat.

Are they going to have salad for lunch?

Yes.

Talking of lunch, let's have our picnic.

Oh, the picnic...

Daddy Pig! You've left the picnic in the car, haven't you?

Uh, yes... But it's not a problem. We'll just go back to the car to eat.

But which way is the car?

My map will show us. This way! Ooof! Who put that tree there? It's not on the map.

Oh, Daddy Pig! We're lost, aren't we?

Uh... yes.

How are we going to find our little car?

George has found more footprints.

Oooh, what big footprints?

Dinosaur!

Very interesting.

What? Has George found some real dinosaur footprints?

No, these are our footprints.

And if we follow our footprints, we'll find the way back to our car.

And our picnic!

Horray!

Nothing can stop us finding our car now. We're home and dry. Oh, I wasn't expecting that.


Luckily, I remembered the umbrella.

The rain is washing the footsteps away.

How are going to find the car now?

And our picnic...

It's the ducks! They always turn up at picnics.

Sorry, Mrs Duck, we haven't got a picnic this time.

We can't find it.

I know! Mrs Duck, can you help us find our picnic, please?

We're here!

Horray!

Thank you, Mrs Duck.

I love nature trails!

Yes, and I love picnics!

And the ducks love picnics!

And the little birds love picnics!

And the ants love picnics!

Everybody loves picnics.



Peppa and their friends are at their playgroup.

Children, who would like a pen pal?

Me!

What's a pen pal?

A pen pal is a boy or girl you can write letters to. This little girl lives in France. Her name is Delphine Donkey.

Can Delphine Donkey be my pen pal?

Of course, Peppa.

Hurray!



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pen Pal



It is early morning. Mr Zebra the postman is delivering a letter to Peppa's house.

Post!

Peppa and George love it when the post arrives.

It's addressed to Miss Peppa Pig.

That's me. Mummy, can you read it for me?

Of course. It's from Delphine Donkey.

My pen pal. What does she say?

Bonjour, Peppa. Comment ca va?

Mummy, why are you saying those funny words?

It's French, Peppa. It means, "Hello. How are you?"

What else does she say?

Mmm?

I'll help.

J'aime les princesses et jouer avec mes amis.

Clever daddy!

I am an expert at French.

What does it mean?

Um...

Daddy Pig cleans his glasses so he can see the letter more clearly.

Mmm. It's no good. It's nonsense.

It means, "I like fairy princesses and playing with my friends."

That's what I was going to say.

I want to talk French.

Maybe you could talk to Delphine Donkey.

How?

Her phone number is on this letter.

Yipee!


Bonjour. Est-il possible, que Peppa parle  Delphine?

Mummy Pig is asking if Peppa may speak to Delphine.

Hello.

Bonjour.

Bonjour. Um...what do I say next?

Comment ca va?

Comment ca va?

Bye bye.

Au revoir.

Au revoir.

What did she say?

She spoke French.

Bonjour, George. Comment ca va?

Peppa is saying "How are you?" in French.

Dinosaur. Grrr!

No, George. That's not how you speak French.

It is morning. Mr Zebra the postman is delivering letters to Peppa's house.

Post, Hooray! Can I have my letter from Delphine, please?

Sorry, Peppa. There's no letter for you today.

I wonder who that could be.

Bonjour. I am Delphine Donkey. I have come to see Peppa.

It's Delphine. Bonjour.

Bon jour, Peppa. Here are my maman and papa, and my brother Didier.

Bonjour.

Here are my Mummy and Daddy and my little brother George.

Hello.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Granny and Grandpa's Attic



Dinosaur. Grrr!

Dragon. Grrr!

Do you speak French, Mr Pig?

I'm an expert at French.

Parlez-vous sport? J'adore l'quipe de foot de Paris. Quelle est votre quipe de foot prfre?

Uh... yes.

Delphine, we could jump up and down in muddy puddles.

Delphine does not understand Peppa.

J'adore sauter dans les flasques de boue.

Peppa does not understand Delphine.

Everything's so different in French, Daddy.

Come on, Peppa.

J'adore sauter dans les flasques de boue.

Ah! That's what I was going to show you. We call it jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

We are jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Everyone in the whole world loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.



Peppa and George are playing at Granny and Grandpa's house today.

Hello, Grandpa Pig!

Papa 'ig!

Hello, Peppa. Hello, George.

Bye bye, see you later.

See you later.

Where's Granny Pig?

Hello, my little ones.

That is Granny Pig's voice, but where is she?


Granny Pig?

Here I am.

Granny Pig!

Ganny 'ig!

Why is Granny in the roof?

We're tidying the attic.

What's the attic?

It's where we keep all our old things.

Like you, Grandpa Pig?

Things that are even older than me.

Can we help?

OK!

Granny and Grandpa's attic is at the very top of the house.

That's the door to the attic.

How do we get up there?

I have a clever trick.

Hello, my little ones.

It's Granny!

Come on up!

Ooh!

This is our attic.

Wow!

It's very full!

Yes, it's full of old junk.

Peppa and George are here to help us throw some things out.

Good. Let's start by throwing out this box.

Oh! Not that box!

Do we really need this?

That's my ship in a bottle.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Quarrel



And this?

That's my other ship in a bottle.

And these?

They're my other ships in bottles. I need them all.

Well, we have to throw something out.

How about this box.

No! Not my hats!

Oh dear, we can't decide what to throw out.

I know! We'll let Peppa and George decide.

OK! Let's throw away this old case.

Ah! Not that one!

This isn't just any old case.

It's a record player.

Ooh.

And this was our favourite record.

Can we play it?

Yes!

We haven't heard it for years. This takes me back.

Come on, Peppa and George, let's dance!

Mummy Pig is here to pick up Peppa and George.

Hello? Where are you?

Mummy Pig can't find anyone.

What's that noise?

Mummy!

Hello!

We've been dancing to Granny and Grandpa's favorite record!

Yes. Granny and Grandpa played it all the time! Oh! And here's the record I used to play, when I was a little piggy.


What is it?

It's called "Birdie Birdie Woof Woof".

Not 'Birdie Birdie Woof Woof'! You were always playing that!

I thought we'd thrown that out ages ago.

The birds go woof! And the dogs go tweet! Woof tweet! Woof tweet! Woof! Woof! Woof!

The sheep go moo! And the cows go baa! Moo Baa!

Moo tweet! Moo Baa! Moo tweet! Woof! Woof! Woof!

Again again!

The birds go woof! And the dogs go tweet! Woof tweet! Woof tweet! Woof! Woof! Woof!

The sheep go moo! And the cows go baa! Moo Baa!

Moo tweet! Moo Baa! Moo tweet! Woof! Woof! Woof!

That was fun. But we were supposed to be finding some things to throw out!

Peppa, what hould we throw out and what should we keep?

Mmm, I think you should keep everything!



Peppa and Suzy Sheep are playing Snap.

Snap! I win!

Peppa and Suzy are best friends.

Snap! I win again!

You cheated!

I did not!

You looked at the card!

I did not!

I don't want to play with you anymore.

I don't want to play with you anymore.

Oh dear! Peppa and Suzy have had a quarrel.

Mummy Sheep is here to take Suzy home.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Quarrel



Peppa, say byebye to Suzy.

I am not talking to her.

And I am not talking to her.

Oh, I am sure they'll make it up. They are best friends really.

It is not funny.

We are not best friends anymore.

Daddy Pig is making supper.

Peppa, George, supper time. It's spaghetti. What's the matter, Peppa?

Peppa and Suzy have had a little quarrel.

But I do miss Suzy a bit.

Let's give Suzy a call.

Hello, Mrs Pig.

May Peppa talk with Suzy, please?

Hello, Suzy!

Hello, Peppa! We can be friends again if you say sorry.

I'm sorry I said you cheated, even though you did cheat.

Well, I'm sorry you were ever my best friend.

It doesn't matter. I can easily find a new best friend.

It's a lovely sunny day. All the children are at the playground.

Danny Dog is on the roundabout with his best friend Pedro Pony.

George is on the seesaw with his best friend Richard Rabbit.

Seesaw! Seesaw!

Suzy Sheep is on the swings, on her own. Peppa is playing mini golf, on her own.

Here is Emily Elephant.

Can I have a go?


Yes. Emily, Suzy Sheep is not my best friend anymore. So you can be my best friend.

But my best friend is Candy Cat.

Oh.

Whee!

Zoe, if you want, you can be my best friend.

But my best friend is Rebecca Rabbit.

Hello, Suzy!

Hello, Peppa.

Oh, good. I see you two are friends again.

We are not friends.

We will never be friends again.

I think it's about time you two make it up.

Peppa, say sorry to Suzy.

Only if she says sorry first.

Only if she says sorry first.

I know, I will count to three, and you can both say sorry at the same time.

All right!

One, two, three.

Sorry.

Now you can be best friends again.

Hooray!

Suzy, let's play mini golf.

Good idea!

Peppa and Suzy are best friends again.

Me first!

My go!

My ball went into the hole, so I win.

But my ball knocked it in, so I win.

You are just making the rules up.

You are making the rules up.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Toy Cupboard



I win!

No, I win!

Ho ho ho, You two are just the same.

That's why Suzy is my best friend in the whole world.

And Peppa is my best friend in the whole world ever.



It is Peppa and George's bedtime.

Goodness me, why are all these toys in your bed?

That's where they live.

Quickly, put the toys away in your toy basket.

But the toy basket is full.

Oh, so it is. Maybe you need a toy cupboard.

Yes, I could make one tomorrow.

The last thing you made, Daddy Pig, was this shelf.

I am very proud of that shelf.

But Daddy, it's all wobbly. We use it as a slide, for Teddy and Mr Dinosaur.

All right, let's buy a new toy cupboard.

We can buy one now on the computer.

Hooray!

Mummy Pig is using the computer to buy a toy cupboard.

Aha, now which one should we get?

Can we have this one, please?

That looks perfect.

Mummy Pig is buying the toy cupboard.

Congratulations, your toy cupboard is ordered.

Oh, goody.


It is morning. And the Mr Zebra the postman has a special delivery.

Post!

Special delivery for Miss Peppa Pig and Master George.

What is it?

It's a toy cupboard.

Oh, it looks a bit flat.

Yes, you build it yourself.

Oh...

Don't worry, Peppa. It'll be very easy for your mummy and daddy to build. Goodbye.

Bye bye.

Bye. Now what do we do?

Now we build your toy cupboard.

That's strange. There aren't any instructions.

Maybe it's so easy to build. It doesn't need instructions.

Mummy, can we help?

Yes, first, I need a shelf.

Here is a green shelf.

Thank you, Peppa. Now I need four legs.

One, two, three, four. Four blue legs, Mummy.

Lovely, we'll have this done in no time.

Here is a red door, Mummy Pig.

Thank you, Daddy Pig. There, finished.

Well done, Mummy Pig.

It's very tiny. How would all our toys fit inside?

It's a little small.

Oh, George has found another bit.

Uh, maybe that's a spare shelf.

And these would be spare too.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. School Camp



Oh, dear, the cupboard is tiny, because Mummy Pig has not used all the pieces.

We'll just have to take it apart and start again.

Oh, no. If only we have the instructions. Who can that be?

Hello, I've just found these in my van.

It's the missing instructions. That would make things a lot easier.

Hooray.

The instructions look very complicated.

It's no good. It's nonsense.

Leave it to me, Daddy Pig. I am quite enjoy putting these things together.

Really? Can we help it anyway?

You can put the kettle on. I'll have a nice cup of tea with six sugars, please

Everyone is preparing tea and biscuits for Mr Zebra.

Tea time, Mr Zebra. Wow...

Mr Zebra has built the toy cupboard.

My goodness, that was quick.

Yeah, and I've put all your toys in there too.

Thank you, Mr Zebra.

But there is no room for these last two.

Oh, poor Teddy and Mr Dinosaur. Where are they going to live?

Why not simply order another easy-to-make cupboard?

No!

I've got a better idea. Teddy and Mr Dinosaur can live on your beds.

But Mummy, that is where they lived before.

Yes, I know. That's why it's such a good idea.



Peppa and her friends are going on a school camp.

Madame Gazelle, I don't feel very well. The bus is very bumpy.

Oh, dear. Pedro Pony is feeling a bit travel sick.

Poor Pedro, come and sit in the front with me. There, is that better?

A little bit.

Madame Gazelle.

Oh, do you feel sick too, Zoe?

I might feel sick later. Can I sit at the front just in case?

Can I sit at the front too?

And me.

Oh, I'm sorry, children, you can't all sit at the front.

Oh!

Never mind, we are at the camp site now.

Hooray!

Happy camping, everyone.

Bye-bye!

Oh oh, this is our camp site. Breathe in the wonderful fresh air, children.

Excellent breathing! Now let's put up our tents.

Peppa and her friends are putting up their tents.

Children, you must each find a partner to share your tent.

Suzy, shall we share a tent?

I said I'd share with Zoe.

Oh, sorry Suzy, I said I'd share with Rebecca.

Rebecca, you said you'd share with me.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Captain Daddy Pig



Oh, yes.

Emily, who you are going to share tent with?

Zoe!

OK!

Good, now you can share with me.

OK!

Now I need sticks to make a camp fire.

We'll get sticks.

But me and Pedro want to get sticks.

Haha, you can all collect sticks.

Peppa and her friends collect sticks for the camp fire.

Wonderful!

It is night-time. Peppa and her friends are sitting around the camp fire.

Children, let us all sing a song.

Yes!

The Bing Bong song, please.

Oh, I am not sure.

Please, Madame Gazelle, sing the Bing Bong song.

Oh, we're playing a tune and we're singing a song. with a bing and a bong and a bing.

Bong bing boo, bing bong bing. Bing bong bingly bungly boo. Bong bing boo, bing bong bing. Bing bong bingly bungly boo.

Now, children, time for bed. Good night, children.

Good night, Madame Gazelle.

Peppa and suzy are in their sleeping bags.

I have got a torch.

Me too.


Attention, children. No more giggling please.

What was that funny noise?

I don't know. There it is again. Suzy, where are you going?

Madame Gazelle, I am a bit scared.

Would you like to come in?

Yes, please.

Madame Gazelle, I think I am a bit scared too. Can I come in, please?

Of course.

I think I might be scared later.

I might be scared later too.

And me.

Come in, everyone.

Can we have the Bing Bong song, please?

We are playing a tune and we're singing a song, with a bing and a bong and a bing.

Bong bing boo, bing bong bing. Bing bong bingly bungly boo. Bong bing boo, bing bong bing. Bing bong bingly bungly boo.


Peppa and her family are borrowing Grandpa's boat for the day.

Remember, Daddy Pig, push the lever forward to go forward.

Aye aye, Grandpa Pig. Forward.

And back to go back.

And Back, simple.

And please look after my boat. I just had it painted.

Oh, Grandpa Pig, what an old fusspot you are.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Captain Daddy Pig



Are my crew ready?

Yes, Captain Daddy Pig.

Then let's go.

Oh, the boat is moving backwards.

Ah, watch out for the bridge.

Oops!

Oh, that was close.

Byebye.

Peppa's Family: Byebye.

Have a lovely time.

I hope my boat comes back in one piece.

Stop worrying. It will be fine.

Peppa, ring the bell.

Aye aye, Captain Daddy.

I am a bit hungry.

So am I.

Granpa has left us a picnic in the galley.

What's a galley?

A galley is the boat's little kitchen. Follow me.

Peppa and George go inside the boat.

Wow!

What a tiny little kitchen.

Where's the picnic?

That obvious place would be here.

That's not the picnic.

And it must be here.

And that's not the picnic.

This kitchen has everything in the wrong place.

Wow! A TV.

Daddy can not find the picnic.

It's impossible.


If this was my kitchen, the picnic would be here,

Well done, Peppa.

Peppa has found the picnic.

Delicious!

Oh, it's the ducks. Hello, Mrs Duck. Would you like some bread?

Peppa and George love feeding bread to ducks.

Look out, long reeds ahead.

Don't worry, Grandpa's boat will easily go through them.

Are we stuck?

No, we can reverse.

Now are we stuck?

Yes.

Oh, dear, Grandpa's boat is stuck in the reeds.

I'll just give it a little push.

Do be careful, Daddy Pig.

I know what I'm doing. When I say go, start the engine.

Aye aye, Captain Daddy Pig.

Go!

Daddy Pig has pushed the boat out of the reeds.

Hooray!

Quick, Daddy, jump back on the boat.

Oh, no, Daddy Pig is being left behind.

Swim faster, Daddy.

Stop the engine.

What's he saying?

Stop the engine.

Daddy says, stop the engine.

Oh! Are you ok, Daddy Pig?

Yes, I'm fine. But let's head for home before we



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Powercut



have any more adventures.

Aye aye, Captain Daddy Pig.

They've been gone for ages. I hope my boat's alright.

Look, there they are.

Peppa's Family: Hello.

Ahoy, There!

I'll just park the boat.

You park a car, but you moor a boat. I'll show you.

Grandpa Pig is going to moor the boat.

The secret of mooring is to do it carefully.

Mind the bridge!

What?

Look behind you!

Ah! Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

Grandpa has broken his boat.

Never mind, Grandpa. You can have lots of fun mending it.

It is true that I love mending things.

Can I help mend the boat, Grandpa Pig?

Of course you can, Peppa.



It is evening. Peppa and George are in the sitting room dancing to their favorite song. Daddy Pig is in the hallway vacuuming the carpet. And Mummy Pig is in her study doing important work on her computer.

Oh.

Oh.

Oh.

Mummy, Daddy, It's gone all dark, and the music is broken.


And my vacuum won't work.

And my computer has switched off.

Ooh.

Mummy Pig tries the light switch, but the lights do not come on.

It must be a powercut.

What's a powercut?

A powercut is when there is no electricity.

What's "electrickety"?

Electricity is what makes everything in our house work.

Will the "electrickety" come back again?

Yes, but in the meantime, we need to find a torch.

I think there's a torch in the cellar.

OK, I'll go and get it.

Will you be OK, Daddy?

Ho ho, I'll be fine. I can see very well in the dark.

Who put that there?

Ooh.

Daddy, are you OK?

Yes, it's just a bit dark down here.

Oh, I've just remembered. I think the torch is in the kitchen.

Aha.

Mummy Pig has found the torch.

Can I hold the torch, Mummy?

Okay.

George, look at me.

Peppa is making a funny face.

Don't worry, George. It's only Peppa.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Bouncy Ball



Oh, we'd better tell Daddy we found the torch.

Daddy is still in the cellar, looking for the torch.

I'm sure it's here somewhere.

Daddy, we found the torch. Luckily, it was in the kitchen all the time.

What a stroke of luck.

Now we just have to wait until the electricity comes back.

How long will that be, exactly?

Um, I would say exactly... a long time.

Oh.

But George and I want to do some dancing. I know what we can do. We can watch some television. Oh, it won't go on.

The TV needs electricity too.

Does it?

Yes.

Oh. Now what are we going to do?

In the olden days, when there was no television, children would have to make up their own games.

Mmm... I know! I need a cardboard box.

What is Peppa doing?

Mummy, will you cut a hole in this box for me?

What for?

You'll see.

Mummy Pig is cutting a hole in the cardboard box.

There you are, Peppa.

Thank you. Now, you all have to sit down there.

And George, you have to point this torch at me.

Ahem. Welcome to Peppa Pig news with me, Peppa Pig.


Peppa has made her own television.

Today the whole world stopped working when there was a power cut, and all the "electrickety" was lost.

Very good, Peppa.

Daddy Pig says that the "electrickety" won't be back for a long long time.

Oh!

The electricity is back.

Hooray!

Shush! I haven't finished yet. Switch the lights off.

OK, Peppa.

Good. Ahem, I have some very important news. The queen has just found some more "electrickety" and says that everyone can now be happy again.

Very good, Peppa.

Hooray!

Let's dance!

Peppa quite enjoyed the powercut, but she's happy the electricity is back again.



Peppa and George are going to play in the garden with their ball.

Whee!

George throws the ball as high as he can and catches it.

I can do that too. Whee! Oh.

Peppa has missed the ball.

This is a silly game.

Here is Peppa's best friend, Suzy Sheep. Suzy has two tennis racquets.

Hello, Peppa.

Hello, Suzy.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Bouncy Ball



Let's play tennis.

Yes, that sounds fun. To you, Suzy.

Oh.

Suzy has missed the ball.

Oh.

Peppa has missed the ball.

Peppa and Suzy like playing tennis. But George feels a bit left out.

Oh, sorry, George, you can't play tennis. We only have two racquets.

I know, George can be the ball boy.

Yes, it is a very important job.

George is going to be the ball boy. He has to collect the ball when it is hit too far.

To you, Suzy.

Oh, missed it.

Ball boy...

Thank you, ball boy.

Oh.

Ball boy...

Thank you, ball boy.

Ball boy...

Oh, dear, George doesn't like this game.

Here are Danny Dog, Pedro Pony, Candy Cat, Rebecca Rabbit and Richard Rabbit.

Hello, everyone.

Peppa's Friends: Hello.

We are playing tennis.

Can we play too?

But there aren't enough racquets.

Peppa's Friends: Oh.

Let's play something else.


Let's play football.

Yes, football.

Girls against boys.

We each need a goalkeeper.

Me, me!

Me, me!

Pedro Pony and Rebecca Rabbit will be the goalkeepers.

We'll start.

Goal!

Richard Rabbit has scored a goal.

The boy is winning.

That's not fair. We weren't ready.

Hi, that's cheating. You can't hold the ball.

Yes, I can. I am the goalkeeper.

Go, Rebecca, go!

Goal.

Hooray!

The goal is not allowed.

Yes, it is.

No, it isn't.

Yes, it is.

No, it isn't.

What a lot of noise!

Daddy, the boys are cheating.

No, the girls are cheating.

It sounds like you need a referee.

What's a referee?

It's someone who make sure that everyone plays fair.

I'll be the referee. Me... me... me...




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Stars



Stop! Stop! I'll be the referee. The next team to get a goal will win the game.

Hooray!

Where's the ball?

Quick! Score a goal.

Stop them.

Goal! Richard Rabbit has scored a goal.

Hooray!

The boys win.

Oh.

Football is a silly game.

Just a moment, the boys scored in their own goal. That means the girls win.

Really?

Hooray.

Football is a great game.



It is almost time for bed. Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and Peppa are having mugs of hot milk.

George, why are you dressing up in that space suit? You should be in your pajamas.

George loves everything to do with space.

Oh.

George, take your space helmet off to drink your milk.

Bed time, little ones.

At night, George likes to listen to his space mobile.

No space again, it's boring.

Space isn't boring  it is full of stars.

I can't see anything  it's too dark.

It's easier to see the stars from the outside.


Can we go outside now?

Peppa, you are in your pajamas.

Maybe if you put your coats on over your pajamas, we could go outside just this once.

Hooray!

Daddy, why are you lying on the ground?

This is the best way to see the stars.

Look at these little stars, imagine you are joining the dots.

That's call the Big Dipper.

Yes, and the two stars at the end point to the North Star.

Wow! North Stars, North Star, are you near or are you far? Can we get that in the car?

No, Peppa, the star is much too far away.

Are they further away than the seaside?

Oh, yes. But they look a lot closer through a telescope.

Have we got a telescope?

No, but Grandpa Pig has a very good telescope.

Can we go to Grandpa Pig's house now

It's much too late.

Maybe we can go just this once, Daddy Pig.

Hooray.

It's the first time Peppa and George have been in the car at night.

Look, we are following the North Star.

North Star, North Star, shining with a twinkly glow.

Please show us which way to go.

Peppa and George has arrived at Grandpa and Granny Pig's house.

Oh, dear. I do hope Grandpa and Granny Pig haven't gone to bed.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Daddy Pig's Birthday



What are you doing here at this hour?

We want to see the stars.

Peppa and George were hoping they can look through your telescope.

I see, very well. To the top of the house, everyone. Here she is, old Bess.

Wow!

Grandpa Pig's hobby is looking at the stars.

Now who's for the first look?

Me, me, me! Oh, the North Star.

We sailor uses it to find our way home.

Daddy used it to find his way here.

Are there other things in the sky?

Yes, this is the planet call Saturn.

What are those pretty rings?

They are made of rock and ice. Saturn is very very cold.

We can build a snowman, George.

Quick, look!

Oh...

It's a shooting star. You must make a wish.

I wish that when George is old enough to have his own rocket he will take me into space.



Today is Daddy Pig's birthday. Daddy Pig has to go to work.

Daddy, I wish you did't have to work on your birthday.

So do I, but I'll be home as soon as I can. See you later.

See you later.

While Daddy Pig is at work, we can get all his


birthday surprises ready.

First, we'll make Daddy's birthday cake. We start with butter and sugar and flour, then we add an egg. And most important of all, the chocolate bits.

Mummy Pig is making a chocolate cake. Daddy Pig loves chocolate cake.

I give it a stir.

Mummy, can I stir?

Yes, Peppa.

Peppa loves stirring. George wants a go.

Okay, George, that's enough stirring. There, Daddy Pig's chocolate cake.

Hooray!

Now we just have to bake it in the oven.

Mummy, can I lick the spoon?

Yes, you can lick the spoon and George can lick the bowl.

Yippee.

Peppa and George love chocolate cake mixture.

Poor Daddy Pig, he's missing all the fun.

Mummy, can I ring Daddy at work and say happy birthday?

That's a nice idea.

This is the office where Daddy Pig works.

Hello, Mr Rabbit speaking.

May I speak to Daddy Pig, please?

Someone for you, Daddy Pig. It sounds important.

Hello, Daddy Pig speaking.

Happy birthday, Daddy. Happy birthday!

Thank you, Peppa.

Don't be late home, Daddy, byebye

Bye bye.




	 




That's just one more thing to do before Daddy gets home.

Yes, Daddy Pig's birthday surprise. Shhhh... George, remember, It is a secret.

Shhhh...

Peppa and George have buckets of water. Mummy Pig has balloons. I wonder what Daddy Pig's birthday surprise can be.

Daddy's home.

Quick, back to the house.

Daddy Pig is home from work.

Happy birthday, Daddy Pig.

Thank you, everyone. Wow, what a lot of candles.

That's because you are very very old, Daddy. You must blow out all your candles in one go.

I'll do my best.

Hooray!

And here's your birthday present.

Thank you, new boots, fantastic! Let's try them out.

Peppa, George and Mummy Pig are wearing their boots. Daddy Pig is wearing his birthday boots.

Daddy Pig has found a little puddle.

Let's see if the boots work.

The puddle is a bit too little for Daddy Pig.

Mmm, what I need is a big puddle.

Why not try over here, Daddy Pig

Oh, what's this?

It's your special birthday surprise. Shhh...

Shhh...


Fantastic! My birthday boots work perfectly. Would you care to join me in my birthday muddy puddle?

Daddy Pig loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles. Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

This is my best birthday ever.



It is night time. Peppa is going to a sleepover at Zoe Zebra's house.

Hello, Zoe.

Hi, Peppa. Welcome to my sleepover.

I'll pick you up in the morning. Bye bye, Peppa.

Peppa Pig Season 	. Sleepover



But it was a bit boring, Daddy.

Daddy Zebra is going to bed now. He has to get up early to deliver the post.

Very well, Mummy Zebra.

Don't stay up too late.

Good night, Mummy.

Peppa and her friends are getting into their sleeping bag.

Zoe's baby twin sisters Zuzu and Zaza want to join the sleepover too.

But the sleepover is only for big girls.

They are so sweet and little.

Can they stay?

OK, but you must promise you'll stay awake.

We promise.

Wow, a piano.

I am having lessons, listen. Twinkle twinkle little star...

Can I have a go?

And me.

Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are...

Shush, you must be quiet, so Daddy Zebra can sleep. Now into your sleeping bags please.

What do we do now?

On sleepovers, there's always a midnight feast.

What's a midnight feast?

We eat things in secret.

Ooh.

I know where's the food, but we must be very quiet.

Shhh, Suzy.

Shhh, Peppa.

Quiet.


Mummy Zebra has woken up.

We are going to have the best midnight feast ever.

What's going on? You'll wake Daddy Zebra.

Now who knows a nice gentle bedtime story.

Me!

Peppa's Friends: And me!

I'll start. Once upon a time, there was a little fairy.

Now your turn, Peppa.

And she lived in the forest.

She was very pretty.

And she had a fairy wand.

Lovely.

Your turn, Emily. Tell us what happens next.

Well, I am not very sure.

Just say anything, Emily.

As long as it isn't boring.

OK, the little fairy met a big monster, who went...

roar...

Eek! Too scary!

What's all these noise?

Oh, dear, the noise has woken Mr Zebra.

Sorry, Daddy, there was a story about a fairy.

And a scary monster.

And we want to know what happens next.

Very well. The monster lifted up his big hairy paws... and walked along on his big hairy feet.

Ooh!.

And he said, "Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are..."

Mr Zebra's song has sent everyone to sleep.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Cold Winter Day




It is very cold today. Peppa and George are wearing their hats, scarves, coats, mittens and boots.

Look, George, the trees haven't got leaves.

In the winter time, the trees lose their leaves. Peppa and George had found a muddy puddle. Peppa and George love jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Me first.

It is so cold, the puddle has turned to ice. It is very slippery.

It's not funny.

Here are Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig.

Good, a muddy puddle.

Daddy Pig loves jumping in muddy puddles.

Stop, Daddy.

That was close. Lucky I've got such a good sense of balance.

Daddy, the puddles are icy today, we can't jump in them.

Never mind. Let's feed some bread to the ducks.

Hooray!

Peppa and George love feeding the ducks.

Hello, ducks. We've got some bread for you.

The ducks like bread. It's so cold, the pond has frozen to ice. The ice is very slippery.

Sorry for laughing, Mrs Duck. But it did look quite funny.

It is starting to snow.

Snow!

Peppa and George love snow.

George, let's catch snowflakes.

Peppa and George are catching snowflakes.


Ooh.

George has caught a snowflake. Peppa has caught a snowflake.

Ooh.

Here is Suzy Sheep on her toboggan.

Hello, Peppa.

Wow. Suzy, that looks fun.

We are all tobogganing on the big hill. There is lots of snow there.

Shall we climb up the big hill and watch the tobogganing?

Yes, please.

Peppa's friends are tobogganing on the big hill.

Oh, dear, George has slipped on the hill.

You look funny, George.

George does not think it is funny.

It's quite easy to slip on the hill. Maybe I should carry George.

Daddy, can you carry me too?

All right, Peppa.

Just be careful you don't slip over, Daddy Pig.

Don't worry, Mummy Pig, remember I've got a excellent sense of balance.

Let's have a race.

Yes!

Ready, steady, go!

Peppa's Friends: Wheeeee...

Here we are. The top of the big hill.

Do be careful you don't slip, Daddy Pig.

I am not going to slip. Wow...

No!

You find treasure.

There is something over here.

Have you found the rainbow's treasure?

Yes. I have.

A big muddy puddle!

Hurray!

This is the best rainbow treasure ever.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pedro's Cough



Ha, ha, ha...



It is a school day. Peppa and her friends are having a music lesson.

Miss Polly had a dolly.

Sorry, Madame Gazelle.

Oh dear, Pedro has a cough.

Don't worry. I'll ring doctor Brown Bear.

Doctor Brown Bear, speaking.

Hello doctor, this is Madame Gazelle. A child is ill.

Don't panic. I'll come straight away.

What seems to be the problem?

I've got a cough.

I see. Is it a tickly cough or a chesty cough?

I don't know, but it goes like this.

And when did you get this cough?

When Madame Gazelle started singing.

It's nothing serious, but Pedro's cough may be catching.

What do you mean "catching"?

When one person has a cough, sometimes other people get that cough, too.

Do I need medicine?

Just a little spoonful. I'm afraid it doesn't taste very nice.

Urgh! It tastes like an old shoe full of jam.

Thank you Doctor Brown Bear.

Goodbye.

Bye.

As I thought, Pedro's cough is catching.


Danny Dog and Suzy Sheep have caught Pedro's cough.

Open wide.

Urgh! It tastes of carpet-flavored yogurt.

Urgh! It tastes of flowers.

Well-done for taking your medicine so well.

Do you ever get ill, Doctor Brown Bear?

No, Peppa. I'm never ill. I eat an apple a day. Goodbye.

Bye.

It is home time, and the children's parents are here to pick them up.

Mummy, daddy, I've got a cough.

Doctor Brown Bear came to look after us.

He gave us horrible medicine.

Madame Gazelle, can you sing your song now?

Of course, Peppa. Wooo... Miss Polly had a dolly who was...

Oh, dear, all the grown-ups have got Petro's cough.

Doctor Brown Bear speaking.

This is Peppa pig. All the grown-ups are ill.

Not to worry, Peppa. I'm on my way.

Hello, everyone. Caught Petro's cough, have we?

Very well. Stand in a line and open wide.

Urgh! It tastes like custard and old socks.

Thank you for looking after us, Doctor Brown Bear.

Who looks after you when you're ill?

No one looks after me. I'm never ill.

Oh, dear. Doctor Brown Bear has caught Petro's cough.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Library



Not to worry, goodbye.

Goodbye.

Poor Doctor Brown Bear. He is ill and there is no one to look after him.

Oh.

Who can that be?

Hello, we've come to look after you.

Here is some fruit.

And some cushions.

Here is your medicine.

Urgh! It tastes like jammy-yogurt-flavored custard socks.

And here is a song to make you feel better. Woooooo...

Miss Polly had a dolly who was sick, sick, sick. So she called for the doctor to be quick, quick, quick. The doctor came with his hat and his bag. And he knocked on the door with a rat-a-tat-tat.


It is bed time.

Good night Peppa, good night George.

Can I have a story, please?

Ok. I will read you the Red Monkey book.

But we always have that one, the Red Monkey has a bath, cleans his teeth and goes to sleep.

Eh... yes, that's what happens.

Can we choose another story?

The blue tiger, the green spider, the orange penguin. Oh, what's this one?

The wonderful world of concrete.

I've been looking for that!

Is it your book, Daddy?


It's a book I borrowed from the library

What's the library?

It's a place you borrow books from and when you finish reading them, you take them back.

But Daddy Pig has forgotten to take this book back.

I have had it for rather a long time.

Never mind, you can take it back tomorrow, but now it's bed time.

After Dad reads this story.

It's not much of the story, Peppa.

Please read it, daddy.

Ok. The wonderful world of concrete. Concrete is a construction material composed of sand, water and chemical admixtures. Chapter one, sand.

Peppa, George and Mummy Pig have fallen asleep.

It is the morning, Peppa and her family have come to the library

Wow, what's a lot of books!

Peppa, you must be quiet in the library.

Why?

Because people come here to read and to be quiet.

Next please!

Miss Rabbit is the librarian.

Hello Mummy Pig, are you returning these books?

Yes, Miss Rabbit.

Right you are.

Why is the computer beeping?

It's checking to see that you haven't been naughty in borrowing the book for too long.

I may have borrowed this book for a bit too




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Camper Van



long.

Don't worry, Daddy Pig. It can't be that bad.

Gosh, Daddy Pig you've had this book out for ten years!

Naughty daddy!

Sorry Miss Rabbit.

That's all right. Now you can borrow another book.

Miss Rabbit, can George and I borrow a book please?

Yes, the children section is over here.

Oh look, fairies, flowers, pretty dresses ...

Hello Peppa.

Hello, Danny.

I am borrowing book about football

Hello, Peppa!

Hello, Suzy!

I've got a book about nursing.

George has chosen a book about dinosaurs.

Dinosaur, gee!

Look what I've found, Further Adventures in the World of Concrete!

Here is a red monkey book.

Not the red monkey book. It's boring!

But this is a different story. It might be more fun.

I bet it's not.

Once upon a time, there was a red monkey.

Oh. He had a bath, cleaned his teeth and went to bed.

No, he jumped into a space rocket and went to the moon.

He had a picnic with the dinosaur, swam


under the sea and climbed the highest mountain.

That was a busy day. The end.

Wow! Read it again.

We can borrow it and read it at home, Peppa.

But I was going to choose this book or this one.

You can take three books home if you want, Peppa.

Yippee!

But you must remember to bring them back on time.

Yes, Miss Rabbit.

And you must remember to bring your book back, too, Daddy Pig.

I'll make sure daddy remembers.

Yes Peppa .I'm sure you will. Ho ho.



Peppa and George are very excited today. They are going on holiday.

Oh where is daddy?

He is bringing a secret surprise.

What's that?

It's a camper van.

We've borrowed it for a holiday.

This camper van has everything. This button works the sink.

Wow!

And this button works the TV.

What does this button do?

I am not sure. Maybe don't press it until we know.

Is everybody ready to go on holiday?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Camper Van



Yes, Mummy Pig.

Then let's go!

We are going on holiday in a camper van.

Ho ho ho.

En, this map is a bit tricky.

Daddy, we don't want to get lost.

Don't worry, Peppa. I'm an expert in map reading. Oh, that's strange.

Are we lost?

Err, yes.

It's Granddad Dog with Danny dog.

Hello Peppa,

Hello Danny. We're lost.

Lost? Is your sat-nav broken?

Sat-nav?

You are driving a camper van T.

Sat-nav comes a standard.

Welcome to the car of the future.

Ah, so that's what that button does.

Where are we going today?

The camper van is talking.

Clever, isn't it? The computer's voice helps you find your way.

But how does it know where we want to go?

You tell it.

Hello Mrs Camper Van.

Hello.

We're going on a holiday. Can you tell us the way?

Proceed on the current road in a straight line.

Thanks for your help, Granddad Dog.

You are welcome. Have a lovely holiday!


We're going on a holiday in a camper van.

Danger, danger, oil is low.

What's oil?

Oil helps engines to run smoothly.

Will the oil run out?

No, these warnings always give you plenty of time.

Oil is gone.

Oh dear.

Luckily I've got a spare can of oil.

Well done, Daddy Pig.

We simply pour the oil into the engine and oh...

What's wrong?

There's nothing in here. The engine's gone.

It's Mummy Sheep with Suzy Sheep.

Hello Suzy!

Hello Peppa!

We've lost our engine.

Lost your engine?

Yes, it's completely disappeared.

I'd like to help, but I don't know a thing about engines. I'm probably just being silly, but this looks a bit like an engine?

Ah, yes, well-spotted Mummy sheep.

The camper van has its engine at the back.

There, that should be enough oil. Thank you Mummy Sheep!

You are welcome. Have a lovely holiday!

Are we near there yet?

Just up the next hill. You have reached your destination.

Hooray!



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Camping Holiday



Time for bed.

Where will we sleep?

Mummy Pig and I will sleep on this bed.

And you two will sleep upstairs.

But there isn't an upstairs.

Watch this.

The camper van's roof is lifting up.

The camper van is just like our little house.

While we are on holiday, it is our little house.

Good night, my little piggies.

Good night.



Peppa's family are on a holiday in their camper van.

Good morning, my little piggies.

Good morning, Daddy Pig.

I love camping.

Since we are in the countryside, I thought we can spend the day looking at nature.

Good idea! Mummy Pig. Let's watch a nature program.

One of the wonders of nature-birds.

How lovely.

Aha aha...

Shoo, shoo, little birdy, we can't hear our TV.

Oh! Daddy Pig, there is no point being on a camping holiday and just watching TV. We can do that at home.

Mmm... Good thinking, Mummy Pig.

There're lots of fun places we can visit.

There's tree world.

What's tree world?


Tree world is a big forest full of trees.

It sounds a bit boring.

Or there is potato city?

What's potato city?

There's a tour with potato fields ending with a potato tasting.

Sounds interesting.

Or there is Duckland.

What's Duckland?

It's a wide river full of ducks.

Duckland! Let's go to Duckland.

Peppa and George love ducks.

How do we get to Duckland?

The camper van can guide us.

Hello! Where are we going today?

Duckland, please.

Follow the road ahead in a straight line.

We're going to Duckland in a camper van.

Welcome to Duckland. How many tickets please?

Two adults and two children.

Enjoy the ducks.

Where are the ducks?

Maybe they are on holiday.

Let's have our picnic lunch. The ducks always turn up...

When we have picnics.

Peppa and George love picnics.

Look! It's the duck. Stop, daddy. We need bread for the ducks.

Ho ho, all right.

Hello, Mrs Duck!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Compost



Here come more ducks.

All the brothers and sisters are here.

And here come more ducks.

It's the Granny and Grandpa ducks.

And here are all the aunties and uncles.

That's the last of our picnic gum.

Ducks, say thank you to Daddy Pig.

You are most welcome.

I love Duckland.

It is time to go home.

I wonder what's the shortest way home.

Drive straight ahead into the river.

Oh! Are you sure?

Yes, drive into the river.

But we can't drive in the river.

Yes, it's talking nonsense.

Please press the blue button.

The camper van is driving into the river.

Our camper van has turned into a boat.

I wasn't quite expecting that.

Welcome to the car of the future.

Look! It's Granddad Dog and Danny Dog.

Ahoy, there! Daddy Pig.

Ahoy, there.

Sailing on a river in a camper van.

Drive up the next hill.

You have reached your destination.

We are home.

Thank you for your lovely holiday, Mrs Camper van.

Ho ho. You are most welcome.

It's nice going on a holiday, but it's nicer to be


backing our own little house.

Good night my little piggies.

Good night.



Daddy Pig is making vegetable soup for lunch.

Daddy, can I help?

Thank you, Peppa. Can you clear away all these vegetable peelings?

Ok.

Stop, Peppa. Vegetable peelings don't go in the normal bin. They go in this brown bin.

Ooh.

Banana.

That's right, George. It's a banana skin.

And there are onions and carrots and all sorts of fruit and vegetable leftovers in here.

Granny and grandpa will like these.

Do granny and Grandpa Pig eat potato peelings?

Ha ha ha. No, Peppa.

They're for grandpa's garden. They help his plants grow.

Oh!

We can take these round there after lunch.

Oh, goody.

He he he...

Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are taking the vegetable peelings over to granny and grandpa pigs' house.

We are here.

Hurray!

Grandpa Pig.

Papa Ig.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Compost



We've got a special present for you.

Ah. Vegetable peelings. Fantastic. My garden will like these.

Does your garden eat vegetables?

Ho ho. No, Peppa. These peelings are for my compost heap.

What's that?

I'll show you. Here it is.

It's a wooden box.

Yes, Peppa. But it's a very clever wooden box.

I put these peelings in the top and then out of the bottom comes lovely rich earth called 'compost'.

How does it do that? Is it a magic box?

Ho ho. No, Peppa. I've got some little friends that give it some help.

Where?

In here. Look

Ah. Wiggly worms.

Wiggle, wiggle.

The worms turn all the fruit and vegetables into compost.

Grandpa, can we find some more wiggly worms for your composting?

What a good idea!

Come on, George. Let's find some more wiggly worms.

A wiggly worm.

Wiggle! Wiggle!

You are a wiggly worm. You are a wiggly worm.

How do you do? I love you. You are a wiggly worm.

Ha ha! Well done!

Be a good wiggly worm. And turn it all into compost.


Then, I can use the compost to...

I know, I know. You put a seed in the ground, cover it in compost, and then it grows into a tree.

Ho ho. Yes, Peppa.

And talking of trees, we'd better go and help Granny Pig. She's collecting fruit in the orchard.

What's the orchard?

It's where you find fruit trees. We've had this orchard since i was a little piggy.

He he.

Hello, Granny Pig.

Ganny Ig.

Are you going to help me collect some apples?

Yes, granny. Oh, the apples are too high up.

Don't worry, Peppa. Granny and grandpa have a little trick to collect the apples.

Everybody hold on to the tree

On the count of three, shake the tree as much as you can.

One, two, three!

It's raining apples!

Ha ha.

Granny, can we have an apple, please?

Of course, Peppa.

Mm... delicious.

And can you guess what we do with the apple cores?

Eh...

Wiggle, wiggle!

That's right. The apple cores go into the compost for the worms.

Clever George.

And clever wiggly worms, too.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Richard Rabbit Comes to Play




Peppa and George are playing in their bedroom.

This will be the best house ever!

George, Richard Rabbit is here.

George!

Richard!

Dinosaur!

Dinosaur!

Bye bye, Richard. I'll be back to pick you up later!

George and Richard are best friends.

George! Richard! You've knocked my house down.

Please play something not bouncy.

Ha ha ha!

George has made the toy basket into a volcano.

Richard is using toy trees to make a jungle.

George has used building blocks to make a river.

Dinosaur!

Dinosaur!

George and Richard have turned the bedroom into dinosaur land.

I leave it. It's too noisy.

I say potato. And I say potato. Potato! Potato! Potato!

Potato!

The good thing about rainy days is we get to watch important TV programs.

Potato! Potato! Potato!

Mummy, George and Richard have made the bedroom into dinosaur land. And dinosaur land is very noisy.

George has his best friend here, but I've got no one to play with.

You could ask Suzy Sheep to come over.


Suzy Sheep is Peppa's best friend.

Can Suzy really come over now?

Let's ring her.

Hello, Suzy Sheep's speaking.

Suzy, it's me. Can you come to my house now?

Yes, Peppa! Can I wear my nurse's costume?

Yes, but come quickly.

Bye bye, Suzy! I'll be back to... pick you up later.

George! Richard! Nurse Suzy is here.

And Nurse Suzy says this is not dinosaur land. It's a hospital. And a hospital must be clean and tidy.

The bedroom is not dinosaur land anymore. It is a hospital.

I am an important doctor. This dinosaur looks sick.

I agree, doctor. He's a very greeny-ill color. He must go to bed.

And this dinosaur looks very purply-ill color.

Yes, doctor. He must go to bed, too.

Dinosaur!

Sh-sh! Quiet in the hospital.

Choo choo!

The bedroom is not a hospital any more. Now it's a railway station.

No! No! There aren't any trains in fairyland.

Oh, now the bedroom is fairyland.

Only pretty things are allowed in fairyland.

What's all this crying about?

George and Richard want to play dinosaurs and trains.

And we want to play hospitals and fairies.

Uh, I see the rain has stopped outside.

So?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Fun Run



So maybe you could all play outside.

But they like little boys' games.

And we like grown-up girls' games.

But after it's been raining in the garden, what you normally find...

Muddy?

Puddles!

And what are muddy puddles for?

Jumping up and down in!

Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddly puddles whether they're big girls or little boys.



It has been very stormy weather and the school roof is leaking.

How can we raise the money to fix the school roof?

We could have a fun run.

What's a funny run?

It's a day for picnics and giving money to see people run. And the more money you give, the further they run.

Good idea, Daddy Pig! How far can you run?

What? Eh...well, I can run as far as you like.

But daddy, you can hardly run at all!

Nonsense! I am an expert at running!

Good. Does anyone else want to run?

No, thank you!

But I will give money to see Daddy Pig run!

Me too!

And me!

Excellent! Thank you, Daddy Pig!


Peppa and her family are eating spaghetti.

Delicious! Is there any more spaghetti?

Daddy Pig! You've already had three

helpings!

Eating gives me energy. And I need energy for my fun run.

You also need to practice running.

What if I practice eating today, then practice running tomorrow?

No, daddy. You need to practice running now.

Oh.

Come on daddy! Race you!

This is easy.

It is easy to run downhill. It is hard to run uphill.

I don't think I should've eaten so much spaghetti.

It is the day of the fun run. Madame Gazelle has a chart to show how far Daddy Pig must run.

If Daddy Pig can run to here.

The supermarket!

Then to here.

my granddad's garage.

And all the way to here.

Windy castle.

Then we will have enough money to fix the school roof.

I will do it now. Ready, steady, go! I did it! Now we can have the picnic.

Silly daddy! That is just a drawing.

Yes, now you must run to the real windy castle.

Oh.

Ready, steady, go!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Washing



Hooray!

Come on, Daddy Pig! You can make it!

Come on, bus! You can make it!

The school bus has made it to the windy castle.

Now everyone can enjoy the picnic.

Water... water...

What a lovely hot day!

It's such a relaxing way to raise money, too!

Water...

Daddy Pig has reached the supermarket. All running makes him very thirsty.

Let's look through the telescope.

I can see daddy.

The telescope makes everything look closer.

He's not going very fast.

Daddy Pig has arrived at Granddad Dog's garage.

That's it. I can't go on!

Daddy has stopped.

Oh.

You look rather hot. You need something to cool you down and give you energy. Have an ice lolly.

Thank you! Granddad Dog. That's nice...

A wasp! Shoo, shoo, get away, you little pest.

The wasp wants to share Daddy Pig's ice lolly.

No, this is my lolly.

Daddy starts running again, really fast.

Hooray!

Oh, get off! Get off!

You can stop now, Daddy Pig. We have enough money to fix the school roof.

Ah...


Daddy Pig has lost the wasp.

Well done. Daddy Pig. All that extra running means we've got enough money for a new school bus too.

Thank you, Daddy Pig.

Ho ho. You're most welcome.



Daddy Pig is doing the washing this morning.

Daddy, what's that shirt?

It's my football shirt.

Daddy's playing football this afternoon.

Wow!

But first I have to go to work. See you later!

Bye!

Bye-Bye!

Poor Daddy, having to go to work.

Oh, poor Daddy!

Come on! Let's play!

Yes, let's play.

Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles. George loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles. Mummy Pig loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles. Oh, dear.

Mummy! We splashed daddy's football shirt with mud.

Oh. Don't worry! We'll just wash it.

It will be washed in no time. And daddy won't know it was ever muddied.

Let's find more things to put in the machine.

Oh, my dress is a bit muddy.

Mummy Pig and George have found more things to wash.

Very good, George. We put the clothes in




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Polly's Boat Trip



here. And then we switch it down.

The washing machine is filling up with hot, soapy water.

Splosh. Splosh. Splosh.

The washing machine is making the whole room shake.

Oh, Peppa, where's your dress?

I am washing it.

What? Oh, no.

Look Mummy, my red dress is all nice and clean.

Yes, Peppa. But look what it's done to everything else.

Oh dear, Peppa's white dress has made all the white clothes pink.

Pink isn't a very good color for a football shirt.

Oh.

Daddy Pig is home from work.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Daddy.

Eh, Daddy Pig, we've got a bit of a problem and mm...

Tell me later, Mummy Pig. I have to get ready for football. Now, where's my football shirt.

Here.

Don't be silly, Peppa. That's one of Mummy's dresses. It's pink.

No, Daddy. It's your football shirt.

It's got a bit muddy.

So we washed it.

And it all went a bit wrong. Sorry, Daddy.

But I can't wear a pink football shirt.

Why not, Daddy? Pink is a lovely color.


What do you think, George?

Yuk.

George does not like pink.

Here are Daddy Pig's friends, Mr Bull, Mr Rabbit, Mr Pony and Mr Zebra.

Moo! Is Daddy Pig coming out to play?

He'll just be in a moment.

My team are in white. I need a white shirt.

But Daddy, you have the white shirt. Just take off your jacket. See?

Fantastic! Thank you, Peppa.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Daddy Pig.

I like your shirt!

Very smart!

Thank you. Come on, let's play football.

Yes!

Goal!

Hurray!

Hurray!

Daddy, you've made your shirt all muddy!

Of course, Peppa. Football shirts are meant to be muddy.

Daddy Pig loves playing football. Everyone loves playing football, especially when it's muddy.



Grandpa Pig is taking Peppa and George on a boat trip. Polly Parrot is going, too.

Grandpa Pig, have you got your mobile phone?

Yes, Granny Pig.

Don't drop it in the water.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Polly's Boat Trip



No, Granny Pig.

Is it switched on?

Yes, Granny Pig.

Bye!

Bye-bye!

Here is Granddad Dog.

Ahoy there.

Woof! Ahoy there. Lovely day to go sailing.

I would go, too. But my boat needs to clean.

I don't know why you bother cleaning that rusty boat. I'm surprised it's still afloat.

This rusty boat will still be afloat long after your old tin boat has sunk to the bottom of the river.

Granddad Dog is Grandpa Pig's very best friend.

Full steam ahead! Goodbye!

I am the captain of this boat, and when the captain tells you to do something, you must do it.

Aye aye, Captain!

Aye aye, Captain!

Polly Parrot copies everything that they said.

George, raise the flag.

George, raise the flag.

Peppa, ring the bell.

Peppa, ring the bell.

Grandpa, can I be the captain, please?

OK. But as a captain, you must wear this hat.

Now Peppa is the captain, and everyone must do what she says.

Ring the bell. Turn that wheel.

Aye aye, Captain Peppa.

Jump up and down.

Captain Peppa is a bit bossy.


Perhaps I should be the captain again. We don't want a crash into anything.

Steering the boat can be tricky. Luckily, I'm good at steering.

Oh dear. Grandpa Pig's boat has crashed into a little island.

Grandpa, we're stuck.

I'll ring Granny Pig. She can get help.

Wow, oh. Grandpa Pig has dropped his phone in the water.

Granny Pig speaking. Hello? Hello. Hello.

Somehow, we need to get a message to granny.

Message to granny.

Polly can fly to granny.

Good idea, Peppa! And I can teach Polly what to say.

Grandpa Pig says.

Grandpa Pig says.

Help, help!

Help, help!

There you see, easy peasy.

Grandpa Pig says easy peasy.

You silly old bird.

You silly old bird.

Hello, Polly. What are you doing here?

Grandpa Pig says.

What does Grandpa Pig say?

You silly old bird.

Oh!

Help, help!

Goodness me, grandpa must need help!

Granddad Dog.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Delphine Donkey



Hello, Granny Pig.

Grandpa Pig needs help. Please, could you rescue him?

Madam, I would be delighted.

Hurray!

Ahoy there. Do you need rescuing, captain?

En, maybe.

Would you like my rusty old boat to rescue you?

Yes, please, Granddad Dog.

Catch this, captain.

Aye aye, skipper.

Granddad Dog is Grandpa Pig's very best friend.

Granny, did Polly tell you we needed help?

Yes, Polly is a very clever parrot.

Say I'm a clever parrot, woof woof!

I'm a clever parrot, woof woof!



Hello, Daddy Pig speaking.

Monsieur Pig, comment allez-vous?

Oh. Something is wrong with the phone.

Quelle temps fait il en Grande Bretagne? La pluie?

You see? The phone is talking nonsense.

Allo? Comment allez-vous?

Allo!

?

Oui. Au revoir!

That was Monsieur Donkey. He was speaking French.


Ha, I thought as much.

Mummy, what did Monsieur Donkey say?

He asked if little Delphine Donkey could visit us.

Oh goody.

Delphine Donkey is Peppa's very special friend from France.

Delphine's coming to practice talking English with us.

Hooray!

We'd better hurry. Delphine's train is arriving any minute.

Last stop, all change.

That's Delphine's train! Delphine!

Bonjour!

'Bonjour' means 'Hello' in French.

Bonjour.

Bonjour.

Bonjour Mr Donkey. My goodness, is that huge case for Delphine?

Yes, Delphine has brought a few little things for her visit. Things you do not have over here. Cheese, bread, tomatoes, water...

Au revoir, Delphine. I'll be back to pick you up tomorrow night.

Where should I put Delphine's luggage?

In my room, at the very top of the house.

Oh. And this luggage is for one night stay?

Oh yes, that is why I only pack a little bag.

Oh.

Now, Delphine is here to practice talking English, so we must all help her.

Yes, mummy.

First, I must say sorry, I do not speak English



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Fire Engine



very well.

You don't speak too badly.

You are very kind, Monsieur Pig. But may I ask you a question about talking English?

Of course, I am an expert at taking. Ask away.

Are English split infinitives a form of irregular verb, or past pronoun?

Uh...

Actually it's quite late. Shall we set up Delphine's bed?

Mummy, mummy, can Delphine sleep in my bed, with a pillow at each end?

Good idea, Peppa.

Peppa and Delphine are sleeping at each end of the same bed.

Now children, try to go to sleep.

You'll get a busy day tomorrow. Delphine is visiting your playgroup.

Wow.

Dormez bien.

Dormez bien is French for 'sleep well'

I'm not sleepy at all.

Let's sing a little song to make us sleepy.

Yes.

Delphine's pretty French song has sent everyone to sleep.

Delphine has come to Peppa's playgroup.

Madame Gazelle, this is my French friend  Delphine Donkey.

Bonjour.

Ah, bonjour Delphine.

Delphine sang a pretty French song last night. Can we teach her an English song?

How about "The Bing-bong Song"?


Yes, sing me this "Bing-bong song". It would be good for my English.

Ok. Wooo... We're playing a tune, and we're singing a song with a bing and a bong and a bing.

Bong bing boo! Bing bong bing! Bing bong bingly bungly boo!

Good, I have learnt lots of new English words.



Mummy Pig is dressed as a fireman.

Mummy, why are you dressed like that?

I'm going to the mummy's fire engine practice.

Wow!

This is just a good excuse for a cup of tea and a chat.

Well, what are you doing today, Daddy Pig?

I've got a very important meeting with the daddy's football team.

That's just a lot of grown-up boys kicking a football around.

We are having a barbecue as well.

Here are Mr Bull, Mr Rabbit, Mr Pony and Mr Zebra.

Moo, is Daddy Pig coming out to play?

Come on!

Mummy, can we see the fire engine?

Yes!

Oh, goodie!

This is Miss. Rabbit's fire station.

Miss. Rabbit: Hello, Peppa and George. Come and see the fire engine.

Fire engine!

Miss. Rabbit: There is a ladder for climbing, a hose for



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Fire Engine



squirting water, and a big bell to ring.

Dingdong dingdong!

Miss. Rabbit: Now, let's go up to the tower and look for fires.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Peppa! Hello, George.

Miss. Rabbit: Oh, who's for a nice cup of tea and a chat?

That sounds nice.

A telephone!

Miss. Rabbit: Peppa, that is the fire phone. It's only to be used when there is a fire.

Miss. Rabbit: Ah, fire! Fire! Fire station, where is the fire?

Where is the fire?

Can I speak to Mummy Pig, please?

Miss. Rabbit: Oh, it's Daddy Pig.

Daddy Pig, you are not supposed to ring on this phone. It's only for emergencies

This is an emergency. I can't find the tomato ketchup anywhere.

Daddy Pig, shall I light the barbecue now?

Yes, please, Mr Rabbit.

Do be careful with the barbecue, Daddy Pig.

Trust me, Mummy Pig. We daddies know all about barbecues. Bye!

Maybe it needs more charcoal.

Give it a bit of blow.

Put a few more fire lighters on.

Miss. Rabbit: Now, we just have to wait for a fire.

How long do we have to wait?

Miss. Rabbit: Oh, it could be a long time. I've been waiting ages.

How many fires have you actually put out, Miss Rabbit?


Miss. Rabbit: None, not one fire, but you've got to be ready.

It's the fire phone.

Miss. Rabbit: Can you answer it, Peppa? It'll probably be your daddy again.

Ok! Hello, fire station.

Hello, Peppa.

Oh, daddy, it is you! You're very naughty. This phone is for fires only.

Can you put Miss Rabbit on, please? That's a good girl!

Daddy wants to speak to you.

Miss. Rabbit: Hello, Daddy Pig. This phone is only to be used when there is a...

Fire! Fire!

Oh, dear, Daddy Pig's barbecue is on fire.

Fire! Fire!

Mummies to the rescue!

Miss. Rabbit: Whee...

Hold tight!

Whee...

Fire! Fire! Dingdong dingdong!

It's Miss Rabbit's fire engine.

Hurray!

Miss. Rabbit: Stand back, daddies.

Mummy dog, turn on the water.

Aye, aye, Mummy Pig!

The fire is out.

Hurray!

Thank you for saving us, Miss Rabbit.

Miss. Rabbit: No problem! It's all part of the service.

The mummy's fire engine service.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Princess Peppa



And now that Miss Rabbit has kindly flooded our garden. We can all jump up and down in muddy puddles.

Yes!

I love fire engines, especially when they made muddy puddles!



It is bed time for Peppa and George.

Good night, my little piggies!

Granny and Grandpa Pigs have come for dinner.

Hello!

Hello!

Where are Peppa and George?

They are asleep.

Oh, but I so want to see them, can I take a peek?

Ok, Granny Pig, but be very quiet.

Granny Pig!

Ganny Ig!

Hello, my little darlings! You should be asleep!

Tell us a story!

Ok, but only if you promise to go straight back to sleep.

Ok, I'll just sleep after the story.

All right. Once upon a time, there was...

A little boy called Pedro Pony, and he found some magic bean.

Oh! Yes. Now Pedra planted the bean and it grew into an enormous bean stalk that went high into the sky.

That's right!

Pedro climbed to the top of that bean sprout and found a...


A horrible big giant. But I don't want that. I want a princess!

Oh, yes! There he found a beautiful princess Peppa.

Haha.

And Sir George, the brave knight.

And a cook, who made the most delicious food ever.

Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and Grandpa Pig are waiting to eat dinner.

I'll go and see what's keeping Granny Pig.

What's next in the story?

Naughty Granny Pig! You woke the little ones.

We promised to sleep when the story ends, grandpa.

I'm good at ending stories, Granny Pig. And you go down stairs. I won't be long.

There's a boy, a bean stalk, a beautiful princess, a brave knight. and a cook who makes the lovely dinner.

Well, after they ate the lovely dinner, everyone fell asleep, the end.

Then they all woke up and along came a wizard.

A wizard?

Yes, a wizard who was going to do a big magic show.

Ah, but...

Then, along came a scary dragon.

Granny Pig, Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are still waiting to eat dinner.

That bit time story doesn't seem to be working.

I'm the expert in telling bedtime stories, I'll have them sleep in no time.

Ahhh, a scary dragon!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Teddy Playgroup



Peppa, Gorge, back to bed!

But grandpa hasn't finished the story yet, daddy.

I'll finish the story. I'll be done in a minute.

Ok, there is a boy, a bean stalk, a castle, a beautiful princess, a brave knight, a cook, a wizard and a scary dragon.

And a very hungry king. So they all had a big dinner and lived happily ever after. The end.

Then, they had a party! And all their friends came.

Right, I think I'd better sort this out.

Ho ho ho ho.

Daddy Pig!

They are almost asleep.

Thank you. I'll take over now.

You have to finish the story, mummy.

Ok, quickly now. Tell me what's happened.

Once upon the time, in olden days, a long time ago...

Mummy Pig has been up there for a long time.

I can hear snoring.

At last! Peppa and Gorge are asleep.

Then they all lived happily ever after. The end.

Peppa, George!

Sh  Mummy is asleep!

Ho ho ho ho, it looks like princess Peppa is the best to tell the bedtime stories.

That's right. I am!



It is home time at Peppa's playgroup.

Daddy, Teddy playgroup is coming to stay.

Wow.


Teddy playgroup is our school's mascot.

It's Peppa's turn to take him home.

Yeah, he has pajamas, a photo album and a toothbrush.

It's all in his suitcase.

I see.

Peppa, Daddy Pig and Teddy playgroup have arrived home.

Mummy Pig, we have a special guest staying with us tonight.

Really? Who is that?

Teddy Playgroup. He has pajamas, a photo album and a toothbrush.

What's the photo album for?

We take photos of him doing exciting things.

Oh...

My friends have taken Teddy Playgroup all over the world.

London, Paris, Egypt. Oh, I say, Teddy playgroup does have an exciting life.

I hope he was an exciting time with us.

It is Peppa and George's bed time.

Everybody, this is Teddy Playgroup. Hello, he is a special guest. You all have to make room. Oh, and that is Mr Dinosaur. He looks very good at talking.

Let's take a photo for Teddy Playgroup's album.

Say "cheese".

Cheese. Daddy, Teddy Playgroup needs to have an exciting time tomorrow. Can we go to the North Pole?

Err... How about the supermarket?

Yes, I don't think Teddy Playgroup has ever been shopping before.

It is morning. Peppa is taking Teddy Playgroup to the supermarket.

This shop sells everything, oranges, apples,




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Danny's Pirate Party



bananas. Very interesting.

This is the checkout where all the food is paid for.

George wants to take a picture.

Ok, George.

Cheese.

Cheese.

Haha. That's enough pictures, George.

Oh, where is Teddy Playgroup?

Teddy Playgroup is missing.

Daddy, you've lost Teddy Playgroup.

Don't worry, Peppa. I'm sure I'll find him.

Hello. How was your day?

Daddy lost Teddy Playgroup.

Oh, no.

But I've got a plan to find him.

How are we going to find Teddy Playgroup, Daddy?

First, we print out all the photos we took of him.

Mummy Pig is unpacking the shopping.

Where are you going?

We are going to stick pictures of Teddy Playgroup on trees.

Oh...

Daddy, wait for me. Why are we sticking photos on trees, Daddy?

When people see the pictures of Teddy Playgroup, they'll know he is lost, and they can help us find him.

Oh, this is Teddy in my bed. This is Teddy in the kitchen. And these are George's pictures at the supermarket. Ar, Teddy Playgroup! I know where he is.

Oh, hello?

Mummy, we know where Teddy Playgroup is!



Yes, he is in the shopping bag with the pasta and tomatoes.

Peppa is showing her class Teddy Playgroup's photo album.

I was worried that Teddy Playgroup wasn't having an exciting adventure with us. Then luckily, my daddy lost him at the supermarket.

But we found him again in the shopping.

That was an exciting adventure!

Yes, it was.



Today is Danny Dog's Birthday. He is having a party.

Yo ho ho!

Everyone has come dressed as a pirate.

Pedro Pony is dressed up as a cowboy.

Yee hi!

Ahoy, there, we hearties.

It is Granddad Dog dressed up as a pirate.

Hello, Granddad Dog.

Call me Dog Beard.

Hello, Dog Beard.

Which of ye scurvy pirates crave a ration of swashbuckling o'er the briny seas?

Why is he talking funny?

That's pirate talk.

If you want to play my pirate game, say "Argh"!

Argh!

Is it a dangerous game?

No, Pedro. Granddad Dog has promised me. It will be a very safe game.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Danny's Pirate Party



But it will be exciting. So who wants to play?

Argh!

Here be the plan. Time was, I had a heap of gold that was mine by right. But I was hornswoggled by one Cap'n Hog.

What?

Pirate talk is a bit difficult to understand.

Captain Hog took my treasure.

Oh!

Oh you. The Captain Hog is a fearsome pirate. Some of you may have already known him as Grandpa Pig.

Ah, Grandpa Pig!

The game is to go to Captain Pig's hideout and get back my treasure without being caught.

Hurrah!

Everyone is excited to be playing a pirate game.

Hello, Grandpa Pig. We are on our way.

Jolly good.

Jolly good.

Grandpa Pig and Polly Parrot are gardening the pirate treasure.

Be the black galleon fast and the wind at our backs, we'll away!

What does that mean?

Run to the boat.

Yo ho ho.

Hold there. Put your life jackets up.

On Granddad Dog's boat, all the children must wear life jackets.

That scurvy Dog Beard should be here by now.

Here is a nice cup of tea, Grandpa Pig.


Oh, thank you. Granny Pig.

At last, are we already now?

Mr Dog Beard, I need to go to the toilet.

And me.

What can be keeping them? Hello, Granddad Dog. I thought you said you were on your way.

Yes, yes. We are almost there. It's taking a while to get my crew together.

Anchor's away. Full sail.

Aye aye, Dog Beard.

Oh jolly pirates we, that sail the deep blue sea, to find a golden treasure, for sails are high yippee.

Land ahoy!

The children have arrived at Grandpa Pig's orchard.

The game is to get that treasure without being caught.

Hurrah for the pirates!

Shush! Mummy.

I hope there are no pirates around here, trying to take my lovely treasure.

Peppa and her friends have got the coins without being caught.

It's chocolate coins.

Everybody loves chocolate coins.

Yum, yum, yum.

Aha, got you.

Granddad Dog has been caught.

Try and take my treasure, would you?

'Tis mine! I won it fair and square!

No, no. You didn't.

Oh, yes, I did.

Thank you, Captain Hog and Dog Beard for the




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mr Potato Comes to Town



lovely pirate game.

Oh, you are very welcome.

Eh, oh yes. It's been lots of fun.

Happy birthday, Danny!

It's been the best pirate party ever!

Argh!



Peppa and her family are watching Mr Potato on television.

I love watching programs about keeping fit.

Now, here are some lovely drawings I've been sent. This is an apple. Remember, eating fruit and vegetables helps you stay fit.

I'm good at eating fruit and vegetables.

And exercise is important. Today you can see me open a new sports centre in town.

Mummy, can we go and see Mr Potato?

It's a long way to go to see a potato, Peppa.

It's not any old potato.

This is Mr Potato. Can we go and see him, mummy? Please!

All right.

Hurray!

Everyone has come to see Mr Potato open a new sports centre.

Look, it's Mr Potato!

Mr Potato!

Oh, it's just Peppa.

Oh...

Hello everyone!

Hello Peppa.

Suzy thought you were Mr Potato.



I don't look like Mr Potato.

No, you're much too big.

Mr Potato is bigger than me.

No, he is not. He is a potato.

And potatoes are this big.

Here is Mr Potato!

Mr Potato has come to town.

Please welcome your friend and mine, Mr Potato!

Hurray!

Wow, that's a big potato.

I declare this sports centre open!

Fantastic! We must all exercise and eat fruit and vegetables.

Which one should we eat, Mr Potato?

Apples, oranges, carrots, tomatoes...

Potatoes!

Umm...

Why aren't you small, like a normal potato?

Umm...

Because he is not a normal potato. He's got legs.

Normal potatoes don't have legs.

He's a super potato!

We watch your show every morning.

Very good! And remember to send me your drawings.

We will!

Peppa and her friends are at the playgroup.

Children, today we will do drawings for Mr Potato.

Hurray!

I'm drawing a pineapple.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Train Ride



I'm drawing a carrot.

Very good. What are you drawing, Emily?

A pea!

Lovely! And Pedro?

It's a super potato.

Oh I see. And George has drawn a wonderful tomato.

Peppa, what vegetable have you drawn?

My daddy, watching television.

Oh, excellent. Now, we put the drawings in an envelope and post them to Mr Potato.

It is morning and time for the Mr Potato show.

Please welcome your friend and mine, Mr Potato!

We posted some drawings to Mr Potato in an envelope.

Did you get the envelope?

He can't hear you, daddy. He is on television.

Oh, yes. Of course.

I've received an envelope full of drawings. This tomato looks very juicy.

That's George's picture.

Well done, Geroge.

But this picture from Peppa pig is my favorite.

Wow, that's my picture!

It shows Daddy Pig watching TV. Mmm, looks like Daddy Pig needs some exercise.

What?

Come on, Daddy Pig. Let's do some jumping up and down!

Oh, all right.

Up, down, up, down...


Daddy Pig likes jumping up and down. Everyone likes jumping up and down.

Up and down, up and down, all together now. Mr Potato is rolling around. Your friends are mine. He's happy all the time. Mr Potato is coming to town.


Today, Peppa and her friends are going on a train ride. Mr Rabbit is the station master.

How many tickets?

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Ten child tickets and one teacher tickets, please.

Now, children, do not lose these tickets.

Can I see your tickets, please?

I've lost my tickets.

Oh dear, Pedro, you must be more careful.

There is your ticket.

Try not to lose it again.

Here comes the train.

Miss Rabbit is the train driver.

All aboard.

Hooray!

Clickity clack, clickity clack, the train is on the track.

Huff and puff, huff and puff, clickity clickity clack.

Aho. Here are your activity sheets

The children have to spot everything that is on the activity sheet.

A boat.

A signal box.

And a tunnel.

I can see trees.

Are trees on the list?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Granny Pig's Chickens



Ah, no.

I can see clouds.

Are clouds on the list?

No.

I can see Granddad Dog.

Ahoy, there.

Hello, Granddad Dog.

Is Granddad Dog on the list?

Silly Peppa, my granddad won't be on the list.

But he is sailing a boat.

And a boat is on the list.

Hooray!

The children tick the boat on their activity sheets.

Tickets, please.

Mr Rabbit has come to check everyone's ticket.

I think I've lost my ticket.

Oh dear, oh dear.

Meow, there's your ticket. Pedro, you are sitting on it.

Now you try not to lose it again, Pedro.

The train is going slowly uphill. The train is going quickly downhill.

Madam Gazelle. I feel a bit sick. Can I go to the front, please?

Ok, Pedro, you can go to the front of the train.

Hello, Pedro, not feeling very well? Would you like to drive the train for a bit?"

Yes, please.

Clickity clack, clickity clack, the train goes on the track. Huff and puff, huff and puff, the train goes on the track.


A signal box,

That's on our list,

Hooray!

The children tick the signal box on their activity sheets.

The signal has stopped the train so that someone important could cross.

It's Mrs Duck and her friends.

Oh, we still haven't seen the tunnel.

It's going dark

We're in a tunnel.

The tunnel is the last thing on the activity sheet.

Hooray!

Last stop.

All change, everybody off now.

But Madam Gazelle, how are we going to get home?

Peppa, we're back where we started.

The train has gone in a big circle.

Tickets, please.

Pedro's lost his ticket again.

Pedro, can I have my hat back, please?

There's Pedro's ticket.

Oh, that's where I put it.



Peppa and George are having a sleepover at Granny and Grandpa's house.

Granny Pig!

Ganny Ig!

Hello, my little ones!

Bye bye. See you later.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Granny Pig's Chickens



Bye bye, mummy.

Come and see where you are going to sleep tonight.

This was Mummy Pig's room when she was a little piggy.

In the old times!

And this is the bed mummy slept on.

Oh, bouncy bed.

You are just like your mummy when she was little.

Did mummy bounce on the bed?

Of course!

But mummy tells us not to bounce on the beds.

When mummy was a little piggy, she was cheeky just like you.

Was she?

Yes! Now let's go and see Grandpa Pig in the garden.

Grandpa Pig!

Papa Ig!

Hello Peppa, Hello George. Come and see my carrots.

Grandpa Pig is very proud of his vegetables.

Wow.

And here are my peas.

Ohhh.

But best of all are my lettuces. Oh, No! My lettuces!

I think the birds have eaten them, grandpa

Yes, birds!

Why didn't Mr Scarecrow scare them away?

Because the birds that ate my lettuces are very stupid!


What's the matter, Grandpa Pig?

Your friends have been eating my vegetables again!

Which friends?

Tom, Dick, and Henry!

Those aren't their names.

Granny Pig has chickens.

Wow.

Say hello to Jemima, Sarah and Vanessa

Hello.

And here is Neville.

Is Neville a boy chicken?

Yes, Peppa. He is a cockerel.

He is the worst, scratching up my vegetables!

Neville would't have to fly!

I've seen him eat flies!

Yuk!

And he ate my lettuces!

You don't want to eat grandpa's lettuce, do you?

Now there is pleasant lovely corn to eat! Come on! This way home.

Peppa, George, would you like to feed corn to the chickens?

Yes, please, granny.

Here you are, chickens. Eat up. Wow. You've got a windy house.

That's the chicken cook. It's where the chickens lay their eggs.

Eggs? I can't see any eggs?

Not now, but there will be eggs soon.

Woooo.

It is bed time for Peppa and George at granny



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Talent Day



and grandpa's house.

Have that chickens laid their eggs yet, granny?

Maybe in the morning, Peppa.

How will we know when it's morning?

Neville will tell us. Now go to sleep.

Night night!

It is morning!

It's Neville!

Thank you for waking us up, Neville.

Good morning, Jemima, Sarah, and Vanessa. Do you have any eggs for us?

One, two, three, four. Four eggs, granny.

Now we will have eggs for breakfast

Thank you, Jemima, Sarah, and Vanessa.

Boiled eggs for everyone

Hurray!

Mmm, delicious. Granny. Your chickens make yummy eggs.

Yes! It's all that the lovely corn they eat.

And my lettuces.



It's the end of another day at Peppa's playgroup.

Children, tomorrow is Talent Day.

What is a talent?

A talent is something you like doing and you are good at.

I like to watch television and I am good at it.

Think of something we might like to see you do. My talent is playing the guitar.

The parents have arrived to pick up the children.

Don't forget to think of something to do


for Talent Day tomorrow.

It is bedtime for Peppa and George.

I can't go to bed yet. I haven't got a talent to show tomorrow.

But you have lots of talents, Peppa.

Yes, I can skip. I can sing. Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

I can dance.

It's hard to choose one talent. I am good at lots of things.

Don't worry, you can decide tomorrow.

Ok.

It is Talent Day.

My talents are skipping, singing and dancing. I practiced them all last night.

I was practicing watching television last night.

That's not a talent. Madame Gazelle said so.

What can I do then?

Who would like to show us their talent first? Danny Dog.

I can bang a drum. I can bang it louder.

No, that was lovely, Danny. Pedro Pony, what's your talent?

Magic Tricks. Here's a glass of water. It is wet and see-through.

Now I will make the water disappear. Please close your eyes.

Open your eyes.

The water has gone.

Thank you.

Emily Elephant.

I am going to play the recorder.

And what is your talent, Rebecca?

I can make a special noise. It only works if I go up on my tiptoes.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. A Trip to the Moon



That was the hiccup...

Yes, but what can I do?

Candy, what is your talent?

Skipping.

I was going to do skipping. But I can still do dancing and singing.

My talent is singing. Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

I can still do dancing.

Suzy Sheep, what is your talent?

Dancing.

No. you can't dance...

Oh, dear, dancing was Peppa's last talent.

It is so nice that everyone has chosen a different talent to perform. Now, what do we have left, Peppa?

I was going to skip, or sing, or dance! But they have all been done.

A talent can be anything, Peppa.

But not watching television.

Think of something you really like to do.

I know! I've got a talent that's I'm really good at.

I wonder what Peppa's talent could be.

My special talent, that's the best dance in the whole world, is jumping up and down in muddy puddle!

Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles. Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.


It is a lovely sunny day. Peppa is playing with her fancy ball. George and his friend Edmond Elephant are playing with their space toys.

Moon, moon

George is pretending the bouncy ball is the


moon.

I was playing with that ball. Ooh...

Edmond's space toy has landed on Peppa's head.

This looks fun. Are you going to the moon?

It is just boring space stuff for baby study. It's not real.

But space is real, Peppa. And there are real rockets that go to the moon.

The museum has a show all about the moon.

Shall we go and see it?

Yeah!

Will we really have to go to the moon?

No, Peppa, we are not going to the moon.

We are going to the museum.

Ok.

Here is the museum.

Hello, everyone. Have you come to see the moon show?

Yes, Miss Rabbit, five tickets, please.

There you are. Enjoy your trip to the moon.

Ooh, we really are going to the moon.

No, Peppa, it's just pretend.

This way for our trip to the moon.

Mr Rabbit is the tour guide.

Prepare, take off.

It is just pretend, isn't it?

That's right, Peppa. It's just pretend.

Five, four, three, two, one, blast off!

We live on a planet. Does anyone know what it is called?

The Earth

That's right.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grandpa at the Playground



I am a bit of expert at the space things.

There're seven other planets that go around our sun. Does anyone know what they are call?

Mercury...

Oh, well done, Edmond.

Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus.

Edmond knows all about the space.

I'm a clever clogs.

Does anyone know what these planets are made of?

They are made of cardboard.

These models are made of cardboard. But the real planets are made of rock and ice and gas.

But of course the moon is made of cheese.

No, the moon is made of rock. And this is a serious tour, so no jokes and no giggling.

Here we are, on the moon.

It's a pretend moon, really, isn't?

Yes, if this was the real moon, you could jump over my head.

Does anyone know why we can jump so high on the moon?

Gravity.

Oh, that's right, Edmond. Gravity is what keeps us on the ground. It is weaker on the moon, so you can jump higher.

We can make you feel like you are jumping on the moon with a help of science.

That sounds impressive. How do you do that?

With big rubber bands.

Everyone is scrapping into Mr.Rabbit's anti-gravity rubber bands.

Bouncing on the pretend moon is fun.

Say moon cheese


Moon cheese

And that's the end of the tour. Please walk this way.

Are there trees on the moon?

No

Are there any castles on the moon?

No

Are there any moon shops?

No. That would be silly.

Welcome to the moon shop. We've got moon maps, moon books and we've even got a picture of piggies on the moon with an elephant.

Look there we are, jumping on the moon.

We've got moon rock, too. It's got a picture of the moon all the way through the middle.

Woo...

How about some real moon cheese?

How much is it, Miss Rabbit?

Five pounds, please.

Five pounds?

It's all for a good cause.

I like the moon now because it's very interesting.

Mmm, and very tasty.



Grandpa Pig is looking after Peppa and George today.

Now grandpa I will tell you how everything works. This is the slide. You climb up here and you slide down there. And everyone takes it in turns.

Ho, ho! I know what a slide is, Peppa. I used to play on one myself when I was a little piggy.

Did you have swings, too in the olden days?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grandpa at the Playground



Ho, ho! We had swings and climbing frames and roundabouts.

Oh.

But my favorite was the slide.

It's my favorite, too.

Everyone takes it in turns to have a go on the slide.

Naughty Richard, you know you have to wait your turn.

Richard Rabbit finds it's hard to wait his turn.

Oh dear, it's not easy being small, is it, Richard?

Because Richard is little, I don't think you should have to wait.

I wouldn't change the rules if I were you, Grandpa Pig.

Nonsense, the children understand, don't you?

Ha ha!

But Grandpa, George is little and he has to wait his turn.

Yes, George is little, so he shouldn't have to wait neither.

Oh dear, Richard and George are taking all the turns on the slide.

Grandpa, when do we get go on the slide?

Don't worry, Peppa. They won't be on it for long.

I am bored of waiting.

Me too! Let's play on the swing.

Here is Pedro Pony on the swing.

Pedro, can I have a go now?

I just want to swing a bit more.

But you have on the swing for ages.


Grandpa Pig, could you push me a little bit please?

I think it is someone else's turn now, Pedro.

But I have to go home soon.

Oh, I see! That's different. Let me push you then.

But, grandpa...

I'm bored of waiting.

Me too!

And me!

Let's play on the roundabout.

Everyone wants to get on the roundabout.

Too many children on the roundabout. Everybody off!

But Grandpa Pig, I was actually here first.

Ah! Then you can get back on the roundabout.

I need to get on too.

Why is that? Rebecca.

Because it's my birthday soon.

Oh! Ok!

And me.

All right, is everybody ready?

Yes.

Stop, there are no boys on the roundabout.

Now is everybody ready?

I'm wearing glasses. Can I go on please?

The children themselves are making up their own rules.

I need to get on, because I like carrots.

Now, are you all ready to go?

No, I have to get on because I can do this.

Here is Mummy Pig.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Goldie the Fish



How are you getting on Grandpa Pig?

I... I'm confused. These playground rules are too complicated.

There is only one rule, Grandpa Pig, and that is, everyone waits their turn.

What? Even the little ones?

Even the little ones.

What's about the very old ones like grandpa?

Even the very old ones like grandpa.

At the playground everyone has their turn.

Wee!



It is a lovely sunny morning. Daddy Pig is driving to work in his car.

Breakfast time, Goldie.

Mummy Pig is feeding Goldie the Fish.

Mummy, Goldie isn't eating.

Oh, maybe she's not feeling very well. Let's phone Doctor Hamster the vet.

Doctor Hamster the vet speaking.

Hello, Doctor Hamster. Goldie the Fish is not eating.

And she looks sad.

Oh, you better bring Goldie to see me right way.

Oh, Daddy took the car. How do we get to the vet?

We can take the bus.

Oh, goody!

This is the bus stop.

The timetable says the next bus will be here at  o'clock.

What time is it now?


o'clock.

Hurray!

How many tickets?

One Mummy ticket and two little piggies.

And one fish please.

The fish goes free. Hold tight!

Mr Bull is waiting for the bus.

Moo... One ticket to the music shop please.

Hello, Mr Bull. We are taking Goldie to the vet.

Oh, dear! Feeling poorly, are we, Goldie?

She can't talk. She is a fish.

Of course. Eh... Maybe she'd like to hear a tune on my tuba.

It sounds funny.

That's why I'm going to the music shop to get it mended.

Woo!

Mrs Sheep, Mrs Cat, Mr Zebra and Madame Gazelle have got on the bus.

Four tickets to the supermarket, please.

Hello, Madame Gazelle. We're taking Goldie to the vet's.

Oh, is Goldie not well?

She likes you!

The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus go round and round, all day long!

Supermarket!

Bye!

Music shop!

Bye!

Last stop, the vet!

The vet helps sick pets get better.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Funfair



Ah, is this the sad little fish that won't eat?

Yes, watch this!

Goldie is eating the food.

Oh, she didn't eat at home.

Maybe Goldie was bored at home. The interesting journey has cheered her up.

Oh.

You have a very healthy, happy fish. She's lovely.

Thank you, Doctor Hamster.

Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are going home on the bus.

Mr Bull is going home with his mended tuba.

It is just as good as new!

Hehe...

Madame Gazelle and her friends are going home with their shopping.

I see Goldie the Fish is happy again.

Yes, it was the bus ride that made her better.

The fish in the bowl swims round and round, round and round, round and round.

The fish in the bowl swims round and round, all day long!

Haha...

Hello, where have you been?

We took Goldie to the vet. And now she is better.

Oh dear, Goldie has a cough.

I think we should take Goldie to the vet again tomorrow.

I can drive you in the car.

No, Daddy. We want to go on the bus. It's fun!

Okay, we will go on the bus.


Hurray!

Everyone loves going on the bus, especially Goldie the Fish.

The fish in the bowl swims round and round, round and round, round and round. The fish in the bowl swims round and round, all day long!


Today, Peppa and her family have come to the funfair.

I love the funfair.

Sliding, sliding.

George wants to go to the helter-skelter.

Ok. See you later.

See you later.

Roll up, roll up. Hook a duck and win a giant teddy.

Mummy, can we have a go?

Ok.

One pound, please.

One pound?

It's all for a good cause.

Win a giant teddy, mummy!

I'll try, Peppa, but I don't think it's that easy.

You are right. You've got no chance.

What?

It's impossible. Waste of money, if you ask me.

We'll see about that.

Mummy Pig has won.

Hurray!

That's amazing. Here's your giant teddy.

Would you like a little teddy instead, Peppa?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Funfair



No way, Jose!

Look, mummy. A giant teddy!

It's a bit big.

No, it's not.

George and daddy are queuing for the helter-selter.

Mmm... it's a bit high, George. Are you sure you want to have a go?

One pound, please.

One pound?

It's all for a good cause.

Oh dear. It is a bit too high for George.

Don't worry George. I will come up with you.

That's one pound, please.

Oh.

George isn't afraid of height any more.

Oh, it is a bit high, isn't it? I'll just go down the stairs.

The stairs are full of children.

That's the way down, Daddy Pig.

Oh, ok.

Roll up, roll up. Hit the target and win a giant teddy.

You can do that easy, mummy.

We do not want to win another giant teddy, Peppa.

Sound worry. You won't win. Women are useless at this.

I'm sorry. What did you say?

It's a game of skill.

How much for one go?

One pound.

Mummy Pig has won.


Unbelievable, here is your giant teddy.

Hurray!

I want a teddy like that one, mummy.

They are too big.

No, they are not.

Daddy Pig and George are riding on the big wheel.

Hold tight now.

That really is high. Oh, I'm glad that's over.

Five times' round for one pound.

Five times' round? Oh, no.

Roll up, roll up. Test your strength on the old hammer and bell.

What do we have to do?

You hit this button with this hammer. If the bell rings, you win a prize. No skill involved, but you need to be strong.

I'll have a go.

One pound. Bad luck!

Ho ho, I'm strong. I'll have a go.

Stand back, everyone.

Do be careful, Daddy Pig. You are no that fit.

Yes, Daddy Pig is dropping a bit tummy.

What?

I'm just saying Daddy Pig is a bit round in the tummy.

Give me that hammer.

Goodness me. I've never seen anything like it.

That wins all the giant teddies we have.

Hooray! Mummy, can we give these teddies to my friends?

What a good idea!

Thank you, Peppa.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Numbers



Most kind.

Thank you very much.



It is a school day for Peppa and her friends.

Hello, children. Today you will be learning all about numbers. Does anybody know what numbers are for?

Are numbers for counting?

Yes, Peppa! Who would like to do some counting now?

Me! Me! Me! Me!

Ok. Pedro.

One, two, three, four!

Pedro has counted to four.

Well done, Pedro! Can anyone count higher than four?

Me, Me, Me!

Rebecca.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

Rebecca has counted to seven.

Excellent, Rebecca!

Madame Gazelle?

Yes, Candy.

My mum can count to ten.Wow!

Yes? After seven, there is eight, nine, ten.

Eight, nine, ten.

Very good!

It is play time. Rebecca Rabbit, Zoe Zebra, Suzy Sheep and Peppa all like to skip.

I like sand I like sea. I like Suzy to skip with me.

I like ping. I like pong. I like Zoe to skip along.


I know. Let's see who can skip the most without stopping.

Squeak. I'll count. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Zoe wins. Hurray!

Hurray.

Hurray.

Pedro, do you want to do some skipping?

No thanks, Peppa. I'm hula-hooping. Wibble wobble, wibble wobble, wiggle waggle wee! Hula-hoop, hula-hoop, one, two, three!

How many can you do without stopping?

A million and three!

Wow! That's a lot.

Let's count them!

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

That was eight.

I'm a bit tired. I'll do the rest later.

Can you do hula-hoops, Emily?

I can do in my own special way!

Emily Elephant is hula-hooping with her trunk!

Great!

I think that was about one hundred.

George wants to play leap-frog.

George likes playing leap-frog.

Leap-frog, everybody!

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

Play time is over.

Madame Gazelle! We can all count to ten now.

Very good.

But we need to be playing to do it.

Of course. Richard, Edmond, bring the extra long skipping rope.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Digging up the Road

Oh, ok.

Is everybody ready?

Ready!

Counting to ten!

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

Yes, Daddy Pig.

Then let's go!

We are going to the playground. We are going to the playground.

Vroom... Vroom...

George and Peppa love going to the playground.

Oh, why have we stopped?

It's a traffic jam.

But we need to get to the playground.

Don't worry, George. The traffic is moving


again.

Stop!

Mr Bull has stopped the traffic.

What's the problem, Mr Bull?

Moo... We are digging up the road.

There's water coming out of the ground!

Yes. That's what we are here to fix.

Is it going to take long?

It will take as long as it takes.

Digger. Digger.

George likes diggers.

This Way, Mr Rhino.

Ok, boss.

Mr Bull is the boss.

Mr Bull, where's all that water coming from?

It's coming from a broken water pipe underground.

How are you going to fix it?

We dig up the road!

Wow!

We turn the water off.

George loves cranes.

Crane. Crane.

We take the old pipe out and put the new one in.

Thank you for showing us your work, Mr Bull.

Moo.... No problem. Bye. See you later!

Oh, dear. Geroge doesn't want to leave Mr Bull.

We are going to the playground, Geroge.

You can play diggers and cranes in the sand pit.

And you will see Mr Bull again on our way home.

Peppa and her family have arrived at the playground.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Peppa!

Edmond elephant and Richard Rabbit are playing in the sand pit.

Let's play in the sand pit.

Ok.

Stop.

What's the problem?

We are digging up the road and I am the boss.

Oh.

Is it going to take long?

It'll take as long as it'll take. We have to make a hole. We fill it in and the road is mended.

Hooray!

Peppa, George. It's time to go home.

Ah

Oh, dear. George doesn't want to go home yet.

On the way home, George, we can see Mr Bull digging up the road.

Bye, everyone.

Bye, Peppa.

Peppa and George are looking forward to seeing Mr Bull again.

Digger. Crane. Vroom.

Here we are.

Oh, Mr Bull is not here.

Mr Bull must have finished and gone home.

Digger. Crane. Vroom.

Moo.... Stop!

Oh, is the water pipe broken again?


No, Peppa. This time it's faulty electrical cables.

How to mend electrical cables?

We dig up the road!

Hooray!

Peppa and George love it when Mr.Bull digs up the road. Everyone loves it when Mr Bull digs up the road.




	 Peppa Pig Season 
































	 

Peppa Pig Season 









Peppa and her friends are playing at Rebecca Rabbit's house.

Let's play hide and seek.

We'll all hide and Peppa can find us.

Ok, one, two...

Everyone must find a hiding place before Peppa counts to ten. Danny and Candy are hiding in the branches of a little tree. Zoe, Pedro and Rebecca are hiding behind a fence. Suzy and Emily are hiding behind the bush.

Nine, ten! Ready or not, here I come!

I know where you are! Oh!

Peppa cannot find anyone.

This is impossible!

Freddy Fox has come to play.

Hello, Freddy!

Hello, Peppa! What are you doing?

We are playing hide and seek. But I cannot find anyone.

Should I find them for you?

You can try but it's impossible.

Watch this! Found you!

Oh! Hello Freddy.

Aha, there you are!

Oh!

Boo!

Oh!

Freddy Fox has found everyone.

How did you do that?


I am good at smelling.

What's smelling got to do with it?

I can find you by sniffing your smells.

I am not smelly. I had a bath last night.

I know. You smell nice.

Oh.

I could even find you with my eyes closed.

Go on then. Find Suzy with your eyes closed.

Easy!

Hide, Suzy!

One, two...

Suzy is looking for somewhere to hide.

Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

Ready or not, here I come.

Freddy is looking for Suzy with his eyes closed. He is sniffing where Suzy has walked. Round the tree, behind the little bush and back up the hill.

Found you!

Oh!

All thanks to my nose.

It is a super-nose.

Yes, it is!

Has everything got a smell?

Oh yes, everything has a different smell.

What do I smell of?

You smell of flowers on Wellington boots.

Ha ha ha!

What do I smell of?

You smell of wet grass and biscuits.

What do I smell of?

Bananas and jam.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Whistling



What do I smell of?

Milk and fish fingers.

What do I smell of?

Pedro, you smell of toothpaste.

What is your favorite smell?

Eggs.

What is the worst thing you have ever smelt?

Blue cheese.

Pooh wew.

It is nearly dinner time.

How do you know?

I can smell carrot soup.

I can smell carrot soup, too.

And me!

Dinner is ready. Come and get your carrot soup.

Everyone is enjoying Mummy Rabbit's carrot soup.

This soup is yummy.

Who can that be?

Mr Fox is coming to take Freddy home.

Um. Oh, I can smell dinner.

Oh, Mr Fox, hello!

Hello, Mummy Rabbit.

Hello, dad, I've just had my dinner down a rabbit hole.

Good lad.

And can you guess for what's for pudding?

Smells nice.

I'd say strawberry jelly.

That's right.

Mr Fox loves smelling things. Everyone loves


smelling things.



It is a lovely sunny morning. And Daddy Pig is reading his news paper.

Daddy what are you doing?

I'm reading the newspaper.

You are making a funny sound.

I'm whistling! Uh! Whistling is fun. You should try it!

I don't know how to.

It's easy! Just put your lips together and blow!

Try making a smaller "o" shape.

Like this! And then you could whistle a tune.

Oh, I've got the wrong kind of mouth.

Your mouth is fine! You just need to practice.

It's impossible!

It takes time to learn how to do important things like riding a bicycle or playing the piano. It took me years to learn how to wiggle my ears.

Wow!

Mummy Pig is in the kitchen making cookies.

What are you doing, Peppa?

I'm learning to whistle.

Oh, I see.

Mummy, can you whistle?

I don't know. I've never tried.

It takes a lot of practice.

Oh, yes!

Mummy Pig can whistle.

You can whistle because you are old, mummy.

Thank you, Peppa.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Doctor Hamster's Tortoise



George is in the bedroom, playing with his toy rocket.

George, I'm learning to whistle. You make an "o" shape with your mouth and blow.

Don't worry George. It's almost impossible like wiggling your ears.

George can wiggle his ears.

Whistling is harder.

George can whistle!

What's wrong, Peppa?

I can't whistle but everybody else can.

Never mind. I'm making cookies. Would you like to lip a spoon?

No. Thank you. Mummy. Can I ring Suzy Sheep instead?

Ok Peppa

Hello Mrs Pig.

Hello Mrs Sheep. Can Peppa talk to Suzy please?

Hello Suzy.

Hello Peppa. What're you doing?

I'm learning to whistle but I can't do it yet.

That sounds hard!

It's impossible. Uh... Can you whistle Suzy?

No.

Oh good! I mean that's so difficult whistle. But good, because I can't whistle.

What's whistling anyway?

You put your lips together and blow.

Like this? Hello? Peppa?

Good cookies are ready!

Oh! Goody! Cookies!

They will be hot! You should blow on them


first.

Do you not want a cookie, Peppa?

No, thank you mummy. I think I might go outside and be on my own for a little bit.

Can you whistle yet?

It's no use daddy. I'm never going to whistle. Ever!

Have you been practicing?

Yes, lots. But it doesn't work!

You need a little rest, Peppa. Here, have a cookie. It's hot. You should blow.

Oh! What's that?

It sounded like a whistle to me!

What a lovely tune!

Peppa has learned how to whistle!

I can whistle!



It is a school day.

Children, Doctor Hamster has come to talk to us today.

Hello everyone!

Hello Doctor Hamster!

Doctor Hamster is a vet.

Who knows what a vet does?

That helps sick pets get better.

That's right. And I brought some of my pets to show you.

Woo.

This is Binky, the budgie.

Hello Binky.

Woof! Can I stroke Binky?

Yes, very gently.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Doctor Hamster's Tortoise



He feels fluffy.

Oh, there is feathers. They help him to fly.

Flying is helping Binky get his exercise.

Can you tell me what else Binky needs to stay fit and healthy?

He needs to eat.

Yes.

He needs to drink.

That's right.

He needs to breathe a bit.

Very good.

He needs to sleep.

Excellent.

Woo. Sorry, Madame Gazelle, I overslept.

Oh, Pedro, you do like sleeping.

Yes, Madame Gazelle.

I have got a pet here who loves sleeping.

It's a tortoise.

It's Tiddles, the tortoise.

Hello Tiddles!

Tiddles has slept all through the winter.

Woo.

Why has he got that shell thing on his back?

That shell is his house. It's where he hides if he gets scared. Would you like to stroke him?

Yes, please. Don't be scared, Tiddles.

How old is he?

Tiddles is .

That's as old as my mum.

But tortoises can live for a hundred years.

That's as old as my grandpa.



Why is he so slow?

He has to carry his house on his back.

Ah, Doctor Hamster, I think Tiddles is escaping.

He can't go far.

Because he is so slow.

I have got someone else to show you here.

Dinosaur!

Oh! George! You always say dinosaur!

Oh! It is a dinosaur!

Woo.

She is not a dinosaur, this is Lulu, the lizard.

Hello Lulu!

She is scaly, like a dragon.

Can she breathe fire?

No, but she has a very long tongue.

Wow.

Does she sleep through the winter, like Tiddles?

No. Oh! Where is Tiddles? Tiddles!

Oh, dear! Tiddles the tortoise has run away!

Don't worry Doctor Hamster, we'll find where it is.

Is he in the music room?

Tiddles is not in the music room.

Is he in the play house?

Tiddles is not in the play house.

Is he hiding by the coats?

Tiddles is not hiding by the coats.

I can smell Tiddles. This way.

Freddy Fox has a very good sense of smell.

There is Tiddles!


	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Sun, Sea and Snow



Tiddles is up a tree!

Oh, I'd better call for help!

This is Miss Rabbit's fire station.

Ah! Fire, fire! Fire station, where is the fire?

My Tiddles is up a tree.

What? Again? Emergency, emergency!

Tortoise's up a tree!

I don't know why you like climbing tree so much? You're a tortoise!

Stand back!

Tiddles, come on Tiddles.

Hurray!

Thank you, Miss Rabbit!

Just doing my job.

And my job is looking after pets.

Where are Binky and Lulu?

Oh, I don't know!

Ah hoo, here they are, safe and sound.



It is bed time for Peppa and George.

Tomorrow we're going on a coach trip to the seaside.

We can make sand castles!

I fancy a swim.

Me, too! The weather forecast says it's going to be sunny.

Good night, Peppa! Good night, George!

Oh! It is starting to snow.

It is morning.

Yipee! It's sunny! Oh! Snow!

A lot of snow has fallen in the night.


Snow, mummy! Snow, daddy! Snow, snow, snow!

Hey, What?

We're still going to the seaside, don't we?

Well, let's see how much snow there is.

Oh, where's daddy gone? Oh, it's a walking snowman.

I'm cold.

It's a walking talking snowman.

Oh, it's just daddy.

Poor daddy! Let's warm you up a bit!

Ha ha ha.

Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are warming Daddy Pig up by rubbing him with towels.

That's better.

Now we can go to the seaside.

But what about the snow? I don't think the coach will be running today.

Oh.

Miss Rabbit's coach has arrived at Peppa's house.

Goodness me! How did you get through all that snow?

With my big snow plough!

Snow plough's pushed the snow after the way.

Hello, everyone!

Hello, Peppa!

All of Peppa's friends are going to the seaside, too.

Next stop, the seaside!

Hooray!

Mr Bull and his friends are gritting the road. The grit melts the snow.

Hello, Mr Bull!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grandpa Pig's Computer



Oh! Hello, Miss Rabbit! It's taken us all night. But the road is clear all the way to the seaside.

That's good. We're going to the seaside. Would you like to come along?

No, thanks, Miss Rabbit. We've got more roads to grit.

Goodbye, Mr Bull.

Bye, have a lovely day at the beach.

We're all going on a seaside holiday. Sand castles, swimming and sunny skies. We're all going on a seaside holiday. Sea and sun and ice-cream, too!

Here we are! The seaside!

The beach is covered in snow.

Oh!

That sea looks cold.

I was looking forward to having a swim.

You still can! The sea's not frozen over. Come along, girls! What are you waiting for?

Oh, I can't swim because I sprain my ankle.

And I think I might have a cough.

Come on in, Mummy Pig. It's lovely.

Are you sure it's lovely?

Of course, the sea is wonderful today.

OK, then.

Mummy Pig is going for a swim.

Oh ho.

Is it cold, mummy?

It's a little bit cold.

It always feels cold when you first get in.

If you keep moving, you'll warm up.

OK, I'll keep moving.

Mummy Pig has run out of the sea.

Let's get you dry.


Peppa, George and Daddy Pig are warming Mummy Pig up by rubbing her with towels.

Oh, that's better. Are you going for a swim, Daddy Pig?

Maybe not today.

Who wants an ice-cream?

Me, me, me!

Everyone likes ice creams of the seaside.

I wanted to make sand castles. But the beach is covered in snow.

We could make snow castles.

Woo.

First, we fill the buckets with snow. We turn the buckets upside down. Give them a little tap. And hey presto, a snow castle!

Snow castles!

I love the seaside!

And I love the snow!

I love the seaside and the snow!

Haha haha.

We're all going on a seaside holiday. Sand castles, swimming and sunny skies. We're all going on a seaside holiday. Sea and sun and ice-cream, too!


Peppa and George arrived at Grandpa Pig's house.

Grandpa Pig.

What's this? A cuckoo clock?

Yes, it goes "cuckoo, cuckoo", but it's broken. Can you mend it please, Grandpa Pig?

En, let's take it to my shed.

This is Grandpa Pig's shed, where grandpa mends things.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grandpa Pig's Computer



I'll take a look inside.

Grandpa, now you've really broken it.

Oh, I wonder if I've got a book on clocks. Ah, here we are  how clocks work.

Grandpa Pig has mended the cuckoo clock.

Hooray!

Cuckoo, cuckoo.

Mummy Pig has come to pick up Peppa and George.

Mummy, grandpa's mended the cuckoo clock.

That's nice.

What's that?

It's my old computer.

I can't mend that.

It's not broken. I've got a new computer. I thought you might like my old one.

Emm, I am not sure I really need one.

Oh, a computer. What does it do?

You can do letters with it.

Look, granny.

A, b, c, d.

And numbers.

, , .

I am afraid you might break it by pressing the wrong button.

Don't worry, you can't break it.

Just don't feed it milk or biscuits or jelly.

Ha ha ha!

The best thing it does is "Happy Mrs Chicken". When you press this button, she lays an egg. I am very good at it, but George is the best.

That's fun.

Perhaps we should keep the computer,


Granny Pig?

Goodbye.

Bye bye.

Shall we do some work on the computer, Granny Pig?

Yes, let's do some numbers and letters.

Peppa and her family are having lunch.

I've given my old computer to granny and grandpa.

That's nice.

I wonder how they're getting on with it.

Hello, Peppa Pig speaking.

Ah, Peppa, I need to ask a question about the computer.

It's grandpa. He's broken the computer.

What's the problem with the computer, Grandpa Pig?

It's full of eggs.

Eggs?

Happy Mrs Chicken won't lay any more eggs.

I am broken.

Turn the computer off. Now turn it back on again. Did that fix it?

I am very broken.

That doesn't sound good. Maybe it can't be mended. We'll come around and pick it up.

Granny, we're here to take the computer back.

Oh, Grandpa Pig has taken it to his shed.

There. That should do it.

I am mended.

Hooray.

My grandpa is the best at mending things.

Was it very hard to mend?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Hospital



Not at all. I found I had this book  how computers work.

So you don't want us to take the computer away now.

No. I need it for important work.

For letter and number work?

No, to beat Granny Pig's Happy Mrs Chicken's score.

I laid  eggs.

Wow.

So I've got some work to do. Catching up.



It is play time at school. Peppa and her friends are running around having fun.

Oh, that hurts.

Are you all right, Peppa?

I've hurt my knee.

Madame Gazelle, Peppa has fallen over.

You just grazed your knee, Peppa.

First, Madame Gazelle cleans Peppa's knee. Then she puts a plaster on it.

Does it feel any better?

Yes. Thank you.

Now, children, you may have noticed that Pedro Pony isn't here today.

Is he late again?

No, Suzy. Pedro is in hospital.

Woooo.

And today, we are going to visit him.

This is the hospital. Peppa and her friends have come to visit Pedro.

Remember, children, stay close to me. I


don't want you get lost.

Yes, Madame Gazelle!

Excuse me, Mr Bull, which way is the children's ward?

Down the steps, double doors, right, left, right along the corridor. Up the stairs, third on your left. Or you could just take the lift.

Children's ward!

Pedro will be asleep. Sick people do a lot of sleeping.

Hello, everyone!

Hello, Pedro.

Why aren't you asleep? You don't look sick.

I broke my leg and they put it in this plaster cast.

Wow!

The plaster cast helps Pedro's leg get better.

I grazed my knee and I got a plaster too.

Wow, do you want to draw on my plaster cast?

Yes, please.

The children are all doing drawings on Pedro's plaster cast.

I am drawing a football.

I've drawn some flowers.

Mr Potato.

A parrot.

And I'v drawn a muddy puddle.

Wow, thanks everyone.

You can draw on my plaster, too.

OK, I will draw a little flower.

Thank you. Pedro.

Pedro, what's it like being in hospital?

It is great!

What the nurse is like?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Spring



They give me stickers.

Wow!

And they come whenever I press this button.

Who's that? I wonder?

Could it be Pedro?

What do you want, Pedro? We are very busy.

I've got a bit of an itch.

Even if your leg is itching, we can't take the cast off until your leg is better.

It is not my leg that is itching. It is my ear.

Is that better?

Yes, thank you.

Lunch time! What would you like to eat today, Pedro?

Can I have spaghetti and sponge pudding, please?

You get your dinner in bed?

Yes.

That looks tasty.

Doctor Brown Bear has come to see how Pedro is doing.

How are we, today, Pedro?

My ear is a bit itchy. Just here.

I say you are almost better.

Visiting time is over.

Bye, Pedro!

Bye, everyone.

Get well soon, Pedro!

Yes, Madame Gazelle.

It is another school day. Peppa and her friends are playing in the playground.

Madame Gazelle, my plaster had fallen off. Can I have another one?



You don't need a plaster, Peppa. Your knee is better.

Oh, yes.

Hello, everyone.

Pedro Pony is back.

Oh, hello, Pedro. Where is your plaster cast?

They take it off because my leg is better.

Is your leg stronger now?

It's stronger than it was before. It is a super leg.

Can you run on it?

Watch this!

Pedro likes running around having fun.

Everybody likes running around having fun.



It is spring time. Grandpa Pig has made a chocolate egg hunt.

Is everybody ready?

No, grandpa. Freddy Fox isn't here.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Freddy.

Ah, hello, Mr Fox. Are you staying?

I wish I could. I loved egg hunt when I was a little lad. See you later, Freddy.

Now, are you ready for the egg hunt?

Yes, Grandpa Pig.

There are lots of chocolate eggs hidden in my garden. You must find them.

Easy.

But be careful not to step on my little plants.

Oh, it's so exciting in spring time to see these baby plants starting to grow.

We promise to be careful, grandpa.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Spring



Very good. Off you go then.

Grandpa Pig's chocolate egg hunt has begun.

Have you got time for a cup of tea, Grandpa Pig?

Oh, yes. It will take them ages to find my eggs. I've hidden them very well.

Here's an egg.

Peppa has found a chocolate egg in a plant pot.

Here's another egg.

Rebecca Rabbit has found a chocolate egg hiding under a leafy bush.

Hurray, an egg for me.

Emily Elephant has found a chocolate egg in the branches of a tree.

I think I can smell chocolate.

Freddy Fox has a very good sense of smell.

Yes.

Freddy Fox has found a chocolate egg in the middle of a bird bath.

Grandpa, Grandpa, we found chocolate eggs.

It was really fun.

But it was a bit easy.

It wasn't easy for the little ones.

George, Richard and Edmond haven't found any eggs.

I wonder where the other eggs are...

Chocolate egg.

Ah, Edmond, I think there's something behind your ear.

Every one has found a chocolate egg.

What do we do now, Grandpa Pig?

You eat them, of course.

Hello, children.


Granny, granny, we've found all the chocolate eggs.

Oh, where are they? I can't see any eggs.

They are in our tummies.

And around your mouth.

Ha ha ha.

Did grandpa hide the eggs well?

No, we big ones found them easily.

But the little ones needed helping.

George, Richard and Edmod don't like to be the littlest ones.

Don't worry. There'll soon be even littler ones in the garden.

Oh, yes. The little babies. It's so exciting.

Grandpa already told us about the baby plants, granny. But it's not that exciting.

We're not talking about baby plants, Peppa.

Oh, what are you talking about?

Let's go and see Jemima, Vanessa, Sarah, and Neville.

They are chickens.

Yes, and they have eggs, too.

Can we eat them?

No, Freddy. These eggs are about to hatch. Oh, we are just in time.

The baby chicks are hatching.

Oh, baby chicks.

Now the chicks have hatched. It really is the spring time.

Let's pretend to be baby chicks.

I'm a little chick, singing cheep, cheep, cheep. I like to pick up food with my beak, beak, beak. I've fluffy yellow hair and straw for my bed. And I jump up and down, singing cheep, cheep, cheep.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Miss Rabbit's Helicopter




Peppa and her family have come to the summer fete.

Look, A display of rescue vehicles.

Granddad Dog is showing his pick-up truck

This is the sound my pick-up truck makes.

Mummy Sheep is showing the fire engine.

This is the sound fire engine makes.

And Miss Rabbit is showing her rescue helicopter.

This is the sound my helicopter makes.

Helicopter, reversing. Helicopter, reversing.

Would you like to go for a ride?

Yes! Please.

Ok! Hop in!

Oh dear! There is no room for me! Never mind, I'll watch from the ground.

Daddy Pig doesn't like heights.

Whee hee! We are going up in the air!

Yes! It can go straight up. It can go straight down. It can even loop the loop!

Poor Daddy! He is missing all the fun!

Yes, poor Daddy!

One ice-cream, please. Mmm... that's nice.

Maybe we should land now.

Emergency! Emergency! Calling rescue helicopter!

I'm on my way! You're in luck! We've got a job to do!

Mr Bull is digging up the road.

Moo, hello, Miss Rabbit! I've got a big metal pipe that needs lifting!

OK, Mr Bull!


How can you lift that big pipe?

With my big magnet.

Hooray!

What are you going to do with the pipe?

Um... I'm not really sure... I know!

I'll put it down here where someone can easily find it. Now I can give you a lift home.

Oh, what about Daddy?

Hello?

Daddy Pig, can you make your own way home? Miss Rabbit is giving us a lift.

OK!

Daddy Daddy! We went up and down, and round and round!

Ho ho, I'm really sad to miss that. See you back at home!

Who put that pipe there? I know, I'll take a shortcut!

Mmm... It's a bit muddy! Come on, car! Daddy Pig needs to get home!

Daddy Pig is stuck.

I'll ring for Granddad Dog's pick-up truck.

Hello! Breakdown recovery.

I'm stuck in the mud, can you come and rescue me, please?

Sorry, Daddy Pig, I'm moving a big metal pipe that some maniac has left on the road! I'll pass you on to the next rescue service.

Hello, fire service!

I'm stuck in the mud! Can you rescue me, please?

Sorry, Daddy Pig, I'm rescuing a tortoise that stuck up a tree.

Come down, tortoise. I don't know why you like climbing trees. You are a tortoise.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Baby Alexander



Don't worry, Daddy Pig, I'll pass you on to the highest rescue service in the land.

What's that noise? Whoa... I'm flying!

Miss Rabbit's helicopter has rescued Daddy Pig.

Hooray!

Lucky Daddy get a helicopter ride after all!

Shall we show him what my helicopter can do?

Yes!

It can go straight up!

Whoa!

It can go straight down!

Whoa!

It can even loop the loop!

Whoooaaa!

Everyone likes going up and down and round and round in Miss Rabbit's helicopter.



Peppa and George's cousins are coming to visit today.

Mummy, how long before Cousin Chlo is here?

Not long now Peppa. Baby Alexander is coming too, remember?

Oh! Babies cry all the time. They are so noisy.

I'm sure Baby Alexander won't be that noisy.

What's that sound?

Is it a car alarm?

Is it a fire engine?

No, it's Baby Alexander.

Hello Peppa! Hello George!

Hello Cousin Chlo!


Hello everyone!

Hello Uncle Pig!

Hello!

Hello Auntie Pig!

You remember Baby Alexander, don't you, Peppa?

Yes!

Are you staying for a few days?

No, this is what Alexander needs for just one day.

Can't go anywhere without all these baby things.

Oh.

Hello Baby Alexander.

He can't talk, Peppa.

If he can't talk then how do you know what he wants?

We guess. I'm guessing he is hungry.

Peppa, would you like to help feed Alexander?

Yes, please.

It is lunch time for Baby Alexander.

Cousin Peppa is going to feed you today, Alexander.

Here you are baby.

Wah!

Oh, here it is.

Wah!

Oh, he keeps turning his head.

Feeding Baby Alexander is quite hard.

Watch this. Here comes the aeroplane. Woo!

Alexander likes it if you pretend the spoon is an aeroplane.

You have a go, Peppa.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grampy Rabbit's Lighthouse



Here comes the aeroplane. Errrrrrrrrr. Open your mouth and in through the doors. Shh.

Hurray!

That was an aeroplane. Can you say "aeroplane"?

I told you he can't talk!

He hasn't even said his first word yet.

Peppa, do you remember what your first word was?

No.

It was "Mummy".

I thought Peppa's first word was "Daddy".

No, "Mummy".

What was George's first word?

Dinosaur.

George's first word was "dinosaur".

Somebody looks like that he had a good lunch.

Yes, bath time I think.

Baby Alexander is having a bath.

This is Mr Dinosaur. Can you say "dinosaur"?

Goo-goo!

He can't talk, Peppa.

But he will talk one day. Then you'll know what he wants.

What do you want to do now, Alexander?

Goo-goo.

I think he wants to go for a walk.

He can't walk yet but he can go out in his buggy.

That's a clever little buggy.

Yes, five gears, mud guards, and ABS as standard.

Blah, blah, blah. That's how daddies talk.

Alexander likes it when you talk, Peppa.


That's because I am very interesting.

Ha ha ha!

This is the sky. Can you say "sky"?

Goo-goo.

The sky is where rain comes from. Can you say "rain"? Rain is good for ducks and plants and making muddy puddles!

Peppa has found a big muddy puddle.

Look Alexander! I'm jumping up and down in a puddle. I love jumping up and down in puddles.

Puddles.

Woo!

Alexander has said his first word! Puddles!

Hurray! Puddles!

And I taught him to say it!

Puddles.



Peppa, George and Danny are having a day out on Granddad Dog's boat.

Can we go to Pirate Island today?

Yes, Danny. But first, we've got to deliver supplies to my friend, Grampy Rabbit.

Where does Grampy Rabbit live?

On a rock!

On a rock?

Yes, in that lighthouse!

Wow!

Ahoy there, matey!

I've brought your supplies.

Oh. Thank you, Granddad Dog.

I got my crew with me today. Danny, Peppa, and George.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grampy Rabbit's Lighthouse



Visitors? I haven't had visitors in many a moment.

I get a bit lonely, with just sea and sky for company.

How long have you been here?

Since Tuesday.

Oh.

I've got tales to tell, if you'd like to hear?

No, thanks.

Yes, please.

Well. There's the sea under sky, and... I'm learning the banjo. Would you like to hear a song?

No, thanks.

Yes, please.

I got up this morning. The sea was still there. And so was the sky.

The sea, the sky. The sea, the sky.

Here's your cheese.

Oh, I've missed cheese.

And a new book!

How to Run a Lighthouse. Oh, that will come in handy.

Why is your house called a lighthouse?

I'll show you, Peppa.

The staircase goes round and round to the very top of the lighthouse.

Round, and round, and round!

It's called a lighthouse, because it has this big light at the top.

Wow!

It shines through the dark helping sailors to find their way.

Woo!


And when it's foggy, I use this foghorn. FOG!

That's loud!

No fog today. Just sea and sky. The stories I could tell...

No, thank you. We've got to go.

We are sailing to Pirate Island.

Goodbye, Grampy Rabbit.

Enjoy the sea and the sky!

We will.

Granddad Dog's boat has arrived at Pirate Island.

Look! Our sand castle is still here.

Let's play hide and seek.

OK. One, two, three...

There're not many places to hide on Pirate Island.

Ready or not? Here I come. Found you!

Oh!

Now, where is George?

Granddad Dog cannot find George anywhere.

I give up. Where's he?

Boo!

George was hiding behind Granddad Dog.

Clever George! Let's set off home before it gets dark.

Oh, it is getting dark!

Don't worry! The light from Grampy Rabbit's lighthouse will show us the way home.

Grampy Rabbit is ready for bed.

Oh. My new book "How to Run a Lighthouse". Chapter .

Oh. I'll read the rest tomorrow. Better turn the light out.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Miss Rabbit's Day Off



Oh! Where did the light go?

Do you know what time it is? I've just turned the light out.

Yes, we know. Could you turn the big light on again?

Oh, sorry!

Hurray!

It's getting foggy.

I can't see the light anymore.

It's us again. Could you sound the foghorn?

Of course. FOG!

I can hear something.

Grampy Rabbit is guiding them home. His voice is a foghorn!

This way, this way home.

The parents are here to pick up the children.

Have you had a lovely time?

We went to Pirate Island.

And to a lighthouse!

Grampy Rabbit's lighthouse guided us home safely.

That's nice.

Grampy Rabbit sang a song. Would you like to hear it?

No, thanks.

Yes, please.

I got up this morning. The sea was still there. And so was the sky. The sea, the sky. The sea, the sky.



Peppa, George, and Suzy Sheep have had a sleepover at Rabbit's house.


It's fun having carrots for breakfast, Mummy Rabbit.

Yes, we always have carrots for breakfast.

I could eat carrots all day, but I'd better go to work. Have a nice day!

Bye bye!

Mummy Rabbit, why don't you work?

I do work, Suzy. Who do you think looks after these two little bunnies?

You do, mummy.

And you can help me by tidying up your toys please, before someone trips over them.

That would be my sister.

Hello!

Hello, Miss Rabbit!

Auntie!

I can't stop long. I've got lots of work to do today! I've got the supermarket check-out, the ice-cream stall, and the bus to drive. See you later then, sister!

Bye, sister!

Whoops! Whoooooa!

Miss Rabbit has tripped over one of Richard's toys.

Oh, my ankle. I can still hop to work.

No, you stay here and get better.

But I've got so much work to do.

I'll do your work for you. Which job is first?

The supermarket.

OK, Rebecca, look after your auntie.

Yes, mummy.

Mummy Rabbit has arrived at the supermarket.

Thank goodness! You are here, Miss Rabbit.

Miss Rabbit is ill. I'll be doing her job today.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Secret Club



Are you not Miss Rabbit?

No, I'm her sister, Mummy Rabbit. Is this where I sit?

Eh, yes. Have you ever worked at check-out before?

No.

How much is this?

Oh, I don't know.

I've got a voucher.

Do you take book tokens?

Can I pay with a card?

Em...

Suzy Sheep is dressed up her nurse costume.

Don't worry. I'm only a pretend nurse. Stick your tongue out and say "Ah".

Ah!

Rebecca Rabbit's house. Who's speaking, please?

It's Mummy Rabbit. Is everything ok?

Yes.

Good. Because this job could take me all day...

What's about Miss Rabbit's other jobs?

We need more help.

Miss Rabbit's ice-cream stall.

Daddy, why are you buying an ice-cream?

Oh, Peppa, I was on the way to the gym, when I thought an ice-cream would be nice.

Miss Rabbit is ill. You've got to sell the ice-cream today.

Oh, I am an expert of ice-cream.

Can I have a cherry ice-cream?

Eh, strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, banana...

With pistachio and strawberry please.


Strawberry. Oh, it's melted. How about ice-cream soup, instead?

Granddad Dog's breakdown service!

Miss Rabbit is ill. Can you drive her bus today?

Of course, Peppa.

All aboard.

Mummy Sheep's car has broken down.

Granddad Dog's breakdown service!

Can you rescue me, please?

I'll be straight there!

We would like to apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to your journey.

Driving a bus is quite hard. Selling ice-cream is quite hard. Running a supermarket check-out is quite hard.

Eh, I'm feeling better. Can I get up now?

No, you must lie very still, but please keep breathing.

Are you feeling any better, Miss Rabbit?

It's not easy doing all your jobs.

It's not easy looking after your little bunnies.

You will be back to work tomorrow, won't you?

Yes, and you'll be back at home, won't you?

Yes.



Peppa has come to play with Suzy Sheep.

Hello, Suzy.

Hello, Peppa.

Why have you got that mask on your face?

So people don't know it's me. I'm in a secret club.

Wow. Can I be in your secret club?

Sh! It's not easy to get into. You have to say the




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Secret Club



secret word.

What word?

Blaba double!

Blaba double!

Right, you're in.

Danny Dog has come to play.

Hello, Peppa. Hello, Suzy.

Sh!

What?

I'm in a secret club.

Im in it too.

Woo!

Pedro Pony, Candy Cat and Rebecca Rabbit have come to play.

Hello.

Sh!

Suzy and Peppa have been in a secret club.

Can we join your secret club?

It's very hard to get into.

You have to say the secret word. Shalana cookie.

Shalana cookie.

That's not the word I said.

It changes all the time. To keep it secret.

Oh.

Are we in the secret club now?

You're in.

What do we do?

We do secret things in secret.

And secretly go on secret missions.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Show us how you do a secret mission.


Yes! Show us!

Er, Peppa can do it.

You've got the mask on, Suzy.

Okay. My secret mission is to get biscuits. Watch this.

Suzy Sheep is trying not to be seen.

Mummy, can I have some biscuits for my friends, please?

Of course. Here you are.

Thank you, Mummy.

Suzy Sheep has returned with the biscuits.

Hooray.

Sh!

Hooray.

Did anyone see you?

No. Well, only a grown-up.

Look out!

Would you like some juice to go with your biscuits?

What biscuits?

The biscuits that I just gave you for your friends.

Oh, Suzy!

What's the matter?

We're in a secret club, doing secret things. And Suzy's told everyone.

Oh. Can I be in your secret club, please? Please, I've always wanted to be in a secret club.

It's very hard to get into.

You must say the secret word?

Which is?

Pick niddle noodle.

Pick niddle noodle.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grampy Rabbit's Boatyard



That's it. You're in.

What happens now?

Look out!

It's Daddy Pig.

You talk to my Daddy

But don't say anything about our secret club.

Hello! Aha, there you're, Mummy Sheep. What's new?

Er, er, er, secret club.

Oh, no!

Oh. I've always wanted to be in a secret club. Can I join, please?

You can't join, Daddy, because you're a grown-up.

Er, my Mummy is a grown-up.

Well, you have to know the magic word.

Which is?

Pappa diddo dodo dum.

Pappa diddo dodo dum.

You're in.

What do I do now?

Look out!

It's Mummy Pig.

Follow Mummy in secret.

Daddy Pig?

Ah, hello, Mummy Pig.

What're you doing in that bush?

Er, er, secret club.

Oh. I've always wanted to be in a secret club.

We can't have everyone in the secret club. It wouldn't be a secret.

Oh.

I suppose it doesn't have to be a secret secret club.


It can be everybody's secret club.

And everybody can be in it.

Oh, goodie.



Peppa, George and Granny Pig are going out for a day on Grandpa Pig's boat.

Ahoy there! Peppa and George!

We are ready to go sailing.

I'll move the boat a bit nearer.

Careful you don't hit that big stick, grandpa!

That's a mooring post. I won't hit it. Oh.

Grandpa, there's a big hole in your boat.

It's just a scratch.

Woo! Grandpa's boat is sinking.

Quick, Grandpa Pig, jump off!

A captain never leaves his sinking ship.

Grandpa Pig's boat has sunk to the bottom of the river.

It is Granddad Dog.

Woof! Ahoy there, Grandpa Pig! Lovely day for a sail.

I'm... Yes, ahoy there!

I'm taking my boat to the boatyard today.

Going to get a few repairs done.

Would you mind taking my boat to the boatyard, too? Please...

Of course. Where is your boat?

Um... I'm standing on it.

Hoho. Has it sunk?

Well, a little bit.

I'm surprised your boat didn't sink a long time ago.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grampy Rabbit's Boatyard



What?! It's a better boat than that rust bucket of yours.

Woof! Woof! Woof!

Oink! Oink! Oink!

Grandpa Pig and Granddad Dog are very best friends.

Catch this, Captain!

Aye aye, Skipper!

Granddad's truck has lifted Grandpa Pig's boat out of the water.

Wow.

Next stop, the boatyard.

What's the boatyard?

A boatyard, Peppa, is where broken boats get mended.

This is Grampy Rabbit's boatyard.

Ahoy there. Me hearties!

Ahoy there, Grampy Rabbit!

Woo, who did that to your boat, Grandpa Pig?

Um... Someone drove it into a mooring post.

It went rush and made a big hole there.

You should never let other people steer your boat, Grandpa Pig.

Um... yes. Can you mend it?

Of course, I just need to size up the damage.

Grampy Rabbit is measuring the hole in Grandpa Pig's boat.

Now, I need to find something to patch it up.

It must be good to know how to mend a boat.

Oh, it takes years to learn how to mend a boat.


How long have you been mending boats?

Years.

Grampy Rabbit has collected lots of scrap metal to mend boats with.

Now this is a gold mine.

It's a pile of rubbish!

But you can make things from piles of rubbish.

Like what?

Like submarine!

Wow!

Grampy Rabbit has made a submarine out of rubbish.

Does it actually work?

Watch this! It fills up with water so it's very good at going down. But not so good at coming back up.

Now this is what I've been looking for.

It's a washing machine.

It's the fix for Grandpa Pig's boat. It's what it is.

You are going to mend my boat with a bit of washing machine?

Yes! That's as good as new!

Hooray!

Now we test it. Prepare for launch!

Aye, aye!

Amazing! It floats!

You sound surprised.

Yes, usually they sink on the first go.

Now we can go for our day on the river.

What a splendid idea. This is the life out on a boat with just the sea and the sky!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Shake, Rattle and Bang



I know a song about the sea and the sky. Do you want to hear it?

No, thank you.

Yes, please.

I got up this morning. The sea was still there. So was the sky.

Ha ha ha ha ha.

I got up this morning. The sea was still there. So was the sky. The sea, the sky, the sea, the sky. The sea, the sky, the sea, the sky.


Peppa and her friends are at playgroup.

Today children, we are going to learn about instruments that you shake, rattle and bang.

Hooray!

First, choose an instrument each from the music room.

I've got drums!

They are called bongo drums, Danny.

You bang them with your hands like this.

I've got a flat bongo drum.

That is a bodhran. It is Irish. You beat it with a little stick like this.

I've got a tambourine!

Very good, Pedro! You can also shake it like this.

Woo!

I've got a big drum.

Ah! The bass drum.

I don't know what this is called. But it's scrappy.

That, Candy, is called a guiro. And it comes all the way from the South America!

Wow!


How did it get here?

I brought it back from my holiday.

What are these?

They are maracas. I brought them back from my holiday in Spain!

This is a triangle. My dad sells these in boxes of ten.

Thank you, Freddy. I will remember that.

You don't need to go on holiday to get them.

Thank you!

What are these?

These are castanets.

My dad sells them in boxes of five.

Thank you, Freddy. That is how you play the castanets. Here you are, Emily.

Do I have to do the dance?

Ha ha, no! Just make the clickety-clack noise.

Ah! I see Rebecca has cymbals.

Yes!

Now you know what your instruments sound like. We can play them all together.

Ready...

Steady, go!

Stop! Stop! Stop! That is not music. That is just noise.

Anybody can bang, bang, bang. But to make music, you have to listen to each other and keep in time.

Madame Gazelle, I can't listen and do music.

Can you clap?

Yes.

If you can clap, you can make music.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Champion Daddy Pig



All the girls, please copy me. Now, boys.

Madame Gazelle has made the clapping into music.

And, stop. Now, we will learn how to play our instruments together.

The parents have come to pick up the children.

Ah! You are just in time! May I present the Shake, Rattle and Bang Orchestra?

Hooray!

Children! Ready, steady, go!

Bravo!

Perhaps some of my old pupils would like to join in too. Find your instruments, children.

Yes, Madame Gazelle!

Madame Gazelle used to teach all the mummies and daddies when they were little.

It's quite hard, daddy. But you do it like this.

Let me see if I've got that right.

Daddy, you can play the drum!

I'm a bit of an expert at drumming.

That's good shake, rattle and banging. Now perform!

My daddy can shake, rattle and bang!



Peppa and her family are watching sport on television.

It's a long jump. It's a new world record!

Mummy, what's a world record?

It means you are best in the world at something.

Then you are a champion, and your name goes in a book.

There are champions for running, jumping,


swimming...

I wish you were in the book, daddy.

I am in the book.

No!

Yes, Daddy Pig is champion puddle jumper.

Wow...

No one's beaten me yet. I don't think they ever will.

The next event is the puddle jump.

That was a very big splash. In fact, I think yes!

It's a new world record!

Oh!

Daddy, you are not the champion any more.

Everyone will be sad.

Ho ho, I'm sure they've got more important things to worry about, Peppa.

Daddy Pig, you've lost the world record

Everyone wants you to be champion again.

It's important.

Really?

Yes.

Ok. I'll do it tomorrow.

Hurray!

But I'll have to train myself to jump in muddy puddles again.

Everyone knows how to jump in muddy puddles, daddy.

Aha, but not everyone is a champion, Peppa.

Daddy Pig is the master.

Daddy, are you going to practice jumping up and down?

No, Peppa. I must be at one with the puddle.

What?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Chatterbox



To jump in a puddle, I must think like a puddle.

Do you need to do running?

No.

Do you need to do press-ups?

No. I need to sleep and dream about puddles.

It is the day of the big puddle jump. Daddy Pig is wearing his puddle jumping costume.

I can't find my golden boots.

I gave those old boots to grandpa for his gardening.

My lucky golden boots to be used as gardening boots!

You've got other ones.

It's not the same.

Hello?

Grandpa, remember those old boots I gave you?

Uh... yes?

Daddy needs them back urgently. You have been looking after them?

Um... they have been watered.

Grandpa Pig is growing tomatoes in daddy's lucky boots.

We need them for the puddle jump today.

Righto! I'll meet you there.

Everyone has come to watch Daddy Pig's puddle jump.

Please welcome your friend and mine Mr Potato.

Hurray!

Good luck, Daddy Pig. Oh, but where are your lucky boots?

Uh, here they are.

Thank you, Grandpa Pig. I can smell tomatoes.


And now for Daddy Pig's puddle jump.

Daddy Pig is thinking.

Ready, steady, go!

I must become one with the puddle. I must be the puddle. Wow!

The puddle has gone!

The puddle has gone over all of us.

Daddy Pig has become one with the puddle.

Everyone has become one with the puddle.

It's a new world record!

Hurray!

Champion Daddy Pig!

And who is this?

I'm Peppa Pig. One day, I will be the champion puddle jumper.

I've been training her.

Uh... to be trained by the master. What have you learned?

Uh... if you jump in muddy puddles, you must wear your boots.



It's a lovely sunny day, and Suzy Sheep has come to play with Peppa.

Hello, Suzy!

Hello, Peppa!

Peppa and Suzy are best friends.

Guess what happened to me yesterday?

Yesterday I went to the duck pond and I saw Mrs Duck.

Well, yesterday...

Then I went to the supermarket with mummy. We bought bread, carrots and ... What's wrong?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Chatterbox



You talk too much, blah, blah, blah, just like that.

Blah, blah, blah.

Mummy, Suzy said I talked too much.

Well, you are a bit of chatterbox, Peppa.

Chatter box, that's right. Chatterbox here, chatter box there, chatter, chatter, chatter. You never stop talking.

I can easily stop talking if I want to.

No, you can't.

Yes, I can.

You can't!

That's it. I am never going to talk again!

Hello, Suzy. Hello Peppa!

Hello, Zoe, you look nice today.

Thank you, Suzy, this is my new dress. Why are you not talking, Peppa?

Yes, why are you not talking Peppa?

This is a silly game.

What game are you playing?

Suzy said I was a chatterbox and I could never be quiet.

You are not being very quiet now, are you?

Right, I am not going to talk ever again, starting now!

Hello, everyone!

Hello, Danny!

Hello, Danny!

What's the matter with Peppa?

She is not talking.

Oh, who wants the grape?

Me, please.

Me, please.

Mmm! Mmm!


You can't nod your head. That's cheating. And you can't blink.

Hello, everyone!

Hello, Pedro!

What's the matter with Peppa?

She is never going to talk ever again.

Why?

Because she talks too much.

I do not talk too much. Anyway, you are always walking like this. Oh look at me. I am Suzy Sheep.

See what I mean?

And you say this micky macky boo baa boo.

That's nothing like me.

It's a bit like you, Suzy.

You are just as noisy as me.

I can be quiet.

It's not easy.

It's not that tough, Peppa.

Ok, you do it then.

Let's all do it.

We can show my mummy.

Mummy, we are all going to be quiet.

Very queit.

So quiet. You can drop something on the floor and hear it.

Quiet as a mouse.

You are not being quiet at all. You are all being very noisy.

We can be quiet whenever we want.

Start being quiet on the count of three. One, two...

I am not ready. Ok, now




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mr Fox's Van



On your mark.

Ready?

Get set!

Three!

Hello, I am home. Oh I thought the house was empty.

Peppa and her friends are playing being quiet.

It's not playing. It's very hard work.

Oh, Peppa!

Peppa cannot stop herself from talking.

Oh, daddy, I think I might be a chatterbox.

That's not such a bad thing, Peppa. It's good to talk. In fact, I think you are an expert at talking.

That's right. I am an expert at talking.

I am an expert at talking, too.

No one not. I am a chatterbox!

I am more of a chatterbox than you.

Ho ho, you two are just the same.

Yes, we are.

That's why we are best friends.

Chatter, chatter, chatter ...

Chatter, chatter, chatter...

Peppa loves talking, Suzy loves talking.

Everybody loves talking.



It is a lovely, sunny day. Peppa is playing with her friends.

It's Freddy Fox.

Hello, everyone!

Hello, Freddy!


Come on! Let's cycle to the big hill.

Yeah!

Good morning, Mr Fox!

It's afternoon, Mr Pig!

Afternoon? Already? My watch must have stopped.

My shop sells watches and clocks. Let me see what I've got in a van.

One grandfather clock!

It's a bit big!

Good, isn't it? It actually comes in a set of three.

Oh.

Who's got the loudest bell?

I haven't got a bell.

Oh!

But my dad will have one in the back of his van.

Three clocks are much better than one.

Dad, have you got a bicycle bell, please?

How many do you want, son?

I only want one.

I do them in boxes of two.

Freddy Fox now has two bicycle bells.

Brilliant! Thanks, dad!

Dad gave me two bells.

Wow!

What else has your dad got in his van?

He's got everything!

Woo!

What shall we play now?

Let's have a bicycle race!

With a big, shiny cup for the winner.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Chloe's Big Friends



But where can we get a cup?

Yes, where can we get a cup?

I'll see what I can do.

The best thing about having your own cement mixer is that...

Dad, have you got a big shiny winner's cup for our bicycle race, please?

How important a race is it?

It's very important.

Will this do?

Well, thanks, dad. It's gold!

Yes, it's plastic gold!

Woo!

One winner's cup. It's made of plastic gold!

Wow!

Your daddy's van really has got everything!

Yep!

Let's race to Peppa's house!

Ready? Steady? Go!

Press this button and it just disappears!

Wow! Ah!

And if you push this button, you can play CDs!

The friends have all finished together.

Everyone is a winner!

But we've only got one cup.

My van has a winner's cup for everyone!

Hooray!

Mr Fox, is there anything you don't have in your van?

Try me!

Have you got a banjo?

Four or five-string?


You won't have a tree in your van?

Apple or pear?

I bet you haven't got a rocket in there.

Boxes of five.

What's about a chicken?

One chicken!

Mr Fox's van is magic!

It's a super van!

Yes, it's. Come on, Freddy. We'd better get home!

Goodbye, everyone!

Bye!

Have you got a bouncy castle?

Yep!

A garden shed?

Yep! I've got everything! Oh, I've got no petrol.

Mr Fox has everything in his van except petrol.

Oh I need to get to the petrol station.

I would tow you, but I haven't got a tow rope.

Oh, I have got plenty of them. I do them in packs of five.

Can we come along, too?

Why not.

Daddy Pig is towing Mr Fox's van to the petrol station.



Peppa and her family are on their way to visit cousin Chloe.

I love playing with big cousin Chloe.

Chloe... Chloe...

Oh, Chloe.

Hi, there. These are my friends, Simon Squirrel and



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Chloe's Big Friends



Belinda Bear.

You can call me Si. It's short for Simon.

And I'm Be. It's short for Belinda.

I'm Peppa.

We'll call you Pe.

Oh... And this is George.

We'll call you Ge.

Oh...

You didn't tell us you have baby cousins, Chloe.

I'm not a baby.

But you are both little.

I am a big girl. George is little.

Eh... Why don't we all play a game?

Yes. Let's play "Hide and seek".

We don't play baby games any more.

We are almost grown-up.

What's about the "Yes No game"?

What's the "Yes No game"?

I ask things and you answer.

What makes that a game?

You mustn't say yes or no.

Too easy.

Do you want to play then?

Yes.

Aha. You said yes.

That's not fair. I wasn't ready.

Be, are you ready?

Yes.

Aha. I win again!

Peppa is very good at playing the "Yes No game".


Can I ask the questions?

Of course.

You don't mind me asking you the questions?

I don't mind.

Am I ever going to make you say yes or no?

I don't think so.

Oh, I give up. How do you always win?

Easy. I just don't say yes or no.

Ah, I win. You said yes and no.

That was fun.

Let's play another game.

Have you ever played "Sardines"?

What's that?

Someone hides and we all try to find them.

That sounds like "Hide and seek".

But when you find them, you keep quiet and hide in the same space until everyone is hiding there.

Like sardines in a tin.

All right. Let's try it.

George, you hide first.

One, two, three ...

George is looking for somewhere to hide.

Nine, ten. Ready or not, here we come.

George, I can see your wiggly tail.

Peppa is hiding with George.

Move over, George.

Found you.

Now, Chloe must squeeze in with Peppa and George.

Move up.

There you all are.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Gym Class



Now, Belinda Bear must squeeze in, too.

Good job. We're like sardines in a tin.

Where's everyone gone?

Surprise.

Ah... Can we stop running around now?

Yeah. Let's just chew out.

Chew out? What's that?

We just sit around and talk about stuff.

I like talking. Blah...blah...blah...

Let's talk about music. I dig blues music.

I like red's music.

I like green's music.

We don't like children's music.

No, no, no.

What music are you into?

I like this. It's very grown-up.

Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes. Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes, and eyes and ears and mouth and nose. Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes.

Peppa. George. It's time to go home now.

Ah!

You will see Chloe again soon.

I'm coming to your house next week, Peppa.

Can we come along, too?

You can come. But we will be playing games.

We like playing games with Peppa and George.

Hooray!

You can still have fun playing games, even when you're almost grown up.



Peppa and her friends are going to the gym today.

Let's check you've all got your gym kits on.

Pedro is wearing a super hero costume.

Pedro, where is your gym kits?

It's at home. I thought it was dressing-up day!

Follow me, children.

This is the gym where mummies and daddies come to exercise and enjoy themselves.

Are you all having fun?

Yes, lots of fun.

Your gym teacher for today is Grampy Rabbit.

Where is he?

Hello, children. Are you ready to exercise?

Yes, Grampy Rabbit.

Do we have to do that?

No, that's surely for big athletes like me.

Not for little explorers like you.

We are not explorers.

I'll make explorers of you. But you, you look like a super hero.

It's just pretend.

Pretending, that's good. Right, let's warm up. Everyone run on the spot and flap your arms.

Now, stretch. Stretch. Wobble like a jelly.

And, rest. Now we're all warmed up. We can start.

Start what?

Your adventure. I want you to pretend that this room is a jungle.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Blackberry Bush



It doesn't look like a jungle.

Where're the trees?

You have to imagine it. The trees, the rain, the fast clean river at your feet. Your first adventure is to walk on this beam across the river.

That's easy!

But it's night time and it's windy.

What's?

That's how it was for me. It was a dark and stormy night. I was on an adventure. Ready?

But it's not windy or night time.

You have to pretend.

Everyone crosses the pretend river safely.

Hurray!

Well done! My little explorers.

What's next, Grampy Rabbit?

Your next adventure is to swim across this swamp full of crocodiles.

Ah!

I can't see any crocodiles.

You've got to pretend.

Let those crocodiles know who's boss.

Go away! You naughty crocodiles.

That's the spirit.

Did you ever swim across a crocodile swamp?

Of course, I did.

Were you scared?

Not scared as they were of me. Aha! Ready? Don't forget to do the call.

Aha!

Everyone has crossed the pretend crocodile swamp safely.

Well done!


What's our next adventure?

This is a vault, big athlete jump over it, like this. But you can pretend it's a dinosaur, and crawl through its legs.

Have you crawled through a dinosaur's legs, Grampy Rabbit?

Oh, yes. Once I was walking in the jungle, when I stumbled into a lost world of dinosaurs.

And that's it! You've made it out of a jungle.

Hurray!

Did you have a good gym class, children?

Yes, Madame Gazelle.

They're real little explorers now.

We walked across a river.

And we swam over crocodiles.

And we crawled under a dinosaur.

I love doing gym class with Grampy Rabbit.



Peppa and her family are at Granny and Grandpa Pig's house.

Today, I'm going to make apple and blackberry crumble.

Yummy!

I need you bravest explorers to go and get the fruit.

Aye aye! Granny Pig!

We've got baskets for the apples.

And buckets for the blackberries.

First, the easy bit  picking apples. On the count of three, shake the tree.

One! Two! Three!



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Blackberry Bush



Now for the blackberries.

Why don't we just have apple crumble?

Because blackberries are tasty too, Grandpa.

OK. Now the hard bit.

Now that's what I call a blackberry bush.

This bush has been here since I was a little piggy.

It's an overgrown weed. I should've cut it down years ago.

Grandpa, why don't you like it?

I don't like the way it looks at me.

Silly Grandpa. It's just a harmless bush.

And it's covered in lovely blackberries.

George has seen some really big juicy blackberries.

Careful George, or you might get tangled. I have a stick for picking hard-to-Reach blackberries.

Clever Grandpa!

But the best blackberries are right at the very top. That's why I brought the ladder.

Um, don't lean too far over, Mummy Pig.

Don't worry. I've been climbing this blackberry bush since I was a little girl.

Yes, but you are not a little girl now.

I know what I'm doing.

Oh, dear! Mummy Pig has fallen into the blackberry bush.

Mummy! Can you get out?

No, I'm stuck.

You're stuck in the thorny bush like Sleeping Beauty.

What?

Once upon a time, there was a princess called Sleeping Beauty. One day she fell asleep in a thorny bush.


And she stayed there for a hundred years.

That's a nice story, Peppa.

It is Suzy Sheep.

Hello, Peppa.

Hello, Suzy. My Mummy is in a blackberry bush.

And she'll be there for a hundred years.

Like Sleeping Beauty? And she'll be rescued by a handsome prince who will give her a kiss.

My Mummy is having an adventure.

I wish my mummy would have adventures like that.

Um, can someone think of a way to get me out of here?

Don't worry, Mummy. In a hundred years a handsome prince will rescue you.

I'll be that handsome prince. Grandpa Pig, may I borrow your pruning shears please?

Of course you may, Brave Sir Daddy Pig.

Stand back everyone. Take that, you thorny bush you!

Hurray!

Oh, my prince.

My princess.

You were meant to stay in there for a hundred years!

That was quite long enough. Thank you.

Mummy is a blackberry bush.

I thought this sort of thing only happened to me!

Stand still while we pick you.

Let's take all this fruit back to Granny Pig.

Granny! Granny! Mummy had an adventure! And then Mummy fell in a bush. She looked quite silly and she was going 'Ah! Help me! Help me!' And then Daddy came and rescued her. The end.

Thank you, Peppa. I think we've all heard



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pottery



that story enough times now.

But it's funny.

I never want to see another blackberry in my life.

So you don't want any apple and blackberry crumble then?

Well. Mmm. Delicious.

Mummy Pig loves apple and blackberry crumble.

Everyone loves apple and blackberry crumble.



Peppa and George are playing at Zoe Zebra's house. Little Zuzu and Zaza are making a jungle with play-clay. George has made a dinosaur out of play-clay. Peppa and Zoe are having a dolls' picnic.

Hello, Mr Monkey. Would you like a cup of tea?

Oh oh oh! Monkey says yes.

What's the magic word, Mr Monkey?

Oh oh oh! That means please.

Oh! We haven't got a tea-set.

We could make a tea-set out of play-clay.

Yes. George, can we use your play-clay please?

No.

Zuzu, Zaza, we need to make a tea-set for our tea party.

No.

You can help us make it.

I'll make the teapot.

And we'll make the cups.

There. Now monkey can have tea. Oh! This teapot is too soft.

Real tea-sets aren't soft.

My mummy makes real pots. She does pottery.


Woo!

Mummy, can you help us make a tea-set please?

Real teacups and a teapot that we can put real water in.

Okay. Come with me.

This is where Mrs Zebra makes her pottery.

Let's make this tea-set.

What's that?

Clay. All pottery starts off like that.

That is soft, like play-clay.

We need it to be soft, so we can shape it. But later it won't be soft.

Mummy Zebra is making a little cup on the potter's wheel.

There, one cup.

Wow.

That looks easy.

Would you like to try?

Yes, please.

It's all slimy. Ah, it's all gone wrong.

Making a cup on a potter's wheel is not easy.

There is an easier way to make a cup. First, roll the clay into a long worm like this.

It's a wriggly worm!

I'm a wriggly worm. I'm made of clay. What shall I make today? I'm a wriggly worm.

We wrap it round and round like this.

It's a bit bumpy.

No, I smooth it out with my hands and I add a handle.

It's a cup.

Now we have two cups.

Yes, but a tea-set needs more than two cups.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Paper Aeroplanes



We'll all make cups.

Yes.

Dinosaur.

George has made a dinosaur. George always makes dinosaurs.

What a scary dinosaur!

Now we need to bed the tea-set in a kiln.

A kiln is an oven, cooks the clay and makes it hard.

The tea-set should be ready.

Hooray.

Now we paint them.

The children are painting the tea-set lovely bright colors. The tea-set is finished.

Now we can have our tea party.

There is a cup for everyone.

Oh, we forgot to make a teapot.

I know. George's dinosaur can be the teapot.

Yes, let's fill it with water.

This is the best tea-set in the world!

Everybody knows that all the finest tea-sets have a dinosaur in them.

Teapot. Errr!



Daddy Pig is getting ready to go to work.

Good, that's all the paper I need. Bye

Byebye Daddy!

Mummy, can we make something?

Yes, what would you like to make?

Dinosaur!

Oh, George! You always say dinosaur for


everything!

Let's make an aeroplane.

George likes aeroplanes.

Can we make an aeroplane that flies?

Yes, all we need is some paper!

We know where there is the paper.

There is lots of old paper in the workroom.

Here's some paper.

Perfect!

Mummy Pig is going to make a paper aeroplane.

Fold the paper down the middle. Now fold the corners in at one end. Fold both corners in again to make a point. Then fold the sides back like this.

Paper aeroplanes.

Let's see if they can fly! Ready, steady, go!

Woo!

Mummy Pig's aeroplane has flown into a tree.

My turn! Wee!

Peppa's aeroplane has landed in a flower pot.

Your turn, George.

Wee!

George's aeroplane is doing a loop-the-Loop, and has landed in a duck pond.

Quack quack!

Let's make a big aeroplane.

We will need a really big piece of paper.

Here is a big piece of blue paper.

Peppa and George have made a big blue aeroplane.

Daddy Pig!

Hello, everyone.

Shouldn't you be at work?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Edmond Elephant's Birthday



Yes, but I've forgotten some important papers.

Daddy, we are making aeroplanes. We made a really big one.

Wow, fantastic. You need someone big and strong to throw it. Ready, steady, go!

The big blue aeroplane is flying very high and very far.

It just keeps on going!

Bye-Bye, aeroplane.

Ho ho, byebye!

Now I need to find my important work papers. Has anyone seen any pieces of paper?

Mmm. Uh, maybe you should follow me. Is this one of your important papers?

Yes, that's one of them.

Is this one of your important papers, Daddy?

Yes, thank you, Peppa.

Hm, why are we at the duck pond? Oh, I see! Thank you, Mrs Duck.

The only paper I'm missing now is a big blue print.

Hm, is it big and blue?

Like the aeroplane you've flown a long way away, Daddy?

Oh! Mmm...

The one that we said bye-bye to?

Yes, maybe I should ring the office.

This is Daddy Pig's office.

Hello, Daddy Pig, did you find the papers?

I found some of them.

The only one we need is the big blue print.

That might be a problem.

Daddy threw it away.


Threw it away?

And it flew and flew forever.

Wow, it's here. It's just landed on my desk.

Eh?

What a great idea to make it into a paper aeroplane and throw it to us!

Oh, yes. Well. I am a bit of an expert at throwing things.

Thank you, Daddy Pig.

Now the blue print is delivered. Daddy Pig can take the rest of the day off work.

Ah, that's nice.

Daddy, we need your newspaper.

What for?

Making paper aeroplanes.

Ho ho ho ho ho ho!



Mr Zebra, the postman is delivering a letter to Peppa's house.

Oh look, someone's got a party invitation!

It must be for me!

It says, 'To George Pig, from Edmond Elephant, please come to my party!'

Doesn't it say 'George and Peppa'?

No. Just George.

Hm... I didn't want to go to a silly baby party anyway!

Hello. Oh, it's for you Peppa. It's Emily Elephant.

Hello.

Hello Peppa. Do you want to come to Edmond's party as my friend?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Biggest Muddy Puddle



Oh yes please!

My mummy wants us to help with the little ones.

Help? Yes! I can help!

Danny and Suzy are helpers too.

Oh, goodies!

Everyone is here for Edmond Elephant's party.

Oh the helpers are here.

Hello Mrs Elephant!

Let's get this party started! Who wants to play "Musical Statues"?

Yeah!

This is what you do. Dance when the music is playing. And when it stops, freeze like a statue.

Ready? Steady? Go!

Just dance already!

This one is still blinking. You are out!

You're moving, George. You are out.

Richard and Edmond are out.

So Zaza is the winner.

Hurray!

You've got a medal.

It's made of real plastic gold.

Mummy, "Musical Statues" is over.

Lovely! Now it's time for "Pass the Parcel".

Yeah!

When the music plays, pass the parcel round.

When the music stops, take some paper off.

Ready? Steady? Go!

George! Pass the parcel!

Edmond has got a medal.

Hurry up, Richard!


Just take the paper off.

Richard has got a medal. George has got a medal.

Pass the parcel!

Oh dear, George isn't passing the parcel.

No, George. That's Zaza's medal!

It's a giant teddy!

Edmond has won!

Mummy, "Pass the Parcel" is finished.

Hm...lovely! Now it's time for food.

Hurray!

Oh... The helpers have taken all the seats.

This is Edmond's party, remember? The helpers can eat after the little ones.

Oh yes. We're the helpers.

Juice please!

Juice please!

Juice please!

Jelly please

Jelly. Jelly!

More please!

Happy birthday, Edmond!

Happy birthday, Edmond!

It is the end of the party.

Thank you, to the helpers. You've all worked really hard!

Yes. It's not easy looking after little children.

Hm... I need to lie down.

I need a holiday.



It is bed time for Peppa and George.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Biggest Muddy Puddle



There is so much rain.

That means there will be puddles to jump in tomorrow.

Oh goody!

You can never have too much rain!

It is morning.

Hurray! Muddy puddles!

Oh, hello Mrs Duck. What are you doing here? Wow!

The rain has made a flood.

Our house is a desert island.

Muddy puddles, here I come! Wee! Oh? Who put all these water here?

How will we get our food?

Daddy will have to swim to the shops.

Grandpa Pig has arrived on his boat.

Ahoy there! Wonderful boating weather!

Eh, yes.

We are sailing to the shops. Do you need anything?

Yes, please. Can you get us some tomatoes and spaghetti?

Tomatoes and spaghetti.

Polly Parrot copies everything that is said.

Polly can be our shopping list. Who is a clever parrot?

Who is a very clever parrot?

Can we come too, please?

Hop on board.

Look, there is Suzy Sheep's house

We are going to the shops. Do you need anything?

Mummy, do we need anything from the shops?


Yes, we need food for dinner.

Chocolate, please!

Chocolate.

Hello Danny!

Hello Peppa, I am helping my granddad.

We are rescuing people.

Great weather for it!

Do you need anything from the shops?

Maybe a newspaper.

And a comic

Newspaper, comic.

Grandpa, what's that stick thing in the water?

Argh! Submarine. Action stations!

Ahoy there, me hearties.

It's Grampy Rabbit in his submarine!

Lovely day to go sailing with just the sea and the sky. The stories I could tell ...

Do you need any shopping?

Oh, yes, cheese please!

Cheese.

Grandpa Pig's boat has arrived at the supermarket.

Hello, it is very quiet today. You are my first customers.

Maybe it's because of the flood

Silly, isn't it? A little bit of rain, and everyone stays at home. What can I get you?

Polly has a list.

Who's a clever parrot? Who's a clever parrot?

Oh dear, Polly has forgotten the list.

Luckily, I remember what everyone wants.

Cheese!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Santa's Grotto



Thank you, Peppa. You are a good'un.

Newspaper and comic!

Thanks, Peppa.

It was lucky Peppa was going to the shops. Or we'll have nothing for the dinner!

Here's your chocolates.

Now we can have our dinner, mummy!

Peppa and George have arrived back home. It is their bed time.

It is morning. The water has gone, but left a big muddy puddle.

Muddy puddle! This is the biggest muddy puddle in the world ever!



It is Christmas Eve.

Hands up! Who wants to go and see Father Christmas?

Me! Me! Me!

Are we going to the North Pole?

Not quite that far, Peppa.

But Father Christmas lives at the North Pole!

Lucky for us, he's got a grotto at the Christmas fair.

Peppa and George have come to visit Santa's grotto.

Hello, everyone!

Hello!

All aboard the elf train! This way to Santa's Grotto!

Suzy, what are you asking Father Christmas for?

I don't know! What are you asking for?

I would like a doll that walks and talks and closes his eyes when it goes to sleep!


I'll ask for that too.

How does Father Christmas remember what toys everybody wants?

He makes a list!

His sleigh must be very fast to go around the whole world in one night!

It is a super sleigh!

Father Christmas is very old!

He is hundreds of years old!

Even older than my daddy!

Santa's grotto!

Ho, ho, ho! Hello everyone!

Hello, Father Christmas!

Have you all been good?

Yes!

Have you all kept your bedrooms tidy?

Yes!

Have you?

Ho ho ho, of course! Now come and tell me what you would like for Christmas?

Woof, woof! Can I have a football, please?

A xylophone!

Tiddly Winks!

A magic set, please!

Racing car!

Bouncing ball! Boing boing!

A train, please!

A toy train.

Not a toy train, a real train. One I can drive with real passengers.

Ho, ho, I will see what I can do. Is that everyone?

We haven't seen you yet.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Santa's Visit



I am sorry, what is your name?

I am Peppa Pig. We have met before!

Yes, nice to see you again, Peppa! What would you like for Christmas?

I would like a doll that walks and talks and closes its eyes when it goes to sleep, please!

Eh, the same for me, please!

Very good!

You do know where I live, don't you?

Oh, yes.

How old are you?

I am hundreds of years old.

I told you!

Goodbye, Father Christmas!

Don't forget to leave me a mince pie and...

And a drink, we know!

And carrots for the reindeer!

Ho ho ho!

Peppa and her family are driving back from the Christmas fair.

Daddy, why have we got our bags in the car?

We are spending our Christmas at granny and grandpa's house!

But Father Christmas won't know where we are!

Don't worry Peppa. Father Christmas knows everything!

Granny Pig. It is nearly Christmas!

Yes! And I have got a very important job for you! Stir the Christmas pudding and make a wish!

Peppa and George are making a wish!

Racing car!

Oh! Don't tell me what it is!

He he.


Here's the mince pie and a drink for Father Christmas!

And a carrot for the reindeer!

Who can that be at this time of night! We are not buying anything!

Merry joyful greetings. Best happy tune.

Hello singers!

Snow's falling gently. Christmas time here.

Oh, Merry Christmas!

It is bed time for Peppa and George.

This used to be my bedroom when I was a little piggy.

Father Christmas knows where granny and grandpa live, doesn't he?

Oh yes, he has been here many times before.

Good night, Peppa. Good night, George.

Peppa and George have fallen asleep. When they wake up, it will be Christmas day.



It is very early on Christmas morning. Peppa and her family are staying at granny and Grandpa Pig's house.

George, wake up! Santa has been!

Bubble mix, comics, and tangerines!

Mummy, daddy, it's Christmas!

Hey, what?

It's too early, Peppa.

Go and say "Happy Christmas" to granny and grandpa.

Granny, grandpa!

Argh!

Don't panic! All hands on deck!

It's Christmas!



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Santa's Visit



It's three o'clock in the morning!

But Santa's been. Can we see if he is still here?

No, Santa is not here. Look, the carrot, drink and mince pie have gone.

He has only left crumbs.

Yes, Santa likes the good mince pie.

And there are big presents under the tree! I asked Santa for a doll. Can we open them now?

We will open the big presents after Christmas lunch.

Oh, goody!

Peppa and her family are having Christmas lunch.

Let's pull the crackers!

There are paper hats inside.

And party trumpets.

And jokes! What wobbles in the sky?

I don't know.

A jelly-copter.

Mmm... This Christmas pudding is delicious!

Peppa and George, helped me make it.

We did the stirring.

Did you make a wish, Peppa?

Yes. I wished for...

Don't tell us.

Let's open the presents!

Yippee!

This one is for George.

It is a racing car set.

This looks a bit complicated.

Let me see. This goes here and that goes there and this goes there.


Let's race!

Ready! Steady! Go!

Daddy and grandpa are enjoying playing racing cars.

Isn't that George's present?

I think George is quite happy playing with the box.

This is your present, Daddy Pig.

Ah, socks!

And I've got, socks!

Socks!

Socks!

Socks!

So, the last present must be for...

Me! I asked Santa for a doll that walks and talks and closes its eyes when it goes to sleep.

Oh, birdseed.

Birdseed.

That present is for Polly Parrot.

But it was the last one. Santa has forgotten me.

Hello?

Can I talk to Peppa please?

Peppa, it's Suzy Sheep.

Hello, Suzy.

Did you get your doll?

No.

I got mine. It cries and laughs and closes its eyes and everything.

Santa has given you my doll!

No. The label says, "For Suzy Sheep."

And Santa has forgotten me.

Ho ho ho.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Santa's Visit


Santa is on his way home.

That's the last of this year's toys delivered. Oh!

What's this at the bottom of my sack?

Santa can't have forgotten you.

I have been a good piggy, haven't I?

Ho ho ho!

Santa!

Ah... hello!

He came down our chimney!

Of course he did, granny!

Here's your present, Peppa. Sorry it's a bit late.

My doll! Thank you, Santa.

Would you like some Christmas pudding?

George and I stirred it and made wishes.

Mmm... Yummy!

And I wish that Santa would visit us on Christmas

day and you did.

Ho ho ho!

Peppa Pig Season 	. Potato City




Peppa and her family are going to Potato City.

What is Potato City, Mummy?

It is a theme park, Peppa, where the magic of vegetables never ends.

It sounds a bit boring.

It will be fun. Potato City, here we come. Here we are.

The family have arrived at a field of potatoes.

Is this Potato City?

It must be. And it looks like we pick the right day to visit. There are no crowds.

Are you sure this is the right place, Daddy Pig? It just looks like a farmer's field to me.

Excuse me, is this Potato City?

No! That's Potato City.

It isn't quite what I was expecting.

It is fantastic!

How many tickets?

Two adults and two children please, Miss Rabbit.

Busy, isn't it?

Busy? No. This is quiet for Potato City. Have a lovely day!

Peppa's friends have come to Potato City, too.

Hello everyone.

Hello Peppa.

And this is Mr Potato himself.

Welcome to Potato City, where the magic of vegetables never ends!

Ooh!

See how vegetables grow! Learn how they keep us fit and healthy and get shot into space by the



potato rocket!

Whee! Wow!

Peppa and her friends are going to ride on the potato rocket. George wants to ride on the potato rocket too.

Are you sure George? It looks a bit high.

Daddy Pig doesn't like heights.

Moo, hurry up Daddy Pig!

Oh! I'm not getting on.

George is too small to go on his own.

Oh, okay. Make it quick.

Oh, it's very quick.

George has changed his mind.

Oh dear George, come to Mummy.

Maybe I'll just get off too.

Chocks away.

Have fun Daddy Pig!

Aaaaaaaah! Oh, it's stopped. Well, I'm glad that's all over.

Wee!

Aaaaaaah!

This is brilliant!

Wee!

Everybody off!

That was fun, wasn't it, Daddy?

Oh, yes! Lots of fun.

Mummy, what's that?

Go round and put your head through that hole.

Now what happens?

Suzy, you are a tomato!

Look! I'm a carrot!


	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The New House



Oh yes!

And I'm a pumpkin!

Welcome to the Dinosaur Garden!

Ooh!

Say hello to my dinosaur friends! And don't be frightened. They are not real, but this is exactly how they would have looked walking the earth together.

No, it's not.

What?

Triceratops lived in the Cretaceous period. Stegosaurus was Jurassic. They would not have walked together.

How do you know that?

I'm a clever clogs.

Anyway, who wants to ride one?

Me!

Me!

Why have you got dinosaurs in Potato City?

Uh, because dinosaurs ate potatoes?

No.

Anyway, children like dinosaurs.

Dinosaur!

Dinosaur!

Roll up, roll up! For the vegetable roundabout swing thing.

A vegetable roundabout swing thing! I like Potato City because it teaches you about vegetables and swings you round and round.

Potato City, where the magic of vegetables never ends!

Up down up down, altogether now. Mr Potato was rolling around. Your friends are mine, he's happy all the time. Mr Potato is coming to town.



Daddy Pig is working hard in his work room.

What are you doing, Daddy?

I'm building a new house.

It's very small. Is it a house for elves and fairies?

Oh, no. This is a model. The real house will be much bigger.

Ah?

And this is a drawing of what needs to be built.

I think something is missing, Daddy. There!

Peppa has drawn a swing to go outside the house.

Perfect. Would you like to visit the new house?

Yes, please!

Daddy Pig is taking Peppa and George to see the house he's building.

Here we are!

But Daddy, there's nothing here.

That's because the building work hasn't started yet.

Digger! Digger!

Here are Mr Bull and his friends.

Mr Bull has come to build the new house.

Aren't you building it, Daddy?

I've done the hard bit. Mr Bull just has to follow my instructions.

Hello, Mr Pig! What is it to be? Car park?

Swimming pool? Rocket station?

A house! Can you build it exactly like this please?

But bigger.

Mr Pig wants a house.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The New House



Is it going to be built of straw?

Or sticks?

Or bricks, Mr Pig?

Bricks, please!

Good choice.

Don't forget the swing!

Don't worry, Peppa. We won't.

Can I help?

George wants to help too.

OK, George!

Could you put a blob of mortar here?

It looks like a square of tin mud.

Mortar is a very special kind of mud that sticks bricks together.

Peppa, would you like to lie the first brick?

Yes, please!

Well done! I'll do the rest.

Bricks must be laid straight on level, see? Line after line.

That will take ages!

Yes.

Will you finish it today?

Oh, no. You can't build a house in a day. It'll be finished tomorrow.

Good! See you tomorrow, Mr Bull!

Bye-bye.

Bye.

George put the sticky mud down, and I put the brick on top.

That all sounds very exciting. Now, close your eyes and go to sleep.

It is morning. Peppa and George cannot wait to see the new house.


It's finished.

Almost finished. It just needs to be inspected.

Mr Rabbit is the building inspector.

Very good. But wait! It's not finished.

What?

You forgot the swing.

Moo! Oh, no. We didn't.

Thank you, Mr Bull.

Now it's all ready for our new neighbours to move in.

Neighbours?

Yes, Peppa. We've got new neighbours.

Mr Wolf and his family are moving into their new home.

Oh, look, little piggies.

Hello, I'm Wendy wolf.

I'm Peppa pig.

Thank you for building our house, Mr Pig. What's it made of, straw, sticks?

It's made of bricks.

Let's see how strong it is. I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll...

Mmm, that is strong. What's your own house made of, Mr Pig?

Bricks. So don't even think about it!

Oh, a swing.

That was my idea.

It's very good. You have a go.

Can you push me?

No, I'll huff and puff instead.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Basketball




It is a lovely sunny day. Peppa and her friends are in the school playground.

Children, today we have a special person coming to teach you basketball.

Ooh!

Hello!

Daddy, it isn't home time yet!

We've got a special teacher coming today.

That's me. I'm the coach.

A basketball teacher is called a coach.

Ooh!

That's clever, Daddy.

Peppa, call me Coach!

OK, Daddy Coach.

Does anyone know how to play basketball?

No!

It's fun. You have to run, bounce the ball, and throw it through the hoop.

Wow!

Easy peasy! Oh!

It is not as easy as it looks.

To play basketball, you need to train hard and keep fit.

Are you fit, Daddy Coach?

Yes, I'm super fit.

But Daddy Coach, you've got a big tummy.

This tummy is pure muscle.

First, I'll teach you how to get the ball from here... to here.

I can do that.

No, Danny, you can't use your feet. That's


football.

Danny Dog likes football.

In basketball, you bounce the ball with your hands, like this. Who wants a go?

Me, me, me!

Suzy Sheep is bouncing the basketball very carefully.

Well done, Suzy. Now, everyone try.

Everyone is learning how to bounce the ball.

Now, I'll teach you tackling.

What's tackling?

Tackling is try to get the ball from another player, like this. Try get the ball from me, George.

George is very good at tackling.

Now, throw the ball through the hoop.

You need just a bit more training there, George.

Let's have a little practice game. Split into two teams.

Boys against girls.

The girls are in one team. The boys are in the other.

That's not fair! We've got little ones in our team.

Don't worry, the boys' team will still win.

Yeah, we're a super team!

Emily Elephant is very good at reaching high with her trunk.

Emily is using her trunk. It's not fair.

Shh, Peppa. She's on our side.

Oh yes, that is fair.

It's not fair.

We want Emily on our team.

No, she's on our team.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Horsey Twinkle Toes



Stop arguing! You can all then in the same team.

OK.

The children are all in one big team.

Oh, but who will we play?

Um... Well...

Hello!

The parents have come to take the children home.

I know! You can play the grown-ups.

But they are bigger than us.

Ah! But you've been taught basketball by Daddy Coach.

Yes, let's play them.

We're the children's team.

Yeah!

We're the grown-ups' team.

All right!

I'm quite good at cricket.

Yes, well, this is basketball.

You throw the ball through the hoop.

But you can only use your hands.

Or your trunk.

But not your feet.

Ready? Steady? Go!

Mr Elephant has the ball. Tackled by George.

Passed to Zoe Zebra. To Richard Rabbit. And Peppa...

throws it through the hoop.

Yippee!

The children have won!

Hooray!

All thanks to Daddy Coach.



Peppa and George are playing in their bedroom.

Dinosaur! Grrr...

George, you must stay on your side of the bedroom. That's your side and this is my side. Do not cross the invisible line.

Post!

Hello, Mr Zebra!

Hello, Daddy Pig! I've got some letters for you.

Is there anything for me and George?

Hmm... I'm afraid not. They are all for Mummy and me.

Oh...

There's a parcel as well.

Probably that box of reinforced concrete I ordered.

Look at all the stamps on it.

That's because it's from a long way away. Bye now.

Bye-bye.

Oh, the label says it is for Peppa and George.

Yippee!

Look, Mummy. A parcel for George and me.

Oh!

There's a letter too.

Dear Peppa and George, here's a present for you to share. Love from your Aunty Dottie!

Aunty Dottie lives far away, in another country.

Ooh! What is the present?

It's got wheels.

Car.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Naughty Tortoise



It's not a car, George. It's got legs. It's a table.

It's got a tail.

Oh, tables don't have tails.

There's a handle as well.

What can it be?

There's something else in the box. It's a toy horse. I shall call it Twinkle Toes.

Horsey!

Twinkle Toes!

Horsey!

Twinkle Toes!

Horsey!

Remember children, Aunt Dottie sent the present for both of you.

You have to share. Sharing can be fun.

Can I play with Twinkle Toes first?

Let George have the first turn. He's the youngest.

Horsey! Horsey!

George likes playing with Horsey!

George, it is called Twinkle Toes, not Horsey.

Now, it's Peppa's turn.

I'm Princess Peppa, with my magic horse Twinkle Toes.

Peppa likes playing with Twinkle Toes!

Oops!

Perhaps you should play with the toy horse outside.

Yes, Mummy.

Hmm, it's a bit steep here. Maybe you should play at the bottom of the hill. And the quickest way down the hill is to ride down.

Are your sure, Daddy? Don't crash like you always


do.

Ho ho, I know what I'm doing, Peppa. I'm a grown-up. Yee-hah!

How are you going to stop, Daddy?

I don't know. Where are the brakes?

Clever, Daddy. You used the duck pond to stop.

What was that big splash?

What big splash?

Daddy Pig, did you know you've got a duck on your head?

Oh! Uh... yes, well, I did fall in the pond.

Horsey! Horsey!

George wants to ride on the toy horse.

Go! Go! Oh!

George cannot make the horse go.

If only there was someone big and strong to push George along.

I'm big and strong. I can push George.

What a good idea, Peppa!

Horsey! Horsey!

George, she's called Twinkle Toes.

Horsey!

Twinkle Toes!

Horsey!

I know. Because the present is for both of us. We'll call her Horsey Twinkle Toes!

Peppa and George love playing together, with Horsey Twinkle Toes.



It is a lovely autumn day. Peppa and her friends are playing in the leaves.

Look, it's Tiddles the tortoise.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Naughty Tortoise



Hello, Tiddles, what are you doing here?

Tiddles! Tiddles!

It is Doctor Hamster, the vet.

Here is Tiddles.

Thank goodness, you've found him. Oh, naughty tortoise, back in your box. It's your bed time.

It's not bed time yet.

It's bed time for Tiddles. He sleeps all through the winter and wakes up in spring.

That sounds nice.

You like sleeping, don't you, Pedro?

Yes.

Oh dear, Tiddles?

Tiddles has run away.

Oh!

Look, he's on that tree.

Oh, Tiddles, I don't know why you like climbing trees.

How are we going to rescue Tiddles?

Chop the tree down.

No. I'll ring the fire brigade.

Fire service! What's that? Tortoise up a tree? Again? We're on our way.

Stand clear!

Fire engines use ladders to rescue pets from trees.

Come on, Tiddles.

Tiddles is climbing higher in the tree.

Come here, you little pickle.

Mummy Cow is climbing into the tree.

Be careful, Mummy Cow.

Oh dear, I'm stuck.


Cows are not very good at climbing trees.

Hang on, I'm coming up.

Here, Tiddles. Oh, I'm stuck too.

Elephants are not very good at climbing trees.

Well, that didn't work, did it?

What are we going to do now?

Chop the tree down!

No!

I'll call the next rescue service.

Hello, Granddad Dog's breakdown service.

Hello, Tiddles the tortoise is up a tree.

Tortoise up a tree? Again? Yeah, I'll be right there. Ruff!

Hmm, how do you get tortoises out of trees?

Chop the tree down!

Yes, let's chop the tree down!

No!

OK. I'll climb up instead.

Hooray!

Oh, I seem to be stuck.

Dogs are not very good at climbing trees.

Now, can we chop the tree down?

No! We'll have to call the highest rescue service in the land.

OK, I'm on my way.

It is Miss Rabbit in her rescue helicopter.

Hello, everyone! Let's rescue this tortoise!

Uh, who's flying your helicopter?

Oops! Silly me! I just put the autopilots on.

Autopilot on. Have a nice day.

Autopilots fly helicopters on their own.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mr Fox's Shop



Got you, you little rascal.

Miss Rabbit has rescued Tiddles.

Hooray!

Thank you, Miss Rabbit, for saving my Tiddles.

No problem, ma'am.

Thank you for saving us too.

Just doing my job. Goodbye.

Uh, haven't you forgotten something?

What? Oh, yes. My helicopter! Goodbye, everyone.

Goodbye!

What a naughty tortoise you are!

Uh...

Oh, good. You're sleeping now. Back in your box.

Sleep well, Tiddles.

Tiddles has gone to sleep for the winter. He'll wake again in the spring time.

Shhhhh!



Mummy and Daddy Pig are wrapping up a present.

Ooh! A present! Is it for me, or George?

No, Peppa. It's not for you or George.

Oh, is it a toy?

No, it's a glass vase.

That's a bit of a boring present.

Ho ho, it's a present for grown-ups.

We've bought this for Granny and Grandpa Pig. It's their wedding anniversary.


Can me and George buy them a present, too?

That's very sweet of you, Peppa, but presents can cost a lot of money.

We've got money in our piggy bank.

Peppa and George have one penny and two buttons to spend.

OK, let's go shopping.

This is Mr Fox's shop.

Hello, there! Can I help you?

It's Granny and Grandpa Pig's wedding anniversary.

There're both very old. I need a present.

My shop has everything. I'm sure you'll find something you like.

A big teddy! I love it. This can be the present.

Peppa, the present is not for you. It's for Granny and Grandpa.

Oh, yes.

Oh, look. Funny teeth.

They are wind-up joke teeth, very popular.

Can they be the present for Granny and Grandpa?

I think Granny and Grandpa have all the teeth they need, Peppa.

Do your Granny and Grandpa like gardening and digging?

Yes.

Then why not get them a bucket and spade each.

Buy one, get one free.

They've already got spades and buckets and hoes and everything.

Oh dear.

I know. Grandpa likes sailing his boat.

Say no more. I have everything a sailor could ever wish for.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Shadows



Do you have pirates' treasure?

Uh... everything except pirates' treasure.

Oh.

Do Granny and Grandpa like antiques?

What does antiquy mean?

Antique means old and rare.

Usually yes. But my antiques are brand new. That chair comes in a set of twelve. Nice, isn't it?

Is it made of oak?

Yes, it's made of plastic oak.

Is it comfortable?

You mustn't sit on it. Antique chairs are not for sitting on.

So, what do you do with them?

You look at them.

That's not much fun, even for a grown-up.

Buying a present for Granny and Grandpa is hard work.

I don't understand. My shop sells everything.

There must be something you like.

There is. I like this teddy. And I think Granny and Grandpa would like it, too.

Ho ho! Let's buy the teddy then.

A very good choice. Who's going to pay?

One penny and two buttons. Here's your change.

One button.

Thank you, Mr Fox.

Peppa and her family have come to give Granny and Grandpa Pig their presents.

Granny Pig. Grandpa Pig.

Hello, my little ones.

Happy anniversary!

Oh, another glass vase.


It's a grown-up present. That's why it's a bit boring.

It's lovely. We'll put it with our other glass vases.

George and me bought you a present, too. I hope you like it.

A teddy bear! For Grandpa and me?

Thank you, Peppa and George.

He's very good at cuddling.

Does he have a name?

Um, he's called Eddy the Teddy.

And what does Eddy like to eat?

Chocolate and broccoli.

That's the best present we've ever had.

Oh, but if Eddy's going to live here, he'll need children to play with.

We can play with him, Granny.

And every time you visit us, he'll be here for you to play with.

Oh, goody!



It is a lovely sunny day. Peppa, George and Rebecca Rabbit are playing piggy in the middle.

Catch Peppa.

Catch Rebecca.

George is the piggy in the middle. Oh, George is trying to catch the ball shadow.

Silly George. That's not the ball  that's just its shadow. Look!

When the ball moves, its shadow moves as well.

You've got a shadow too, George.

George is trying to walk away from his shadow.

You can't walk away from your shadow.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Shadows



You need to run away from it.

Peppa is trying to run away from her shadow.

Oh, it's still there.

Hello, everyone!

Hello, Suzy. We're trying to run away from our shadows.

No one can run away from their shadows.

Oh!

You need to use a scooter. Weeeee!

Suzy is trying to ride away from her shadow.

See!

But your shadow is still there.

Oh!

Hello, everyone!

Here is Mr Elephant, with Emily and Edmond.

Hello.

We're trying to run away from our shadows.

You can never run away from your shadow.

I know. We can't go fast enough.

No, Suzy. It's nothing to do with how fast you run. You see? My shadow is still underneath me.

Run faster!

Even if I run faster, my shadow keeps up with me.

Daddy, your shadow is too big. It's slowing you down.

It's not that, Emily. Your shadow always stays with you.

Why?

When something gets in the way of the sun, it makes a shadow, like this.

Oh!

I have the biggest shadow, because I'm the


biggest.

And George and I have the smallest shadows, because we are the smallest.

Very clever, Edmond.

I'm a clever-clogs.

Oh, whose shadow is that?

That's the biggest shadow ever.

It must be a giant.

It's not a giant. The shadow is being made by a cloud.

Wow!

What sort of cloud is it?

Um... it's a big cloud.

It's called a stratocumulus.

Yes.

Edmond Elephant is a clever-clogs.

Look! Our shadows are getting longer.

Ooh!

That's because the sun is getting lower in the sky. It's nearly night time.

My shadow has gone.

Yes, Emily. When the sun sets, the shadows go away.

Peppa, George, bed time.

OK, Daddy. Bye, everyone.

Bye-bye.

It is bed time.

I'm a bit sad that my shadow's gone away.

Don't be sad, Peppa. Electric light can make shadows, and we can make shadow puppets.

Mummy Pig is using her hands to make a shadow puppet.

It's a birdy.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. International Day



Listen to it sing. Tweet, tweet, I'm a little birdy.

My turn.

Peppa has made a spider.

My name is Mr Skinny Legs.

Oops, scary!

George is making a shadow puppet.

What's that, George?

Dinosaur! Grrr...

George has made a dinosaur.

That's really scary.

Very good, George. Time to switch the lights out. Good night, Peppa. Good night, George. Good night, shadows!

Good night, shadows!



Peppa and her friends are at playgroup. They are dressed up in customs from different countries.

Today is International Day, when we celebrate all the countries of the world.

Hurray!

Peppa is dressed as France.

I'm France.

George is Russia. Pedro is America.

Yee-hah!

Zoe is Japan.

Konnichiwa!

Suzy is Holland.

Hallo! That's Dutch for hello.

Madame Gazelle, what do all the countries of the world do?

They sing the song of harmony together.


Hurray!

I like singing.

So do I.

Does anyone remember the words?

Yes, Madame Gazelle.

Peace and harmony in all the world. Peace and harmony in all the world. Peace and harmony in all the world. Peace and harmony.

Lovely, and later we will sing that for your mummies and daddies.

It is the playtime.

Enjoy yourselves. Play nicely together.

All the countries are playing in the playground. The United Kingdom is on the slide. France and Swissland are on the swings. Germany is playing hopscotch.

One, two, three.

America, Russia, Spain and Greece are in the sandpit.

I'm building a big sand castle. Yee-hah!

Here are Holland and Japan.

Now it's our turn in the sandpit.

Why?

Because you've had your turn. You can play on the slide now.

But we want to play here.

Oh, dear. There's not enough room in the sandpit for more than four countries.

What's going on?

It's our turn in the sandpit.

But we are here first.

Is Suzy being a bit bossy?

George started it.

Leave George alone. He's only little.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Rainy Day Game



'Ello, 'ello, 'ello. What's all this noise about, then?

They're trying to push us out of the sandpit.

No, we're not.

Yes, you are.

George started it.

Oh, dear, the countries of the world are not playing nicely together.

Peace and harmony in all the w... What's that noise? Oh, no! The countries are fighting.

You can't play in the sandpit.

Yes, we can.

It's not fair.

Stop arguing.

Suzy, you're always telling people what to do!

No, I am not.

Children, children, what is happening?

America, Russia, Spain and Greece won't share the sandpit.

Holland is being bossy.

You are the bossy one.

That is enough. Is this how you think the countries of the world behave?

Don't they?

Of course not.

Sorry, Madame Gazelle.

Hello.

All the parents have arrived.

How's International Day going?

Not too bad.

Excellent.

Lovely.

We will now sing for you the song of


harmony.

Peace and harmony in all the world. Peace and harmony in all the world. Peace and harmony in all the world. Peace and harmony.

Hurray!

What a wonderful display of togetherness.

Peppa and her friends love singing together in harmony. All the countries of the world love singing together in harmony.


It is raining. Peppa and George have to stay inside.

I don't like rainy days.

I like rainy days because they make muddy puddles to jump in.

Can we jump in muddy puddles now?

Peppa, we need to wait until it stops raining.

When will it stop?

Let's listen to the weather forecast.

This is the weather forecast. It will rain all day.

Oh!

I know. We can play the rainy day game.

What's the rainy day game?

I'll show you.

If I take this rubber duck, and hide it where you can see it. Do you think you could find it?

Daddy, if we can see it, you haven't hidden it.

Watch this. I will put the duck here. Now, you tell me where it is.

There.

Exactly.

It's too easy, Daddy.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Rainy Day Game



It won't always be so easy, Peppa.

Who wants to go first?

Because it's an easy game, George can go first.

OK, you all wait here.

Daddy Pig is putting the rubber duck somewhere for George to find.

The duck is somewhere in your bedroom.

George is looking for the rubber duck. But it is quite difficult to find.

George, you can see it. Just look with your eyes.

George is using his eyes to look for the rubber duck.

You're getting warmer, colder. Warm again.

George has found the rubber duck.

Hooray!

I saw it straight away. This game is too easy.

OK, Peppa's turn. I will do the hiding this time.

Mummy Pig is going to put the rubber duck somewhere for Peppa to find.

I will see it straight away.

Ready! The rubber duck is somewhere in the kitchen.

I've come to find you, rubber ducky.

I know where you are, you're in the sink. Oh.

The rubber duck is not in the sink.

I know, you are hiding under the table.

The rubber duck is not under the table.

Give me a clue, please.

It's sitting with something else that's yellow.

Something yellow that lives in the kitchen. Bananas.

There you are.



Peppa has found the rubber duck. It was in the fruit bowl.

Hooray!

Well done.

I want to play the rainy day game again.

OK, this time you can both look for the duck.

Daddy Pig is putting the rubber duck somewhere for Peppa and George to find.

Ready, I'm in the sitting room.

Is it on the sofa?

No.

Is it on the television?

No.

It's not anywhere.

Would you like a clue? It's sitting on something very big, and very wise.

And very handsome.

Daddy, it's on your head. That's the best hiding place ever.

Oh, the rain has stopped.

Why don't we play outside?

But I want to play the rainy day game again.

I think you might like this outside rainy day game even better.

What is this game? Give me a clue.

We need to find a muddy puddle.

I found it. Is that the game?

This game is not just about the finding, Peppa. What do you do with a muddy puddle?

Hmm, jump up and down. Jumping up and down in muddy puddles!

I like rainy day games, especially the one when you jump up and down in muddy puddles.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mummy Rabbit's Bump




Peppa and George are playing with Suzy Sheep and Pedro Pony. Here are Rebecca and Richard Rabbit.

Hello, Rebecca.

Squeak! I've got a secret.

What is it?

My Mummy's got a bump in her tummy.

Ooh!

Has she eaten too much?

No, there's a baby rabbit inside.

Mummy Rabbit, is there really a baby rabbit in your tummy?

Yes. Would you like to listen to it?

Yes, please.

Can you hear a little heart beat?

Yes, I can. It's going "Boom! Boom! Boom!" Oh, it just moved.

Yes, sometimes babies give a little kick.

What will you call it?

I don't know. Would you children like to think of the name?

Yes, please!

Hello, Mummy Rabbit. Would you like a cup of coffee?

I can't have coffee, but I am quite hungry.

Would you like carrots?

I'm a bit off carrots. Have you got any potatoes?

Yes, we do.

Maybe a potato with jelly, and cheese, and strawberry jam, please.

Urgh!


A potato with jelly, cheese, and strawberry jam? What a funny mixture of food!

We need to think of a name for the baby.

Yes. If the baby is a girl, she'll be called Rachel Rabbit.

Or how about Roost Rabbit?

Roxanne Rabbit.

Sharon Rabbit.

I don't think so, Pedro.

Sharon Rabbit sounds wrong.

I like Rosie.

Rosie Rabbit? It's perfect.

But what if the baby is a boy?

Oh.

How about Rufus Rabbit?

Raymond Rabbit.

Michael Rabbit.

Michael Rabbit? No!

Robbie Rabbit!

Yes, Robbie Rabbit.

Thank you for the potatoes with jelly, cheese, and strawberry jam, Mummy Pig.

My pleasure.

We thought of a name for the baby.

Rosie if it's a girl and Robbie if it's a boy.

They're lovely names.

It's sad that the baby can't have both names.

Oh, my tummy!

It's all that funny food you've been eaten.

I don't think so, Daddy Rabbit. The baby is coming.

Right! To the hospital! Quickly, now! Don't




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pedro the Cowboy



panic!

Bye!

Bye! Good luck.

Did you pack everything on the list?

I've got it all. Pillows, scented candles, yoga music, and enough food for three days.

Don't panic! Don't panic! Anyone in? We are having a rabbit!

Hello, sister. What are you doing here?

I'm having a baby, remember?

Oh, yes! You'd better come inside then.

Can I come too?

Moo! You'll have to park the car first. But don't worry. Having a baby always takes a long time.

Out of the way, everyone. My sister's having a baby.

A kettle and plenty of towels. This lot should last us a good few days.

Oh, where should I put all this stuff?

Back in the car! We don't need it now.

What?

Squeak! Daddy, you missed all the excitement.

Have I? Is it a boy or a girl?

Both! We've got baby twins.

Wow!

It is the next day. And Mummy Rabbit is home from hospital.

Hello, can we see the twins, please?

Of course, Peppa.

Are they boys or girls?

They are both. A boy and a girl.

They are called Rosie and Robbie.

So you did use both names.


Yes!

Rosie Rabbit, and Robbie Rabbit.

They are the best names in the world. And we thought of them.



It is a lovely sunny day. Pedro has a new play tent. Here are Peppa, George, Danny Dog, Suzy Sheep and Wendy Wolf.

Hello, Pedro.

Howdy, everyone. Welcome to my cowboy camp!

Ye-ha!

It's a tent.

It's a cowboy camp where cowboys sleep at night time.

Are you going to sleep here in the night?

Um, no! That might be a bit scary. But we can pretend it's night time.

But it's not night time.

Just pretend the sun is the moon.

OK!

Pedro, can we be cowboys too?

Yes, you could be my partners.

Is my little cowboy hungry?

I sure am, Ma. That's how cowboys speak.

Would you cowboys and cowgirls like something to eat, too?

Yes, please, Ma.

Did a cowboy always camp next to their mummies' kitchen?

No. You have to pretend the house is not here. This is the Wild West.

What's that?

The Wild West is the land where cowboys live.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pedro the Cowboy



What do cowboys do?

They tell stories, sing songs, and eat beans.

Beans on toast for everyone!

Hooray!

Cowboys love beans on toast. Everybody loves beans on toast.

Who wants a cowboy song?

Do you know a real cowboy song?

Yes, I made it up. And it goes like this: I'm a brave cowboy and I'm eating my beans, with a bing and bong and boo. Baked beans bang! Baked beans boo! Baked beans bingly bongly bang!

Baked beans bang! Baked beans boo! Baked beans bingly bongly bang!

Let's have a story in the tent.

I can tell a story.

Make it scary.

It was a wet and windy night in the Wild West.

Ooh!

And wild animals were out looking for food.

Looking for food, at night?

Some animals eat at night, Suzy.

Wild animals.

Grrr...

And the brave cowboy Pedro was alone in his tent.

But he couldn't sleep, because something was outside the tent.

Was it a wild animal?

What's that?

It is a wild animal!

Argh... Oh!

It is a tiny little bird. Come to look at Pedro's tent.


I think it was an eagle. Eagles live in the Wild West.

Is everybody all right?

Yes, Mummy.

It's nearly home time.

But we haven't done the pretend sleeping yet.

Everybody back in the tent.

Hehehe!

Good night, partners!

Good night, cowboy Pedro.

I'm glad there aren't any wild animals out there.

Howl!

Wild animals!

Argh!

It's a wolf.

Yes, it's my daddy.

Howl!

Mr Wolf has come to take Wendy Wolf home.

All their parents are here to pick up the children.

Bye-bye, cowboy Pedro.

Bye-bye, everyone.

Are you coming in, Pedro?

I want a pretend sleeping a bit more.

OK!

Hoot!

Mummy, can I come in now?

Yes, my brave little cowboy.

Even brave little cowboys like to sleep indoors sometimes.

Night, Pedro.

Good night, Ma!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Peppa and George's Garden




Daddy Pig is sitting in his favorite sunny spot.

Ah! What a perfect day for doing nothing!

Daddy Pig loves doing nothing.

How could this be better? I know! A cup of tea!

Grandpa Pig has come to see Peppa and George.

Grandpa Pig.

Baba 'ig!

Hello, Peppa and George! You are going to have your very own flower garden.

Ooh! A garden for George and me!

I've got a packet of flower seeds for each of you. Now, we need a nice sunny spot to plant your seeds.

Here we are!

Grandpa Pig is digging Peppa and George's garden.

Oh!

Ah! Tea for the workers. Thank you, Daddy Pig.

Uh... what's going on?

We are making a flower garden.

Do we need a flower garden?

Yes!

But that's where I sit in my chair.

There are more important things than chairs, Daddy Pig.

But I always read my newspapers here.

There are more important things than newspapers, Daddy Pig.

Yes, like flowers.

Look, Daddy.

Peppa has lots of flower seeds. George only has


one flower seed.

Oh!

But it is quite a big seed.

Could you fetch us some water, Daddy Pig?

Mmm... OK!

Seeds need water to grow. They get very thirsty.

Some little birds have come to watch.

Don't let the birds eat the seeds, Peppa.

Shoo! Shoo! Fly away, birdies.

Here is the water.

Daddy scared the birds away.

Ho ho! Daddy Pig looks like a scarecrow.

Ha ha ha!

Peppa, George, bath time!

Oh, but what if the birdies come back?

Don't worry, Peppa. I'll make sure the birds don't eat the seeds.

Thank you, Daddy.

Good luck, Daddy Pig. See you tomorrow.

Bye! Ah, this is nice.

Daddy, you have to be the scarecrow.

What? Oh! Shoo! Shoo! Naughty birds.

Now, stay there until the birdies go to bed.

OK, Peppa.

All the birdies have gone to bed. Daddy Pig can go inside now.

It is morning.

George, let's look at our flower garden. Ooh! Baby plants.

Morning! Ah, your plants have started to grow. Soon, they'll have flowers on them.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Flying Vet



A little snail has come to take a look.

Oh, dear! Snails like eating plants.

Grandpa Pig, can you take Barbara to your garden?

Um...OK, I'll take care of Barbara.

It is one week later.

Peppa, George, come and look.

My flowers! They are so pretty.

And look at George's plant.

It's a beanstalk. And it goes all the way up to a giant's castle.

Ho ho. No, Peppa. But it does go quite high.

George's flower is taller than our house.

Ho ho! George's grown a sunflower. Well done, George.

I love our flower garden.

Now, let's make you a vegetable garden.

But that's where I sit in my chair.

There are more important things than chairs, Daddy Pig.

Like tomatoes, carrots, and potatoes.

I do like a nice potato.

Daddy pig loves potatoes. Everyone loves potatoes.



Peppa has brought Goldie the fish to the vet for a check-up.

You've got a healthy happy fish. She is lovely.

Thank you, Doctor Hamster!

Hello.

Hello, Doctor Hamster! This is Mr Elephant.

Mr Elephant and his family are out for a walk in


the mountains.

We've found a sick lizard.

It's a gecko.

Edmond knows all about lizards. He is a clever clogs.

I'll be straight there.

Ooh! Can we come too?

Of course! Let's go!

Are we going in an ambulance?

No. The mountain's too far away! We'll go in my aeroplane!

Ooh!

Airplane! Ee-ow!

George loves aeroplanes.

All aboard! Up, up and away!

I didn't know you had an aeroplane, Doctor Hamster!

Oh, yes! I'm the flying vet.

Thank goodness. The vet's here.

Stand aside. Vet coming through!

Where's the sick lizard?

Here it is!

Oh, poor little pickle.

What is wrong with the lizard?

It seems to be upside down. I'll just flip it over. There!

Doctor Hamster has made the lizard better.

Hooray!

Oh, another emergency. Hello.

Hello, Grandpa Pig here.

Grandpa Pig is out sailing his boat.

It's Polly. She's a sick parrot.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Kylie Kangaroo



Er! Sick parrot!

I'll be right there.

Look, Polly. It's the flying vet.

Where are we going to land?

This is a seaplane, Peppa. We can land on the water.

Wow!

Hello! Peppa! George!

Hello, Grandpa. We've come to make Polly better.

How long has Polly been sick?

Since we came out on our boat trip.

Aha! I know what's wrong with Polly.

She's seasick.

Oh!

Get Polly to dry land. The sooner the better.

There's an island.

There we go! Better Polly?

Er! Better Polly!

Hooray!

Polly is not a sick parrot anymore.

Oh, another emergency. Hello.

Hello, Daddy Pig here.

Daddy Pig is in his office.

There are some ducklings stuck on our roof.

I'll be right there.

Thank goodness, you're here.

Stand aside. Doctor Hamster's here.

Mrs Duck laid her eggs on our roof.

And now the ducklings have hatched.

Who can make a quacking noise?

Me! I'm very good at quacking.


Peppa, start quacking and the ducklings will follow you.

Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack!

Lead them to the duck pond please, Peppa.

OK, I'm Mummy Duck. Quack! Quack! Quack!

Quack! Quack! Quack!

The ducklings are back with their mummy and daddy.

All because of me.

Ho ho ho!

Hello.

Is it another emergency?

Yes, it's Mr Hamster. I'm late for my tea. Bye!

Bye bye, Doctor Hamster.

Thank you.

No problem.

It's all in a day's work, for the flying vet.



It is a lovely sunny day. Mr and Mrs Kangaroo have come to visit.

Hello.

G'day, Mr Pig. We met at the airport.

Remember?

Um...

It was a while back. You said we could visit anytime.

Did I?

Yes, since we last saw you. We've had Kylie and Joey. Say hello, kids.

Hello, I'm Kylie Kangaroo.

I'm Peppa Pig. And this is my little brother George.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Kylie Kangaroo



This is my little brother Joey.

Joey lives in Mummy Kangaroo's pocket.

It's thirsty work, this traveling around. Would you like a drink?

Yes, please. Lemonade! My favourite.

Mmm. That's lovely.

Here, sit down. Are you hungry?

I'm always hungry.

No worries. We'll make lunch.

Mr Kangaroo is going to cook lunch on a barbecue.

Corn on the cob. Anyone?

Yummy!

We should do this at our house. Hang on. This is our house.

Come on, Kylie. Let's play in the garden. We can play my favourite game-jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

I like jumping too.

First, we have to find a puddle. Oh, there aren't any muddy puddles.

The ground is too dry for muddy puddles.

I wish it would rain.

I hope it doesn't rain.

Oh, we love rain. We don't see much back home.

Well, if you want to make it rain in this country, have a barbecue.

We can still do jumping. George is quite good at jumping, but I am the best. Watch this.

That's how you do it. Now, you try, Kylie.

OK.

Kangaroos can jump very high.

Wow!


Here is Rebecca Rabbit.

Hello, Rebecca. This is my friend, Kylie.

Hello, Kylie. Squeak! Are you playing a game?

We are jumping.

Rabbits are the best at jumping. Watch this.

Well done, Rebecca! But that's not as good as my friend Kylie. Go on, do your jump!

I don't want to show off.

Do it!

OK.

That is high.

Kylie Kangaroo is the best at jumping.

Here is Pedro Pony.

Hello, everyone!

Hello, Pedro. This is my friend, Kylie Kangaroo.

She's my friend.

She can jump higher than anyone.

No one can jump higher than me on my super space hopper!

Show him, Kylie.

But Pedro did really well.

Do it!

OK.

Wow!

Kylie Kangaroo is the best at jumping.

I can jump higher, but I'm a little bit tired. Ugh! What was that?

It is raining.

Like I said, if you want it to rain, start a barbecue.

I'm afraid we'll all have to go indoors.

What? And miss the rain?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Captain Daddy Dog



Mr Kangaroo has got a big umbrella to shelter everyone from the rain.

Food's ready! Who's hungry?

Me! Me!

Mmm, yummy!

Peppa likes corn on the cob.

Mmm. Mmm.

Everyone likes corn on the cob.

It's stopped raining.

The rain makes everything so fresh and green.

And wet.

And muddy.

This is how you jump in muddy puddles.

Wow! That looks fun. I'm the best at jumping, but Peppa is the best at jumping up and down in muddy puddles.


Peppa and her friends are playing at Danny Dog's house.

I'm a sea captain, sailing across the sea.

We are jolly pirates. Shiver me timbers!

Aha!

It's the post!

It is Mr Zebra, the postman.

Hello, Mummy Dog. I've got a postcard for you.

Thank you, Mr Zebra.

Bye now.

Who's the postcard from, Mummy?

It's from Captain Dog.

Daddy!


He's finished his sailing trip around the world and he's coming home.

Ooh!

How exciting! I wonder when he'll be back.

Ahoy, there, Mr Zebra.

Hello, Captain Dog.

Hello!

Daddy!

Danny!

Daddy!

Danny!

Daddy!

Captain Dog is home from the sea.

My Captain Dog!

Mummy Dog! My sweetheart!

How long are you home for, Daddy?

Forever! I've decided my travelling days are over. I've been around the world and made me fortune.

Ooh!

And lost it again.

Oh!

And made it again.

Hooray!

Ah! I love to travel. But there's something I really miss when I'm away.

What, Daddy?

My darlings, of course!

Ha ha ha.

So I'm hanging up my Captain's hat for good.

Let me tell you all about my travels. I've been away for a year and a day, sailing around the world.

All the way around?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grampy Rabbit's Dinosaur Park



Yes.

What did you do at the bottom?

Did you fall off?

No, I held on tightly.

Wow! What an adventure!

It was, and I brought back presents for all of you.

Ooh! Presents!

Here's a drum for Danny, from a faraway jungle.

Thank you, Daddy.

Very good, Danny.

I can bang it louder.

Perhaps that's enough banging for now.

And for all your friends, some seashells from a desert island.

Ooh!

If you hold them to your ear, you can hear the sea.

Yes, I can hear the seaside.

And for my darling Mummy Dog, a chest of golden jewels.

Oh! How lovely. That will come in handy.

Ah! It's great to be home.

It is morning. Captain Dog is up early.

Daddy, what are you doing?

I'm checking the wind, Danny.

Why?

Sailors always check the wind before they sail.

But you're not a sailor any more.

Oh, yes. I did say that, didn't I?

Do you miss the sea, Daddy?


No, no. I don't miss the sea. But I do miss my boat.

I've got a boat that Granddad Dog made for me.

Aha! That's an exact copy of my boat.

You could help me sail it.

That sounds like fun.

Peppa and her friends are at the duck pond.

Ahoy, there, shipmates. Room for another boat on the briny waters?

Yes.

Excellent! Danny, our boat needs a captain. It can't sail itself.

Daddy, will you be my boat's captain?

I'll be delighted, Danny, if you'll be my first

mate.

Yes, please.

Launch the boat.

Aye aye, Captain!

Wind is southwesterly. The waters are calm.

My last adventure was sailing a boat around the world. My next adventure is sailing a boat across a duck pond! Ah ha ha!

Captain Dog likes sailing across duck ponds.

Everyone likes sailing across duck ponds.



Today is Freddy Fox's birthday and all the children are going on a big adventure.

Where are we going for your birthday, Freddy?

I don't know, but I can't wait to get there!

We're here!

Welcome to Grampy Rabbit's dinosaur park!

Ooh!



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grampy Rabbit's Dinosaur Park



Dinosaur! Grrr!

George loves dinosaurs.

Are there really dinosaurs here?

No. Just pretend ones.

Phew!

Real dinosaurs died out  million years ago.

Edmond knows a lot about dinosaurs. He is a clever clogs.

But we've got better than real dinosaurs. We've got singing dinosaurs!

We are the dinosaurs, the dinosaurs, the dinosaurs. We are the dinosaurs. Listen to us roar. Roar!

They're a bit small.

Yes. Aren't dinosaurs meant to be big?

Ah, yes. We do have a big dinosaur. A real whopper! Um, would you like to meet it?

Yes, please.

These are its footprints. We just have to follow them.

Ooh!

These footprints look very real. Are you sure there's no living dinosaurs about, Grampy Rabbit?

I'm quite sure, Daddy Pig. Over the boulders, everyone! Across the bridge! Through the cave!

Oh, the footprints have stopped.

Look! There are some green steps.

It's a big slide. Whee!

Whee!

Whoa!

Whee!

Wow! It's a big dinosaur!

Yes, it's my whopping ginormous dinosaur slide! Aha ha ha!


That is some dinosaur.

He is a brontosaurus.

Actually, the correct name is Apatosaurus.

You are a bit of a clever clogs, aren't you?

Yes.

All right, my little explorers. Are you ready for the next bit of adventure?

Yes, Grampy Rabbit.

We have to find an egg.

An egg?

But eggs are little. It could be anywhere.

Leave it to me. Foxes love hunting for eggs.

Freddy Fox has a very good sense of smell.

Wow! What an egg!

It's huge!

Why is the egg so big?

It's a dinosaur egg.

Is it real?

No, it's better than real. It's pretend. Watch this!

Happy birthday! Happy birthday!

The dinosaur egg has a birthday cake inside it.

Hooray!

It is not a pretend cake, is it, Grampy Rabbit?

No, the cake is very real and very tasty. Who wants some?

Me! Me!

Birthday boy first! Here you go, Freddy.

Happy birthday, Freddy.

Time for a bit song and dance. Everyone, copy me.

Do the stomp. Do the dinosaur stomp! Do



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Bedtime Story



the roar! Do the dinosaur roar! Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!

Roar! Roar! Roar! Do the dinosaur stomp! Stomp! Roar!

This is my best birthday ever.



It is night time. Daddy Pig is reading Peppa and George a bedtime story.

And so the prince, the princess, the budgie and the frog all lived happily ever after. The end!

The bedtime story has sent Peppa and George to sleep.

Good night, my little piggies!

George's awake.

Dinosaur! Grrr...

George, you naughty piggy! Go back to sleep.

George is not sleepy.

George! Night time is for sleeping, not playing! I can tell you a bedtime story.

Once upon a time, there was a little pig. His name was Georgie Pig. And he was off to make his fortune. Soon, he came to a forest.

Do you like the story, George?

Inside the forest was a little house. And inside the house was a bowl of porridge. Georgie Pig was very hungry. So he ate it all up. Yum, yum, yum!

But just as he finished, Baby Bear walked in, and said, "Oy, did you eat my magic porridge?"

Georgie said, "Yes!" Baby Bear said, "That was magic porridge. It will make you go very big."

And then Georgie Pig began to grow. He grew and he grew and he grew until he was taller than all of the trees in the forest.

The end. Are you sleepy, George?

No.

Not even a little bit?



No!

OK, I'll do a bit more story.

Baby Bear said, "There is a box of golden treasure at the end of the world. But it's too far for me to go because I am too little."

Georgie said, "I will carry you there."

So Georgie Pig walked to the end of the world. He walked and he walked and he walked. Are you sleepy yet?

No.

He walked through forests, then across mountains, across seas. And are you sleepy yet?

No!

He walked all the way to the end of the world and found a big box of golden treasure.

Ooh!

And a big dragon!

Grrr!

Yes! A big green dragon, with little wings, and breathing fire. Roar!

Luckily it was a very friendly dragon. And he said, "You can have the treasure."

But then, Georgie Pig began to shrink. He shrank and he shrinked and he shrunk until he was the same little Georgie Pig as he was before.

"How will we get back home now?" said Baby Bear.

"I can fly you home." said the dragon.

So Georgie Pig and Baby Bear hopped on the dragon's back and flew all the way back home to the little house in the forest. And then it's the end.

George is asleep. Peppa is asleep.

Peppa, what are you doing out of bed? Night time is for sleeping, not playing.

Night night, my little piggies. Sweet dreams.

Peppa and George are in their little beds, fast asleep.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Lost Keys




Peppa and her family have been for a lovely day out in the mountains.

Time to go home. Back to the car.

Thank you for visiting the Mountain Beauty Spot. See you again soon.

Key! Key!

No, George. You can't play with the car keys.

You might lose them.

You're playing with the car keys, Daddy.

But I'm a grown-up. I'm not going to lose them.

Oh dear. Daddy Pig has dropped the car keys down a drain.

Oh!

Right! Let's go home.

Um... that might be difficult.

Why?

Daddy dropped the car keys down the drain.

Oh, Daddy Pig!

Don't worry. I'll get the car keys out of the drain with a stick.

Hooray!

Mmm, the drain must be deeper than I thought.

The stick is not long enough to reach the keys.

What we need is a fishing rod. Then we can catch the keys on a hook.

Maybe Miss Rabbit sells fishing rods.

Um, do you sell fishing rods?

We do, actually. I don't know why. You don't get fish in the mountains.

We are not fishing for fish. We are fishing for keys.


My Daddy dropped the car keys down the drain.

Oh, you'll never get those back. That drain's really deep.

What are drains for?

A drain takes the rain water away to the sea.

The fishing line is not long enough to reach the keys.

My goodness! How deep is this drain?

We can see how deep it is by dropping a stone.

Good idea, Miss Rabbit. We can count how long the stone takes to reach the bottom.

One, two, three, four, five, six.

That is deep!

Told you!

What can we do now?

It is Mr Bull and his friends.

Digger! Crane!

George loves diggers and cranes.

Hello, everybody.

Hello, Mr Bull. Welcome to the Mountain Beauty Spot.

Have you come to do some work?

No, it's our day off. So we came to enjoy the Beauty Spot.

You can see for miles, boss.

Yes, it's very pretty.

Ur... Mr Bull, could we borrow your crane for a minute?

What for?

My Daddy dropped the car keys down the drain.

Say no more. I'll have 'em out in no time. Mr Rhino, the crane, please.

Stand clear. Down she goes!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. George's New Dinosaur



How lucky Mr Bull came along when he did!

Yes, now we'll finally get our keys back.

That's as far as she goes, chief.

Mr Bull is the chief.

Did you find our keys?

No. The crane isn't long enough.

Now, what shall we do?

Easy! We'll dig up the road.

Hooray!

Mr Bull is digging up the beauty spot.

Stop!

What's going on?

We came to see the Beauty Spot.

Um... they're digging it up now. Won't be long.

My Daddy dropped the car keys down the drain.

Oh!

Hold it! Hold it! It's the keys. We've got them.

Hooray!

There you go!

Thank you, Mr Bull.

Oh, it was nothing.

Er... where's the beauty spot gone?

The Mountain Beauty Spot is now a big hole.

It's a cave now. Welcome to the Cave Beauty Spot.

Ooh!

All thanks to my daddy!

Err... and Mr Bull.

Yes, I'm good at digging holes.

Mr Bull loves digging holes. Everybody loves digging holes.



George is playing with his favourite toy, Mr Dinosaur. George loves playing with Mr Dinosaur.

Mr Dinosaur is made of plastic. It is almost impossible to break him.

Dinosaur! Grr...

George loves playing with Mr Dinosaur in the bath.

At night time, George always takes Mr Dinosaur to bed with him.

Dinosaur! Grr...

George, Mr Dinosaur is broken.

Oh.

Mr Dinosaur does not have a tail anymore.

Poor George.

You have had Mr Dinosaur a long time.

I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did.

Maybe it's about time you got a new dinosaur.

Yes, we can go to Mr Fox's shop tomorrow.

This is Mr Fox's shop.

Mr Fox's shop sells everything.

I'm sure we'll find you a lovely new dinosaur here, George.

Dinosaur!

George does not want a new dinosaur.

Look, George. A big dinosaur.

Oh! Dinosaur!

Good morning! Can I help you?

We'd like the dinosaur at the window, please.

Certainly!

Good choice. This is the Dino Roar. It roars, it




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grandpa Pig's Train to the Rescue



walks, and it sings a dinosaur song.

Dino Roar! Dino Roar! Listen to the Dino Roar!

Roar!

Wow!

Dino Roar!

We'll take it.

Roar!

George is playing with Dino Roar in the garden.

Don't play too roughly with Dino Roar, George.

He has moving parts and might get broken.

George cannot play with Dino Roar in the garden.

George wants to play with Dino Roar in the bath.

George, if you get Dino Roar wet, he'll stop working.

George cannot play with Dino Roar in the bath.

It is night time. George has taken Dino Roar to bed with him.

Roar!

Ah!

George! Dino Roar has woken me up.

Maybe Dino Roar should sleep somewhere else.

George cannot have Dino Roar in his bed at night.

It is morning.

Why is George looking so sad?

George cannot play with Dino Roar in the garden, in the bath, or in bed.

Never mind, George. Dino Roar can still roar.

Dino Roar! Dino Roar! Listen to the Dino Roar!

Roar!

Oh!

I think the batteries must run out, Daddy Pig.


Already? How many batteries are in here?

Hundreds and thousands.

Dino Roar needs lots of batteries to make him roar.

Oh, what's this? A trumpet? It doesn't work.

Dinosaur!

That's not a trumpet, Peppa. You found Mr Dinosaur's tail.

Oh!

Now, Daddy Pig can mend him.

I'll try. Mmm... I think it might be quite difficult to mend. Oh.

Daddy Pig has mended Mr Dinosaur.

Hooray!

Ho ho, I'm a bit of an expert at mending things.

George loves Mr Dinosaur.

Dinosaur! Grr...

Dinosaur! Dinosaur! Hello Mr Dinosaur!

Grr...

Mr Dinosaur is George's favourite toy in the whole world.



Grandpa Pig is taking Peppa and George for a ride on his little train, Gertrude.

I love Gertrude the train.

And the good thing is, Gertrude has rubber wheels, so we don't have to go on train tracks.

We can go wherever we like.

Grandpa's little train goes toot toot toot, toot toot toot, toot toot toot. Grandpa's little train goes toot toot toot, all day long.

Miss Rabbit is taking the grown-ups to work in her big train.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grandpa Pig's Train to the Rescue



Morning Grandpa Pig. Out on your toy train again.

Gertrude is not a toy. She's a miniature locomotive.

Oh, that's nice. Bye.

Go faster, Grandpa Pig.

I can't! This is as fast as Gertrude goes.

The big train is going very fast. Oh dear! The big train has broken down.

What's happening? We need to get to work.

Hello, Miss Rabbit. Having trouble with your train?

It's not funny, Grandpa Pig. All of my passengers need to get to work.

You need to get yourself a train that doesn't break down, like Gertrude.

That's a good idea. Out you get.

What?

I'm borrowing your train.

All change.

What am I going to do?

You can stay here and mend the big train.

Righto! I do like mending things.

Ooh, what fun! Riding a toy train.

Gertrude is not a toy. She's a miniature locomotive.

Of course! All aboard the toy train.

Can't it go any faster?

No, Gertrude is a slow train.

Mrs Cow is waiting for the train at the next station.

What's happened to the big train? Has it shrunk?

No, this is a toy train.


Gertrude is not a toy train. She's a miniature locomotive.

Off we go!

Grandpa Pig loves mending things.

So many interesting bits and bobs.

Oh, dear! A traffic jam.

Gertrude can ride on the grass.

Of course!

Bye everyone.

Miss Rabbit is taking a shortcut. Pass the duck pond.

Hello, ducks.

Up the hill.

Hello, Gertrude. You can make it.

And to the next station.

Hello! Where's the big train?

The big train is broken. We're riding Grandpa Pig's toy train today.

Gertrude is not a toy train.

She's a miniature locomotive.

Next stop! The end of the line.

This goes here! And that goes there!

Grandpa Pig has mended the train.

Good as new.

Last stop! Now you can all do your important work.

Hang on! It's taken so long to get here. It's home time.

Oh, back we go then.

But if we travel on Gertrude, it'll take ages to get home.

Hello, everyone. I've mended the big train.

Excellent, Grandpa Pig. All change.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Pet Competition



Off we go.

Stop! What about Gertrude? We can't leave her behind.

Yes, Gertrude!

Don't worry! We can take the toy train as well.

Gertrude is not a toy.

We know! She's a miniature locomotive.

Gertrude is the best train in the whole wide world.



Peppa and her friends are at playgroup.

Children, tomorrow we will have a pet competition.

Ooh!

Bring your pets to school. The best pet will win a prize.

I'm going to bring my pet goldfish.

I'm going to bring my stick insect.

I will bring my gecko.

I'm going to bring Monkey. Ooh! Ooh!

That's not a real pet. It's a doll.

It's not a doll. It's Monkey. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! He likes you, Danny.

Zoe can bring Monkey if she wants to.

Home time, children. Don't forget your pets for the competition tomorrow.

It is the evening before the pet competition.

Peppa and Suzy are getting Goldie the fish ready.

Eat up, Goldie. You've got a big day tomorrow.

I will polish your bowl. Ha! Ha!

Lovely.

Pedro is talking to his stick insect. A stick insect



is an insect that looks like a stick.

Tomorrow you will come with me to playgroup.

They will decide who is the best pet. And it will be you.

Edmond Elephant is talking to his gecko.

Watch me! Brrr! Now, you do it.

Brrr!

Ha! Ha! Ha!

Zoe Zebra is talking to her monkey.

Are you excited about the competition, Monkey? Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Remember to be good tomorrow. Don't be a cheeky monkey.

It is the day of the pet competition.

Madame Gazelle, who is going to decide which pet is the best?

Doctor Hamster!

Hello, everyone.

Hello.

Ah! What lovely pets you've got! That's a happy little fish. What's its name?

It's Goldie. You've met her before.

She's got a very shiny bowl. What is Goldie like doing?

She likes swimming around and going like this.

Wonderful! And who is this?

This is my stick insect.

What's his name?

Steven.

What does he do?

He looks like a stick.

Amazing! Oh! What kind of animal is this?

It is a gecko.

Does he have a name?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Spider Web



Hemidactylus frenatus.

Edmond Elephant is a clever clogs.

Right! And what does he do?

This! Brrr!

Brrr!

Oh! Who's next?

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Monkey!

Is he meant to be upside down?

Yes, he's asleep.

Ah, I see. Well, it's lovely. I've brought my pet too, Tiddles the tortoise. He likes climbing trees and...

Who is the winner?

Yes, who's won the prize?

Now, the prize goes to... Tiddles the tortoise!

Doctor Hamster has picked her own pet to win the prize.

That's not fair.

It's your own pet.

Oh, no! This is only the prize for the best tortoise.

The prize for the best fish goes to Goldie the fish!

Hooray!

The prize for the best gecko goes to the gecko.

Hooray!

The prize for the pet who looks most like a stick goes to Steven.

Hooray!

The prize for the best monkey...

Doctor Hamster, he's not a real monkey. He's just pretend.


The prize for the best pretend monkey goes to Monkey.

Hooray!

But Doctor Hamster, which is the best pet of all?

All of them. They're all happy healthy pets. They're lovely.



Daddy Pig is hard at work in the study.

Daddy Pig, this study is a complete mess.

It's not that bad.

There are lots of cobwebs.

I love cobwebs. They give the room character.

Cobwebs mean spiders and I don't like spiders.

I do. Spiders catch flies and flies are horrid.

Well, as long as I don't have to see a spider. Ah!

A spider! Hello, Mr Skinny Legs! Oh! Where have you gone?

Find it. I don't want it in the house.

Everyone is looking for Mr Skinny Legs.

Mr Skinny Legs is not in the filing cabinet.

Oh!

Mr Skinny Legs is not under the chair.

Oh!

Mr Skinny Legs is not on the table.

Oh! I wonder where Mr Skinny Legs is.

Ah!

Ho ho! It sounds like Mummy has found him.

Don't be scared, Mummy.

Get rid of it.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Spider Web



OK, we'll take Mr Skinny Legs into the garden.

Now, Mr Skinny Legs has got the whole garden to play.

Bye bye, Mr Skinny Legs!

It is starting to rain. Mr Skinny Legs is running back to the house.

Maybe he doesn't like the rain.

He's climbing up the water spout.

Eensey Weensey spider climbed up the water spout. Down came the rain and washed poor Weensey out. Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain. Eensey Weensey spider climbed up the spout again.

I don't want Mr Skinny Legs in the house, Daddy Pig.

Let's take Mr Skinny Legs a bit further into the garden.

There we are! A nice tree for you to live in.

What is he doing?

He's making a web, Peppa. Spiders live in webs and use them to catch flies.

Oh, he's very busy.

Yes. It's hard work, building a web. That's why you must never ever break one. If you do, the spider has to do all the work again.

Yes, Daddy. Bye bye, Mr Skinny Legs.

It is bed time.

I liked watching Mr Skinny Legs making his web today.

And tomorrow, he will make another web.

Really?

Yes, Mr Skinny Legs makes a new web every day.

Where will the new web be, Daddy?

I don't know. We'll find out tomorrow. Good night!

Night night.



It is morning. Daddy Pig is getting ready to go to work.

I don't want to be late. I have an important meeting at the office.

Daddy, you work very hard.

Yes, I do. But not as hard as Mr Skinny Legs.

Bye bye everyone. See you tonight.

Stop, Daddy!

What is it?

You cannot drive the car today.

Why not?

Look!

Mr Skinny Legs has built a web, joining the car to the house.

Daddy, you said "you must never ever break a web."

Did I?

Yes, Daddy Pig.

If you move the car, you will break the web.

But how am I going to get to work?

Don't worry, Daddy. You can borrow my little bicycle. Here you are!

Thank you, Peppa.

Daddy Pig is riding Peppa's little bicycle.

Have a nice ride to work!

I will, Peppa. Bye!

Bye!

Oof!

Daddy Pig works very hard.

Oof!

But Mr Skinny Legs works even harder.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Noisy Night




Peppa's family are having a sleepover at Cousin Chloe's house.

Hello, everyone.

Peppa's Family: Hello.

You must be tired after a long journey.

Yes. An early night would be nice.

First, we'll put baby Alexander to bed. This is baby Alexander's bedroom.

Alexander likes noise. It sends him to sleep.

We like noise in this house.

We're a noisy family.

Peppa, George, you're staying in my room tonight.

Oh, goodie.

Peppa and George are excited to be sleeping in Cousin Chloe's bedroom.

Good night!

Good night!

Good night!

Good night!

Good night!

Night night.

Everyone is tucked up in their beds, asleep.

Baby Alexander is awake. Peppa and George are awake.

What's that noise?

It's the vacuum cleaner.

Um... why are you vacuuming at night?

We are not disturbing you, are we?

What? Oh, no!

We found noise is the best way to get baby Alexander back to sleep. He likes noise.


We're a noisy family.

Everyone is back in their beds, asleep.

Baby Alexander is awake.

Why is Aunty Pig playing a trumpet?

To get Alexander to sleep. The more noise, the better.

Is there another way that doesn't use noise?

We do find noise is the best way.

When George was a baby, we used to put him in his pram and wheel him around the house.

And that always sent him to sleep.

How strange!

No loud noises?

That's right. How many times around the house was it, Mummy pig? Three times?

Fifty times.

Daddy Pig is pushing baby Alexander around the house, fifty times.

Good, baby Alexander is asleep. Can you let me back in?

I'll just switch the alarm off.

Switch the alarm back on.

Peppa, what are you doing up?

I can't sleep, Daddy. It's a noisy night.

OK, Peppa. Let's get you back to bed.

Now, which bedroom are you staying in?

Stop, Daddy. That's baby Alexander's room.

Ah!

The light has woken baby Alexander.

That's all right. I've got the vacuum cleaner.

I've got the trumpet.

Stop! Stop! I remember another quiet way we used to get George to sleep.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Wishing Well



Oh, yes. We drove him around in the car. I'll get the car started.

Don't forget the alarm!

Daddy Pig has set off the noisy house alarm. The noisy house has woken everyone up.

It's Miss Rabbit in her rescue helicopter.

Is everybody all right down there? I heard the alarm.

Yes, thank you.

Alright! Cheerio!

Aw, all that loud noise has sent baby Alexander to sleep.

He's really fast asleep now.

All thanks to my noisy daddy.

Well done, Daddy Pig. We should have you to stay more often.



Grandpa Pig is showing Peppa and George around his garden.

Here are my cabbages, broccoli, and sprouts.

Ooh!

Potatoes, carrots and beetroots live here.

And over there is the fruit.

What is this, Grandpa?

That, Peppa, is a weed.

What is a weed?

A weed is a cheeky plant growing in the wrong spot.

Oh!

Pull it out and throw it in this bucket. There's no room for weeds in my tidy garden.

Grandpa Pig is very proud of his garden.

Maybe there's room to grow a little strawberry


here.

In the middle of my carrots? No, Peppa. Strawberries belong with the fruit. Everything has its place. Isn't that right, Granny Pig?

Yes, Grandpa. Can we find a little place for this?

Uh... no!

What is it, Granny?

It's a plastic gnome, Peppa. And he's going to live in our garden.

Oh, no, he isn't. There's no room.

There's plenty of room. What about here?

I can't have that ugly thing looking at me all day!

Peppa, George, do you think my gnome looks ugly?

No, Granny. I think he looks cute.

There, Grandpa. You are outnumbered. The gnome stays. Ah! And here come the rest of them.

What?

Mr Bull is bringing Mr Gnome a truckload of new friends.

Yippee!

But gardens are for plants, not plastic.

Moo! Where do you want the gnomes?

We don't want gnomes, thank you!

Oh!

Goodbye.

Naughty Grandpa Pig. Those are Granny Pig's gnomes.

Oh. It appears we do want gnomes.

Okey-dokey!

They are lovely.

Here is this as well. Cheerio!



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mr Potato's Christmas Show



Thanks you, Mr Bull. Goodbye.

Bye bye.

What's this? A giant gnome?

No, Grandpa. It's a well.

What is a well?

A well, Peppa, is a very deep hole with water in it.

Ooh!

And as it happens, I do need water for my garden. So a well will be useful. But that is not a well. It's made of plastic and there's no hole.

It's beautiful.

What's the point of a well without water?

It's a wishing well. You throw a coin into it and make a wish.

Can I make a wish, Granny?

Of course, Peppa. Here's a little coin.

I wish! I wish! I wish!

Oh, don't tell us what you are wishing for. OK.

Finished!

Very good.

Granny, do the wishes always come true?

Yes.

Oh, goodie!

But now it's time for grandpa to take you home.

Bye bye, Granny.

Bye bye.

Goodbye, my little ones.

Grandpa, you are very lucky having a wishing well in your garden.

Do you think so, Peppa?

Yes, you can wish for things whenever you want.


Hmm...

And the wishes always come true because Granny Pig said so.

Yes.

Do you want to know what I wished for, Grandpa?

What did you wish for, Peppa?

I wished that I could have a wishing well and gnomes in my garden.

Oh, well, I think we can do that.

Peppa and George have arrived home.

Mummy, Daddy, I made a wish. And it came true.

Really? What did you wish for, Peppa?

Lots of gnomes and a wishing well for our garden.

Oh!

Uh... Grandpa Pig, I don't think we have enough room.

Nonsense! You've got plenty of room.

Uh... yes! I suppose so!

Peppa and George love gnomes and wishing wells. Everybody loves gnomes and wishing wells.


It is Christmas time, and Peppa and her playgroup are going to the theatre to see Mr Potato's Christmas Show.

We are here!

Look! It's the Christmas vegetable family.

Mr Potato!

Mrs Carrot!

Sweet Cranberry and Little Sprout.

Here are your tickets. Find the seat with your number on it.

Here's my seat. Number Five.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mr Potato's Christmas Show



Six!

Seven!

Eight!

Nine!

Ten!

Quickly now, children! The show is about to begin.

Um... Madame Gazelle, I need the toilet.

Oh, Pedro!

Sorry! Uh, sorry! Thank you!

Quickly, Pedro!

I've never been to the theatre before.

It's exciting, isn't it?

Sorry! Uh, thank you!

Shhhh, children, everyone quiet now.

What's that music?

The show is starting.

Oh, sorry everyone.

It is not the start of the show. It is Madame Gazelle's phone ringing.

Wow! Whose phone is that?

That really is the show starting!

Welcome to the Mr Potato's Christmas Show, where the magic of vegetables never ends.

Ooh!

Hello, children! I'm Mr Potato. This is Mrs Carrot. Here is Sweet Cranberry. And here is everyone's favourite Christmas vegetable, Little Sprout.

Where is Little Sprout gone?

Little Sprout, where are you?

He's lost!

Oh!


Can you help us find him, boys and girls?

Yes!

If you see him, boys and girls, shout out "There's Little Sprout!"

There's Little Sprout!

That's it! When you see him, shout like that!

There he is! He is behind you!

Where?

There! Behind you!

I can't see him.

They are not very good at looking, are they?

Boo!

There you are! You cheeky little sprout!

I'm the magic Fairy Carrot. Look, children. I can fly.

There's a string lifting her up.

I can grant you one wish. What do you wish for?

I wish we had a Christmas tree!

Your wish is my command!

Ooh!

Now, we can sing our Christmas song. Would you like to hear it, boys and girls?

Yes!

Sweet Little Sprout's on the Christmas tree. Potatoes, carrots and cranberry!

It's a very special Christmas with all our friends, where the magic of vegetables never ends.

That's the end. Goodbye children. Happy Christmas!

Happy Christmas everybody!

That was a bit quick.

Wait, there's one more surprise.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Madame Gazelle's Leaving Party



A very important person has come to see you all.

Ho! Ho! Ho!

Can you guess who it is?

Ho! Ho! Ho!

It's the Queen!

It's Father Christmas!

Hooray!

Hello, children! Have you all been good?

Yes!

Have you all been cleaning your teeth?

Yes!

Have you kept your bedrooms tidy?

Uh...

Jolly good! Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! Now, let's all sing a Christmas song!

Yes!

Sweet Little Sprout's on the Christmas tree. Potatoes, carrots and cranberry! It's a very special Christmas with all our friends, where the magic of vegetables never ends.


It is home time at Peppa's playgroup.

Children, next week, there won't be any playgroup.

Why, Madame Gazelle?

I am going away.

Oh!

Goodbye, children.

Goodbye, Madame Gazelle.

Peppa and George are home from playgroup.

Mummy, there is no more playgroup.


No more playgroup?

Madame Gazelle is going away.

I suppose she has been teaching a long time.

Madame Gazelle taught all the mummies and daddies when they were children.

Madame Gazelle taught me everything I know.

Who can count to three?

One! Two! Three! Hee! Hee! Hee!

Thinking about it, Madame Gazelle must be very old.

Which is probably why she decided to stop teaching.

I know! We should give Madame Gazelle a leaving party.

That sounds fun.

It is the day of Madame Gazelle's leaving party.

Everyone has come to help.

Pedro, you stay outside and tell us if Madame Gazelle's coming along.

Why?

We don't want Madame Gazelle catching us getting her party ready.

Or it wouldn't be a surprise!

OK!

I hope we've invited everyone.

What about Madame Gazelle's old friends?

Wasn't she once in a pop group?

That's right! She played guitar! With that Rocking Gazelles.

Hello, Rocking Gazelles.

Hello, Madame Gazelle is leaving the playgroup.

Gigi leaving? How sad!

We are having a party.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Madame Gazelle's Leaving Party



A party? What fun! We'll be there!

Good. Everyone's coming. Now, let's make the party food.

This is the playgroup kitchen. Everyone is helping with the party food.

Emily Elephant and Wendy Wolf are decorating cupcakes.

I'll do the icing.

I will sprinkle the hundreds and thousands.

Peppa and George are making jelly.

Wobbly jelly! Wobble, wobble, wobble.

Pedro Pony is outside, keeping guard. Here comes Madame Gazelle.

Madame Gazelle is coming.

We are not ready. Stop her, Pedro.

OK!

Hello, Pedro. You are early for playgroup.

Yes! Don't go inside!

Why not?

It's a nice day out here, isn't it?

Uh, yes, Pedro. Can I go inside now?

Uh, no! It's against the law.

What are you talking about, Pedro?

We're ready.

You can go in now.

Surprise!

For she's a jolly good fellow. For she's a jolly good fellow. For she's a jolly good fellow. And so say all of us.

Hooray!

Here is a present for you! An antique clock.

Ooh!

It's made of solid plastic.


Thank you. But why is there a party for me?

Everyone wanted to thank you for being the best teacher in the world.

So we've made you a leaving party.

Because you are going away forever!

I'm not going away forever.

But you said there was no more playgroup.

Oh, Peppa. All I said was no playgroup next week! I'm going on holiday.

Oh!

I will be teaching for many years to come. Who else could be the teacher?

No one!

I'm very happy. Madame Gazelle is not leaving.

Yes, and I can't think of a better reason for a party.

And every party needs music.

Oh ho. The Rocking Gazelles!

Hello, Gigi. Have you still got your guitar?

Of course! Let's rockety-rock!

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Queen




Peppa and her family are watching television.

And now a special message from the queen.

The queen! The queen!

This is the queen.

Hello to all!

Hello Queen!

Today I have decided to give an award to the hardest working person in the country.

I wonder who that will be.

It certainly won't be you, darling!

The hardest working person in the country is Miss Rabbit.

Ooh!

Miss Rabbit runs the ice-cream stall, the recycling centre, the library.

Shhhh!

She drives the train, the fire engine, flies a rescue helicopter and works the supermarket check-out.

Phew! What a long day!

Surprise!

Ah, what are you all doing here?

Miss Rabbit, I have a very special letter for you.

Open it!

Miss Rabbit, please come to my palace to get a medal for all your hard work. Bring friends. All the best, The Queen.

Ooh!

Miss Rabbit has fainted.

I can't visit the queen. I've got too much work to do.

Relax! No one will be working that day.


The queen has made it a holiday.

Hooray!

It is the day Miss Rabbit visits the queen. Peppa and her friends are going too.

We're off to see the queen. We're off to see the queen.

Ee-ya-ya-dio, we're off to see the queen.

Here we are!

This is the queen's palace.

Hello! Is anybody there?

Look at all the fancy stuff!

Don't touch anything! Oops!

What a big house!

Lots of room for a queen to kick a ball about.

Where is the queen?

Queen? Queen? Where are you?

Hello! Have you seen the queen today?

She's an old lady with a crown on her head.

I am the queen.

Miss Rabbit has fainted again.

Hello, Mrs Queen!

Why aren't you wearing a crown?

I don't wear it much, because it's very heavy.

Are you the boss of all the world?

Not quite.

Do you tell people what to do?

Sometimes.

Can you make teachers disappear?

Oh, so many questions!

The children are very excited to meet you, Your Majesty!

I'm excited to meet all of you! And now, for Miss Rabbit's medal!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Desert Island



Ooh!

This is the queen's award for industry!

Thank you!

Keep up the good work. Three cheers for Miss Rabbit!

Hip hip!

Hooray!

Hip hip!

Hooray!

Hip! Hip! Hip!

Hooray!

Now for the party! To the garden.

You've got a lovely big garden, Your Majesty!

Do you play in it all the time?

I don't have much time for playing. No.

That's sad.

Oh, dear! A muddy puddle! Never mind, we can walk around it.

You can't walk around a muddy puddle!

No?

No! You have to jump in it.

Oh, I see. That does look fun. Here one goes, then.

Stop!

Ah?

If you jump in muddy puddles, you must wear your boots, Your Majesty!

Oh dear! The queen is not wearing her boots.

Whee!

The queen loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles. Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.



Peppa and George are at Danny Dog's house.

Captain Dog is telling stories of when he was a sailor.

I sailed all around the world, and then I came home again.

Ooh!

But now I'm back for good, I'll never get on a boat again.

Daddy, do you miss the sea?

Well, sometimes.

It is Granddad Dog, Grandpa Pig and Grampy Rabbit.

Hello!

Can Captain Dog come out to play?

What?

We're going on our fishing trip.

On a boat.

On the sea.

OK. Let's go.

But Daddy, you said you'd never get on a boat again.

Oh, yes. So I did.

OK, bye-bye.

Bye. Well, there they go, off, on a boat, without me.

What are you going to do now, Daddy?

Oh, I don't know. Maybe I'll clean the seaweed off the house.

We don't get seaweed on houses.

No, of course not.

We'll take my boat.

Are you sure your boat's safe, Grampy Rabbit?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Desert Island



Of course it's safe. I built it myself.

Oh, we don't need that bit. Off we go.

I love going fishing.

Me too.

And what do you need for a fishing trip?

Fishing rods?

No, the picnic basket.

It's very good of you to steer the boat, Grampy Rabbit.

But I'm not steering the boat. I thought somebody else was.

Oh, dear. No one is steering the boat.

We're lost at sea.

And look, Grampy Rabbit's boat is sinking.

Don't panic! I've been in worse situations than this.

Really?

No, this is the worst.

We are saved.

But we're stuck on a desert island.

With just the sea and the sky for company.

And we haven't got any food.

I've got a chocolate bar.

Good, we should save the chocolate in case we get hungry later.

Oh, dear. Grampy Rabbit has eaten all the food.

What a terrible place to be stuck. Is anyone else missing cheese?

We've only been here five minutes, Grampy Rabbit.

I'm going to put a mark in the sand for every time I think about cheese.


We need to call for help.

Call for help! What an excellent idea!

Help...!

Grampy Rabbit is very good at shouting.

What was that?

That was the call of the sea. Someone is in trouble.

What can we do?

We'll rescue them.

We can use Granddad Dog's boat. Wait a minute. I said I'd never get on a boat again.

But Daddy, they need rescuing.

You're right, just this once. I shall sail again.

Life jackets on.

Aye aye, Captain Dog.

Full sail!

All our food is gone. There's nothing left to eat.

There must be something to eat.

Ahoy, there!

Hooray! We're saved.

Captain Dog has rescued the granddads.

Land ahoy! Everyone off the boat. Farewell, everybody. See you in a few weeks.

Daddy, where are you going?

Me? I was just thinking of sailing around the world again.

But Daddy, you're not a sailor anymore.

No, of course not.

Leave the sailing to us, Captain Dog.

Yes! And when they get lost again, you can rescue them.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Perfume




Peppa and George are visiting Granny and Grandpa's house. Peppa is watching Granny Pig at her dressing table.

You smell nice, Granny.

Thank you, Peppa. It's my perfume de lavender.

It smells like your garden.

That is because perfume is made of flowers.

Granny, I've got a very good idea.

Really?

Yes. First, I need some water.

Here's your water.

Right. Now I'm going to put flowers in it and make perfume.

That's nice, dear. But only pick flowers from the grass, not from the flower bed, okay?

OK.

Hello, flowers. Who wants to be in my perfume? I'm going to put you in my beaker of water.

Hello, butterfly. I'm making perfume. It's going to be the prettiest, smelliest perfume, ever. Lovely.

Here is George.

Stand back, George. I'm making perfume. Do you want to watch?

First I pick a smelly flower. Very flowery. Then I put it in my beaker.

No, George. You can't put grass in my perfume. It needs the smell of flowers. Smell.

Yuk!

George does not like smelly flowers.

Grandpa Pig is in his herb garden.

Grandpa, Grandpa, smell this.


Pooey! It smells like pond water.

It's my special perfume. I made it with flowers from the garden.

Oh, yes. It's the most beautiful perfume in the world.

Yes.

Do you like it, George?

No.

George doesn't like the smell of flowers.

Take this bucket, George. You can make perfume out of something else.

I have got lots of lovely smelly things in my herb garden. This is rosemary. I like to use it in my cooking.

Mmm, it smells interesting.

This is mint.

Oh, that smells very minty.

And this is lavender.

Oh, that smells like Granny Pig's perfume.

Wow, that's a strong smell of lavender. Ah, Granny Pig, you smell nice.

Thank you, Grandpa Pig.

Granny, Granny, smell this.

What is it?

It's my perfume.

Oh, yes. It's lovely. Has George made some perfume, too?

No, Granny. He doesn't like the smell of anything.

There must be something you like to smell of.

George has found a muddy puddle.

Ah, George. What have you got there?

Have you made some perfume? Actually, that smells quite nice.

It smells lovely.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Children's Fete



I say, that is delightful. What did you put in it, George?

George's perfume is made out of muddy puddles.

Ah, perfume de muddy puddle.

Whee!

Granny Pig, you smell even nicer than you did before.

Yes, you should use perfume de muddy puddle more often.

Ha ha ha ha ha ha!


The Children's Fete

Peppa and her friends are at playgroup. Mr Bull is checking the school roof.

Moo. Who put this roof on for you?

Uh, you did, Mr Bull.

Lovely job. It will last you a lifetime.

But it is leaking water. Look. It is going drippity-drip.

You need a new roof.

Oh dear, where are we going to get the money for a new school roof?

We can do the school fete to get the money.

Good idea, Danny. But who would run it?

We can.

Yes, the children can do it.

I can do the face painting.

I can do the microphone.

We can have a mummies and daddies' race.

And I can sell balloons.

Yes. We will have a children's fete.

Hooray!


It is the day of children's fete. All the grown-ups are here.

Hello, grown-ups.

Danny Dog is in charge of the microphone.

Get your money out for the new school roof.

Emily Elephant is in charge of bric-a-brac store.

Roll up, roll up! All sorts of bits and bobs!

What a lot of bric-a-brac, Emily. You will be busy all day selling it.

Here is Mr Fox.

Mmm, this all looks very interesting.

Balloons, lovely balloons! Would you like a balloon, Madame Gazelle?

May I have a red one? How much is it?

How much have you got?

Oh, of course. We are rasising money for the school roof.

Look, Madame Gazelle, I have got rid of everything!

Wonderful, Emily. How much money have you raised?

Money?

Did you not get some money for the bits and bobs?

I didn't need to. Mr Fox took it away for nothing.

Get your face painted here.

Suzy Sheep is in charge of the face-panting stall.

Hello, Suzy. Can I be a mountain leopard, please?

No. I can only do fruit.

OK. Can I be...

A plum! There!

Peppa is in charge of the lucky dip.

Roll up, roll up, be your lucky dip.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Aquarium



Moo! Hello, Peppa.

Hello, Mr Bull. You've got a green face.

I'm an apple.

Would you like to try the lucky dip?

OK, what do I do?

Just pull a prize out of the barrel. Everyone a winner.

Mr Bull has won a dolly.

Can I have a go?

Mrs Cat has won a digger.

Oh, do you want to swap?

No, thank you.

Mr Bull and Mrs Cat like their lucky-dip prizes.

Roll up, roll up!

Freddy Fox is in charge of the mummies and daddies' race.

Thank you. It's all to raise money for a new school roof.

I am quite good at running.

It's not running, Daddy. It's a sack race.

Oh.

You have to get in the bag, and jump over there as fast as you can.

Right.

On your marks, get set, go!

And they've fallen down.

Oh!

And they're back up again.

Hooray!

Come on, daddy, mummy.

Keep going, Daddy!

And my mummy is the winner!


Hooray!

That was fun, wasn't it?

Yes, lots of fun.

But really we must thank the children for all their hard work.

Thank you, children.

And we have raised enough money to buy a new school roof... again.

Hooray!



Peppa is feeding Goldie the fish.

Dinner time, Goldie. Oh, Goldie isn't eating.

She looks a bit sad.

I think she is lonely. She hasn't got any fish friends.

Maybe Goldie could visit the aquarium.

What's the aquarium?

The aquarium is a place where there are lots of fish.

Shall we go to the aquarium, Goldie?

That means yes!

The family have brought Goldie the fish to the aquarium.

I hope we can find Goldie a friend.

I'm sure we will, Peppa. The aquarium has every type of fish.

Hello, Miss Rabbit.

Hello. How many tickets, please?

Two grown-ups and two children.

And one fish, please.

The fish goes free.

Does the aquarium have every type of fish?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Aquarium



Oh, yes! Probably.

Good! We're looking for a friend for Goldie.

Well, I hope you find one. Enjoy the aquarium.

Thank you!

The first room has a tank full of little fish.

Fishy!

Wow! There are millions of teeny fish.

Fishy fishy fish fish, swimming in the sea. Who will be a fishy friend for my fish Goldie?

Ho! Ho! Ho!

Could any of these be Goldie's friend?

Mmm, no! They are too small.

Let's see what fish are in the next room.

OK!

Here is Candy Cat and her family.

Hello, Candy.

Hello, Peppa.

What are you doing here?

We come here all the time.

It's better than watching TV.

We like fish.

We've come to find a friend for Goldie the fish.

Candy's Family: Oh!

What's in this tank?

I can't see anything.

Oh ho! Daddy Pig, there's a fish right in front of you.

Where? Whoa!

It is a very big fish.

Wow!

Do you think this fish could be a friend for


Goldie?

No! It is too big!

Never mind. Let's go to the next room.

What's in this tank?

Dinosaur! Grrr...

George thinks he has seen a dinosaur.

It's not a dinosaur, George. It's a funny kind of fish, called a seahorse.

You know lots about fish?

Yes! I like fish.

Can the seahorse be Goldie's friend?

Uh... no! It's too dinosaury!

One more room to go!

Oh, what's in this tank?

Nothing! It's just green slime. Urgh!

That green slime is algae.

There must be some sort of fish in here! Whoa! There's a fish with big long ears. It's a rabbit fish.

It is Miss Rabbit, wearing a diving costume.

Ooh!

She's cleaning the fish tank. Miss Rabbit is saying hello. It is difficult to talk under water.

Hello, Miss Rabbit.

That was the last fish tank.

Oh, we haven't found a friend for Goldie.

What's in the next room?

This is the aquarium caf.

Oh, goody! My favourite room.

Hello, Peppa. Did you find a friend for Goldie?

No! Oh, who's that?

That's just Ginger, my pet goldfish. He loves



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. George's Racing Car



the aquarium.

Ho! Ho! It looks like Goldie's found a friend after all.

Goldie isn't lonely anymore.

Hooray!

And Goldie can visit Ginger any time she wants.


George's Racing Car

It is a lovely sunny day at Granny and Grandpa Pigs' house. Peppa, George, Daddy and Grandpa are inside, watching racing cars on television.

Come on, Car No. .

It's neck and neck coming up to the finish.

What a lot of noise!

This is so exciting. Car No.  is the fast...

Ah!

That's better.

The race was almost finished. Switch it back on!

Wow! That was an exciting and rare race. I'm so glad I didn't miss the finish.

See, it's finished. It's such a lovely day. You should all go outside and play.

Yes, Granny Pig.

So, what are we going to play?

George wants to play racing cars.

I know, let's build George a racing car.

Can you really make a racing car, Daddy?

No, but Grandpa Pig can.

What? O-O-OK. I'll make a racing car for George.

This is Grandpa Pig's shed, where he makes things.



What have we got here? Ah, an old pram.

No.

George isn't a baby, Grandpa.

We only need the pram's wheels, Peppa.

Ooh!

This bit can be the bonnet.

And this can be the seats.

What's your favorite number, George?

George's favorite number is two.

Oh! This racing car will be super fast.

Hooray!

Don't make it go too fast, Grandpa. George is only little.

Don't worry, Peppa. This will be a pedal car, not a motor car.

Ah!

Next, we need a steering wheel. Last of all, you need racing goggles and a hat.

It's George's racing car.

Here are Danny Dog, Zoe Zebra, and Pedro Pony.

Hello, everyone. Look at George's racing car.

Vroom!

Wow!

I'll race you.

And me!

And me!

I want to race too.

Where's your racing car, Peppa?

I don't have a racing car.

Don't worry, Peppa. You can be the chief mechanic.

What does that do?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Little Boat



You fix George's car, if it goes wrong.

Oh, goody. I hope it goes wrong a lot.

Let's start the race.

Three times round the garden.

Ready, steady, go!

And they're off.

George's Family: Come on, George.

That's the end of lap one, and George is in the lead.

What's all this noise out here? I'm trying to watch television.

We're having a race, Granny.

That's the end of lap two, and George is still in the lead.

Oh, dear. A wheel has come off George's car.

Where's the chief mechanic?

Here I am.

What do we do?

Put the wheel back on.

OK, chief mechanic.

Go, George, go!

Oh, dear. George is now at the back of the race.

Pedal faster, George.

Come on, George.

Come on, George.

George is the winner.

George's Family: Hooray!

Well done, George. You're the best racing driver in the whole world.

And you've got the best chief mechanic in the whole world, too.

Yes. That's me!



Peppa and her family are going on a picnic.

I love picnics.

Me too.

The picnic spot is on the other side of the river.

Oh, how do we get over there?

We take a little boat. You call it by ringing this bell.

Hello, there!

It is Grampy Rabbit in his rowing boat.

Would you like to cross the river?

Yes, please!

Oh, stop, Daddy Pig. There's no more room.

Oh!

Bye bye, Daddy!

Don't worry. I'll come straight back for you.

Bye.

Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream.

If you see a crocodile, don't

forget to scream.

Ah!

Ha ha ha ha.

Picnic spot. Everybody off.

Thank you, Grampy Rabbit.

Daddy Pig is still waiting to get across the river.

Hello, Mr Pig.

Here are the Wolf family.

What are you doing here?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Little Boat



We're having a picnic. Would you like to join us?

Yes, please, Mr Pig.

Ah. All passengers. Women and children first. Stop! The boat is full.

Oh!

I'll be straight back for you two.

Bye bye.

Row, row, row your boat, gently down the creek.

If you see a big bad wolf, don't forget to shriek.

Ah!

Hello, Peppa!

Hello, Wendy!

We're joining your picnic.

Oh, goody.

But where's Daddy Pig?

I left him with Mr Wolf.

I'm getting a bit hungry.

Don't worry. We've got the picnic.

All aboard. Stop, Mr Wolf. There's not enough room for you.

Oh, dear.

I've got an idea. You wait here, Grampy Rabbit, and we'll go over.

Alright. I could do with the rest.

Mr Wolf and Mr Pig are crossing the river together.

I'm really hungry now.

Hooray! We're here.

Hello, Daddy. Where's the picnic?

Oh.


Grampy Rabbit is waiting with the picnic.

I forgot the picnic.

Ha ha ha! You got on a picnic without a picnic.

You're right there. Ah! What about me, Grampy Rabbit?

No room, Daddy Pig. I'll come back for you.

It is Mrs Duck and her friends.

Hello, Mrs Duck. If you've come for the picnic, you'll have to wait for the little boat, like me. Or you could just swim across, like you're doing.

Here's the picnic hamper, everybody.

Hooray!

And here are the ducks.

The ducks always turn up when we have picnics.

Would you like some cheese, Grampy Rabbit?

Well, I should really be getting back. Oh, I do love a bit of cheese?

I love jelly.

I love sandwiches.

Strawberry!

They've forgotten me!

Here's some cake for you, Mrs Duck. Is cake your favorite? It's Daddy's favorite, too. Oh, where is Daddy?

We forgot Daddy.

Ahoy there! I've come to take you to the picnic.

Hooray!

Daddy Pig!

Oh! We forgot you.

But I saved you some jelly.

I saved you a sandwich.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Sandpit



And George saved you a strawberry.

How nice of you all. Is there any cake?

No, we gave it to the ducks. But look! Mrs Duck has saved you a worm.

Ho ho, thank you, Mrs Duck.

Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream creek. If you see a big bad wolf, don't forget to shriek.


Peppa and her friends are playing in the sandpit.

This sandpit is a desert island. We'll live here forever.

If we're going to live here forever, I want it to be nice.

It just needs some houses.

And roads.

And shops.

Dinosaur!

Grrr!

Yes, George. The desert island can have dinosaurs too.

What are you doing?

We are making a desert island.

It's got houses and roads and shops.

Has it got trees?

No!

It would be nicer if it had trees.

Where are we going to get trees from?

We have to drive big trucks around the world and look for trees.

Dinosaurs, you look after the island, while we go


and look for some trees.

Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

Peppa, Suzy, Danny and Emily are pretending to drive around the world, looking for trees.

Vroom! Vroom!

Hello, Mummy Rabbit. Have you got any spare trees?

Uh...

We need trees for our desert island.

Oh, I see! How many trees would you like?

Enough to make a forest!

There you go!

Thank you!

Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

Grrr!

The dinosaurs are having fun jumping up and down on the desert island.

The dinosaurs have broken everything!

Naughty dinosaurs!

Now we'll have to make it all again.

What are you making?

This is our desert island.

With roads and houses.

And shops.

And trees.

There! We'll live here forever. Again!

It will be really good if it has a lake.

Yes, a lake.

One lake.

But it needs water to be a proper lake.

Oh!

Where are we going to get water from?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Night Animals



We must fly around the world in aeroplanes.

Peppa and her friends are pretending to fly around the world, looking for water.

Pedro Pony is playing on the roundabout.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Pedro. We've got a desert island, with houses.

And roads.

Shops.

Trees.

And a lake.

But we need water for the lake. Have you got some, please?

I don't know what you are talking about.

It just pretend. We're playing a game.

Oh, I see. You want pretend water.

Yes.

Mmm... I know where there's pretend snow. We can melt it to get pretend water.

Where?

On the mountain top.

That's a slide.

It's a pretend mountain. Oh!

What's the matter, Pedro?

Because it is a hot day, the snow has melted.

Can't we pretend it hasn't melted?

No, it's melted good and proper.

Oh!

But look, over there! Real water.

Daddy Pig is drinking from the water fountain.

Water!

Daddy, can we have some water in our bucket,



please?

We're making a lake.

Ho ho! Of course.

We've got water.

Nice water!

It is Freddy Fox.

Hello, everyone. What's this?

It's a desert island. We are going to live here forever.

If only it had a flag.

I've got a flag in my van, if you'd like it.

Mr Fox has got everything in his van.

Uh, we only need a pretend one, Mr Fox.

OK. How about this?

Thank you, Mr Fox.

Now, our desert island is perfect.

We will live here forever. Again!



Peppa and George are having a sleepover at Granny and Grandpa Pigs' house.

Grandpa, where are you going? It's bedtime.

Don't worry, Peppa. I'm just going into the garden to collect slugs and snails.

Why?

Grandpa doesn't like slugs and snails, because they eat his vegetables.

And the best time to find them is at night with this torch.

Can George and me come too? Please!

OK. Just this once.

Put your coats and boots on.

Peppa and George are wearing their coats and



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Night Animals



boots over their pajamas.

You carry the bucket, Peppa. And I'll hold the torch.

Don't stay out too late, Grandpa Pig.

OK, Granny Pig.

We'll put all the slugs and snails in the bucket. Ah! One little snail.

Two little snails. And a slug. Ugh! Slugs are yucky.

Here are Grandpa Pig's chickens: Sara, Gemima, Vanessa and Neville.

Hello, chickens!

I need to put the chickens to bed. Night night, chickens.

Night night, chickens.

Night night.

Why aren't the slugs and snails in bed, Grandpa?

Because they are up all night, eating my vegetables. Some animals eat in the daytime, like my chickens. And some animals eat at night, like... Oh! Mr Fox.

Hello, Grandpa Pig. Putting your chickens to bed, aren't you?

Oh, yes. Nice and cozy in the henhouse.

Jolly good. Well, I'll be on my way. Good night!

Good night!

Now, as I was saying, some animals eat at night, like... Oh! Hello?

Grandpa, there's a little animal in your bucket.

Ha! Ha! Yes, it's a hedgehog. They like to eat slugs and snails.

Hello, hedgehog! Oh, he's rolled into a ball.

Yes, Peppa. He's very shy.

Come out, Mr Hedgehog. Don't be scared.

I like hedgehogs. They are very good at keeping slugs and snails off my lovely lettuce.



Bye bye, hedgehog.

Bye bye.

Are there any more night animals, Grandpa?

Yes, there are moths.

Ooh! They look like butterflies.

Butterflies that come out at night. They like the torchlight. When it goes off, they leave. When the light goes on, they come back.

Can I try?

OK!

Bye bye, moths. Hello, moths. Bye bye, moths.

And if we leave the torch off, we can see another very tiny night animal.

Where?

Look up at the sky.

Is it a shooting star?

No, that is a firefly.

Is it on fire?

No, Peppa. It has a tummy that glows.

Wow!

Are there any big night animals in your garden, Grandpa?

No! Oh, what's that?

It's a big night animal.

Ho! Ho! It's Granny Pig.

There you are!

Granny, Granny, we've been saying hello to all the night animals.

Lovely. But now it's time to say good night to them.

Good night, night animals.

And it's well pass bedtime for you little piggies.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Flying on Holiday



Yes, Granny Pig.

Good night, little ones.

Good night, Granny. Good night, Grandpa.

Night night!



Peppa and George are going on holiday. They are packing their bags.

You can't pack everything.

But we need to take all our toys, Daddy.

Ho! Ho! Just take the important ones.

OK! I'll take Teddy, and George can take...

Dinosaur! Grr...

Mummy Pig is packing a big bag for the holiday.

Wow! That's a lot of stuff, Mummy Pig. Are you sure we need it all?

Yes! It's all very important.

OK!

It is Suzy Sheep.

Hello, Peppa. Do you want to play?

I can't play today, Suzy. I'm going on holiday.

Oh? Where are you going?

I don't know. Somewhere where there's holidays.

That sounds nice.

Oh! Granny and Grandpa! Why are you here?

We're here for Goldie the fish.

We are looking after her while you are on holiday.

Here's Goldie.

Don't feed her too much, Granny.

OK, Peppa.

It is Mr Bull in his taxi. He's taking Peppa and her


family to the airport.

Hello, Daddy Pig. Let me take that bag for you. Wow! Ah! That's heavy. Are you sure you need everything in here?

Yes, it's all very important.

Peppa's Family: Bye!

Bye!

Bye bye!

This is the airport.

Goodbye! Have a lovely holiday.

Tickets, please.

Here they are.

Any bags?

Yes, I'm afraid this one's a bit heavy.

Don't worry! Just pop it on the scales.

Anything valuable in it?

No.

Any more?

Yes.

You can take those little bags on the plane with you. Just join the queue over there.

This is the X-Ray machine.

What's this, Daddy?

It's a machine that looks inside things.

Ooh!

Put your bags on here, please.

Look, it's my bag, with Teddy inside.

Dinosaur! Grr...

That's magic!

This is the aeroplane that will take Peppa and her family on the holiday.

Airplane!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Holiday House



George loves aeroplanes.

Welcome aboard! We hope you enjoy your flight with us today.

Can I sit next to the window?

Ho ho! Of course, Peppa.

Yes, George. You can sit next to the window too.

This is Captain Emergency speaking. Is everybody ready?

Yes, Captain Emergency.

Then let's go.

Whee!

Look, Teddy. We're flying.

What can you see out of the window, Peppa?

It's all cloudy and rainy.

Ooh! Now, it's sunny.

That's because we are on top of the clouds.

The plane is flying higher and higher.

Oh! Are we flying up to the sun?

No! But we are going somewhere sunny.

Flying high in a plane, up above the clouds and rain.

Flying high, sunny sky. Flying high and high and high.

Peppa and her family are flying through the sky, on their way to a sunny holiday.



Peppa and her family are flying to another country for a holiday.

We hope you have enjoyed your flight. Please fasten your seat belts.

This is Captain Emergency speaking.

We are about to land in Italy.

Oh, Italy! That sounds nice.

The aeroplane has landed.



Hooray!

Oh dear! Peppa has left Teddy on the aeroplane.

Now, we need a car to drive to our holiday house.

Here is the place to borrow cars.

Hello.

Buongiorno. Non posso aiutare una cosbella signora.

In Italy, people speak Italian.

Oh, um... we need a car.

Non capisco.

Let me handle this. I'm an expert at talking. We need a car.

Uovo.

Not eggs. A car. Um, no. Not flowers. No.

Broom! Broom!

Auto. Broom! Broom! Beep! Beep!

Well done, George.

He! He!

This bag is heavy. Are you sure we need everything in here, Mummy Pig?

Yes, it's all very important.

Are we going to get lost like you always do?

No, Peppa. The sat-nav will tell us the way.

Sat-nav: Benvenuto al auto del futuro.

In Italy, the sat-nav talks in Italian.

Sat-nav: Proseguire sulla...

Maybe we don't need the sat-nav. Um... let's go this way.

Remember Daddy Pig, this is another country.

They may drive differently here.

Ho! Ho! Driving is driving, Mummy Pig. It can't be that different.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Holiday in the Sun





Driving in Italy is very different to driving at home.

Hello! Yes, we are on a holiday.

Daddy, why are they beeping their horns at us.

I expect they are saying "Hello".

Can we say "Hello" back?

Of course we can.

Hello.



Everyone is so friendly here.

Peppa and her family are on their way to their holiday house.

Ah! We're almost there.

Yes, I can feel myself relaxing already.

Teddy! I left Teddy on the aeroplane.

What?

We have to go back for Teddy.

Uh...

Oh dear! It is a policeman.

Hello, officer. I don't know what I was doing wrong, but I promise I won't do it again.

Good day! I'm returning this young bear. He was left on the aeroplane.

Oh, thank you!

Teddy!

Have a lovely holiday.

Here we are.

Peppa and her family have arrived at their holiday house.

What have you got in this bag, Mummy Pig?

It's all important stuff for our holiday. A lovely plant, our computer, tinned food, hot water bottles,


some winter clothes in case it gets a bit chilly, the telephone.

Let's ring Granny and Grandpa.

Granny and Grandpa Pig are looking after Goldie the fish while Peppa is on holiday.

Are you sure we are feeding Goldie enough?

I'll just feed her a pinch more.

Hello.

Hello, Granny. Can I speak to Goldie, please?

It's Peppa. For you!

I miss you too, Goldie.

It has been a long day. Now it is time for bed.

Good night my little piggies.

Peppa and George are fast asleep in their holiday house.



It is the first morning of Peppa and her family's holiday in Italy.

Ah! Holiday!

Daddy Pig is up, bright and early.

I'll just go for a little walk. Ah!

Good morning, Mr Pig. I see you have found the swimming pool.

This is Signor Goat. It is his job to look after the holiday house.

Daddy fell into water.

It's not funny.

It is quite funny, Daddy.

Ho! Ho! I suppose it is a bit funny.

This is my daughter.

Hello, I'm Gabriella Goat.

I'm Peppa Pig.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Holiday in the Sun



Tell us if you need anything at all.

We'd like to do some sightseeing.

The village is very pretty. I'll show you.

OK. I'll just change out of these wet clothes.

I don't look like a tourist, do I?

You look perfect.

Is everybody ready?

Yes, Daddy Pig.

Then let's go!

This is Gabriella's village.

Here is the shop of my auntie.

Can I send a postcard?

Who is it for?

A goldfish.

A goldfish? Maybe a postcard of the sea.

Yes, Goldie the fish likes water.

Bongo drums, carpets, garden gnomes. Who buys all this rubbish?

Tourists!

Oh! Hello!

Buongiorno.

Mummy Pig is buying lots of things to take home.

Mummy Pig, we haven't got room for this in our suitcase.

Don't worry, Daddy Pig. They sell suitcases too.

This is the village cafe.



My uncle makes very good pizza.

You eat pizza in Italy?

Pizza is Italian food.


Oh, goody. I like pizza.

A little bit of tomato. A little bit of cheese.

Into the oven and...

Into my tummy.

Maybe we let them cook first, now.

OK!

Peppa, let's write the postcard to your gold fish.

Yes, I miss her very much.

To Goldie, Wish you were here.

Loving kisses, Peppa.

You can post the card here.

Goodbye, postcard. Fly home quickly.

Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

Mmm! Yummy!

Peppa loves pizza. Everybody loves pizza.

Did you like that, Teddy?

Yes, it was delicious.

Magnifical, Uncle Goat. There will always be a special place for your pizza in my tummy.

Thank you.

Ciao!

Goodbye.

Oh dear. Peppa has left Teddy behind at the cafe.

What a lovely relaxing holiday we are having.

Oh dear! It's the police.

Leave the talking to me.

Hello, officer. I don't know what I did, but I won't do it again.

Mr Pig, your teddy.

Teddy!

Thank you.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The End of the Holiday



Just doing my job, signora.

Peppa and her family have arrived back at their holiday house.

Time for bed.

Can we ring Goldie the fish, Mummy?

OK.

Granny and Grandpa Pig are looking after Goldie the fish while Peppa is on holiday.

I do hope we are feeding Goldie enough.

Hello?

Hello, Grandpa. Is Goldie all right?

Goldie is fine.

I sent her a postcard today. Has it arrived?

Ho! Ho! Not yet! But I'm sure it will get here soon.

Ah. Night night, Grandpa.

Night night, Peppa.

Ah.

Peppa and George are fast asleep in their holiday house.



It is the last morning of Peppa's holiday in Italy.

I'm just going for one last walk. Whoa!

Going for one last swim, Mr Pig?

Uh, yes, one last swim before I go home.

I want to stay on holiday forever.

Holidays are nice, but they don't last forever, Peppa.

Think of all your friends waiting for you back home.

Yes, I miss my friends. And I miss Goldie the fish. Can I telephone Goldie?


OK, Peppa.

Granny and Grandpa Pig are looking after Goldie the fish while Peppa is on holiday.

Hello?

Hello, Granny. How's Goldie?

Um, she's eating well.

I sent Goldie a postcard. Does she like it?

The postcard hasn't arrived yet, Peppa. But I'm sure it will be here soon.

Oh! We are coming home today. See you later.

See you later.

Suzy Sheep has come to play with Peppa.

Hello, Suzy.

Hello, Granny Pig. Is Peppa back from holiday?

Not yet, Suzy. But she's coming back today.

Oh! Suzy is missing Peppa.

This suitcase's heavy. Are you sure we need all this stuff, Mummy Pig?

These are import souvenirs from our holiday.

OK! Is everybody ready?

Yes, Daddy Pig.

Then let's go home.

Bye-bye.

Ciao!

Oh, look!

Oh dear! Peppa has forgotten Teddy.

What a lovely holiday!

Yes, I have never felt so relaxed.

Ah, hello officer. Whatever I was doing, I won't do it again.

Mr Pig, here is your Teddy. Please take a better care of him.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mirrors



Teddy, we are going home today.

Suzy Sheep cannot wait for Peppa to get back home.

Hello, Suzy.

Is Peppa home yet?

No, Suzy. But she's flying home now.

Flying high, in the sky. Flying high and high and high.

I hope it's sunny when we get home.

Peppa's family have arrived home.

Granny Pig! Grandpa Pig! Goldie! What has Grandpa done to you?

Um... she has filled out a bit, hasn't she?

Naughty Grandpa! You've fed her too much!

She was always hungry.

We've brought you some presents from Italy.

Look, Grandpa. A beautiful garden gnome!

Oh! You really shouldn't have!

Granny, has my postcard arrived?

No, Peppa. Not yet!

Oh!

That's my postcard.

Hello.

Oh, it's only Suzy!

I've really missed you, Peppa.

I've missed you too, Suzy.

Peppa and Suzy are best friends.

Here is Mr Zebra, the postman.

A postcard, all the way from Italy.

Ho! Ho! We got here quicker than the postcard.

Look, Goldie. I sent you this postcard from our holiday.


Did you have a nice time on holiday, Peppa?

Yes! Did you have a nice time?

It rained every day.

Oh, goody. That means there'll be muddy puddles.

Peppa and Suzy love jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Holidays are nice. But coming home to muddy puddles is even better.



Mummy Pig is fixing a big mirror onto the bathroom wall.

Lovely!

George thinks there is another little piggy in the bathroom.

It's a mirror, George. Mirrors are shiny. That's why you can see yourself.

George, what are you doing?

George is looking at himself in the big shiny mirror.

It is very shiny. Come on, George, let's find some more shiny things.

Daddy, we are looking for shiny things to see ourselves in.

Have a look in a spoon.

Ooh!

Peppa and George can see their faces in the shiny spoons.

Our faces look funny!

Now, turn the spoons around.

I'm upside down.

And turn it around again.

Now I'm the right way up. How does that work, Daddy?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mirrors



It's simple, Peppa. Concave surfaces reflect the light waves inversely to their origin and...

Is it magic?

Uh, yes, it's magic.

Suzy Sheep has come to play with Peppa.

Hello, Peppa and George!

Hello, Suzy! Look at that!

It's a spoon.

It's a shiny spoon. Look, I can make you go upside down.

Ooh! How does that work?

It's magic! My daddy said so!

Ah, let's find some more magic shiny things in the garden!

George has found a muddy puddle.

It is shiny enough to see our faces!

I can see the sky! There's a cloud!

Here are Pedro Pony and Danny Dog.

Hello, everyone!

Did you drop something in that puddle?

No, we're looking at the sky.

But the sky is in the sky!

Look at this spoon!

That is my face. It looks funny. Wow, now I'm upside down. How does that work?

It's a funny magic mirror spoon.

I know where there are some big funny mirrors.

Really?

Wobbly mirrors in a tent.

Where are these wobbly mirrors?

At the fair.

The parents has brought the children to the fair.


Roll up! Roll up! See my amazing wobbly mirrors!

The tent is full of big wobbly mirrors.

Ooh! What's happened to my body?

You're a wobbly jelly!

Wobble, wobble, wobble!

How does it do that, Daddy?

It is very simple. Illusions of optical differentials by convex and concave surfaces generate patterns...

So it's magic!

Uh, yes, it's magic.

Look at me. I've gone all squishy!

Grrr!

I've got a long neck, like a giraffe.

This mirror looks normal to me.

Daddy, where's your big tummy gone?

What tummy?

It is Mummy Rabbit with her baby twins, Rosie and Robbie.

Hello, sister. How are you today?

Very good, sister. Mustn't chat for long, though. I got customers inside the tent.

Are the mirror amazing, Daddy Pig?

Wow, I can see two of you!

What do you mean?

I can see you in the mirror, but there is no mirror. Is it magic?

Silly Daddy! It is Miss Rabbit and Mummy Rabbit!

Oh!

I suppose we do look a bit the same.

Well, we are sisters!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pedro Is Late




Peppa's playground are going on the trip to the museum.

Oh dear, Pedro Pony is not here.

I bet he is still in his pajamas.

Pedro is asleep in his little bed. Pedro likes sleeping.

Pedro, wake up. You will be late for the school trip.

OK, Mummy.

Come on, Pedro. We don't want to miss the bus.

The bus is still wait for Pedro Pony.

We can't wait any longer, the museum will be closed.

OK, let's go.

Oh, there's no one here!

Maybe we're early.

No Pedro, we're missed the bus.

Oh.

Come on, let's catch them up.

Pedro is always late.

Look, there is a car chasing us.

Oh, hello Mrs Pony.

Stop the bus, Pedro is here.

Sorry Madam Gazelle, I overslept.

Oh, Pedro, you do likes sleeping.

Yes, Madam Gazelle.

To the museum, nothing can stop us now.

Uh, Madam Gazelle, I need the toilet.

And me.


And me.

Me, too.

This is Granddad Dog's garage.

What will it be? Petrol or diesel?

Toilet please.

Are you sure you wouldn't like any petrol?

No, we haven't gone anywhere yet.

Right, next stop, the museum.

Oh, where is Pedro?

Petrol pumps. Interesting.

Oh! Come along, Pedro.

Bye.

I hope we get the museum before it closes.

Here is the museum. Mr Rabbit is locking up for the day.

Hello, Mr Rabbit. We would like to see the museum, please!

Mmm. We were just closing. But I can give you a quick tour.

This is the king and queen's room full of old stuff.

Ooh!

Mmm. Interesting!

Here are the giant dinosaurs. All very nice.

Ah!

Amazing!

Space rockets and all that.

Wow!

And through this door is the most amazing place of all.

It's the fantastic world you live in.

Oh.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Garden Games



Thank you, Mr Rabbit.

My pleasure, goodbye.

Right, time to go, children.

Where is Pedro?

Oh, Pedro!

A mollusca. Very interesting.

Come on, Pedro, or you'll miss the bus.

Where is everybody?

The bus has gone.

Uh. Don't worry. Miss Rabbit will realize she's left us behind.

Bong bing boo. Bing bong bing. Bing bong bingly bongly boo!

All together now!

Nobody has noticed Madam Gazelle and Pedro are missing.

Oh, have you missed the bus?

Mr Rabbit, I am a teacher. I need your car.

Come on, Pedro. We will take a shortcut.

Hello, ducks.

Madam Gazelle and Pedro have arrived back at the playgroup.

Where is the bus?

Maybe we are early.

Yes, Pedro. For once you are early.

Wow, Pedro is early!

Yes, and you are late. You're slow coaches.

Pedro likes being early. Everybody likes being early.



It's a lovely sunny day. Peppa and George are in the garden.

Daddy, we're a bit bored.

But there are lots to do in the garden.

Like what?

Uh... sit in the garden chair, read the paper and watch the grass grow.

But those are things for a Daddy to do.

Hello.

Hello, Suzy.

What are you doing?

Nothing. We're bored.

Me too, that's why I came to your house.

I've got an idea. We've an old box of garden games somewhere.

What are garden games?

I don't know.

Here we are.

Juggling sticks. Watch me juggle. Oh!

Ho-ho! They're not for juggling, Suzy. They're skittles.

We set the skittles up here, then we have to stand over here, and try to knock the skittles over by rolling this heavy ball.

Me first. Hooray!

Peppa has knocked over two skittles.

My turn.

It's very hard, Suzy. You probably won't be able to do it.

Suzy has knocked over all of the skittles.

Hooray!




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Going Boating



Oh! Well done.

Now it's George's turn.

Because George is little, he can stand a bit closer.

Oh.

George is too little to play skittles.

George doesn't like being the littlest one.

Mmm. Let's play Bat and Ball.

Peppa can throw the ball, and George has to bat it.

But if anyone catches the ball, George is out.

OK.

Caught it.

George is out. George is a bit too little even for Bat and Ball.

You just need a bit more practice, George.

Watch me.

Wow!

Oops. I'll just get the ball back.

Hello, Mummy Pig. Uh... can we have our ball back, please?

Yes, but please play more carefully in future.

Yes, Mummy Pig. Sorry, Mummy Pig.

Here is Danny Dog.

What are you doing?

We're playing Bat and Ball.

My Daddy is very good at it.

He batted the ball all the way into the house.

Wow! Can I play the Bat and Ball too?

Uh... maybe it's time for a different garden game.

Like what?

Limbo!


What's limbo when it's at home?

I'll show you.

I know, you jump over it.

It's much too high to jump over.

Ho-ho! We go under the limbo pole. And we need music to do it.

Daddy Pig is very good at limbo.

Wow!

Ah! But now we'll put the pole a bit lower. OK. Oh!

Daddy, your tummy is too big to go under the pole.

My tummy is not too big. I just can't bend like I used to.

My turn.

And me.

And me.

Well done, everyone. Now we'll put the pole even lower.

Oooh!

Easy, Daddy. It's impossible. Nobody can go under that.

Wow! George can do it.

Hooray!

George is the best at limbo dancing because he is little.

George likes playing garden games. Everyone likes playing garden games.



Peppa and her family have come to the lake to go boating.

Boats! Boats! Get your boats here.

What sort of boats do you have, Miss Rabbit?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Going Boating



I've got canoes.

Let's have a canoe.

Mmm. You have to paddle a canoe. That's hard work.

I've got sailing boats.

It's a big tricky to sail a sailing boat.

And I've got pedalos. They look nice and relaxing.

Yes, They've got a big paddle wheel to make them go.

Let's have a pedalo.

When I ring this bell, it's time to bring the boats back.

Enjoy your boat trip.

It's not moving.

No, how do we start the engine?

You're the engine, Daddy Pig. You have to pedal.

Oh, I see. Off we go, then.

It's a bicycle on the water.

Riding in a pedalo on a sunny lake.

Daddy is the engine. I hope he doesn't break.

Here are Emily Elephant and her family.

Hello, Miss Rabbit. We'd like a canoe, please.

Certainly.

The elephant family like canoeing.

Paddles ready?

Yes, Daddy Elephant!

Then let's go.

Ahoy there, Miss Rabbit.

It is Danny Dog and his dad, Captain Dog.

We'd like a boat, please.


Certainly. I have canoes, sailing boats, or pedalos.

I didn't sail the world and make my fortune to splash around in a pedalo. We'll take the sailing boat.

Do you know how to work it?

Do I know how to work it?! I'm Captain Dog!

Ruff!

Come on, Danny. All aboard! Full sail!

Aye, aye. Captain Dad.

Hello, we're sailing.

We're canoeing.

We're pedalling.

Look, an island.

We can go there for our picnic.

Hooray.

The island is a bit small to have a picnic on.

We can have our picnic in the boats.

Who'd like a sandwich?

Me, please.

Here's some bread, Mrs Duck.

Mrs Duck loves picnics. Everyone loves picnics.

Come in, boats one, two and three! Your time is up!

One, two and three. That's us.

Let's see who can get back first. We'll have a race.

Yes!

Pedal faster, Daddy.

I'm not sure I can pedal much faster.

Oh, Daddy Pig. I'll do the pedalling.

Quicker, Mummy.

This is quite a hard work, isn't it?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Mr Bull in a China Shop



Ah ha, we'll be carried back by the wind, Danny. Oh!

What is it?

The wind has stopped.

Without any wind, the sailing boat can not go.

We'll just have to wait for the wind to pick up again.

How long would that take?

I don't know. It could be weeks.

Can't we use the engine?

No, you don't have engines on sailing boats, Danny. Oh.

The sailing boat does have an engine.

Full sail.

Emily and her family are in the lead.

Pedal faster, Mummy.

We're going to win the race.

Here come Danny and Captain Dog.

Hooray! We win!

That was exausting! Next time we'll take a sailing boat.

Yes, sailing boats have engines on them.

Daddy?

See you later, Danny. I've decided to sail around the world again.

But you said you were going to stay at home.

Oh, yes. I'm not a sailor anymore. But I do love boating on the lake.

Everyone loves boating on the lake.



Peppa and her family are going for a drive.

I love our car.


Ho-ho, and our car loves us, too. Don't you?

Stop!

It's Mr Bull and his friends.

Digger, digger.

George likes diggers.

Hello, Mr Bull. What's up?

We are digging up the roads.

Will you take long?

It will take as long as it takes.

Lads, let's smash up this old pipe.

Mr Bull is good at smashing things.

Wow!

Day break!

Oh, dear. Now we have to wait even longer.

Why don't you join us, Mummy Pig? Plenty of tea to go around.

That sounds lovely. Thank you, Mr Bull.

That's a nice teapot, Mr Bull.

Yes, Peppa. It's made of delicate china.

Mr Bull likes delicate china.

You have to be very very careful with china.

Why?

Because china can break very easily.

That's why I always...

Oh!

Oh, dear, Mr Bull has smashed the teapot to pieces.

Oh, no!

I put it down too hard. I don't I know my own strength?

Maybe we can fix it, boss. I've got cement.

I've got a rivet gun.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Fruit



It is not gonna work, lads.

I know! Miss Rabit has a china shop. She could mend it.

Good idea. Mummy Pig. We'll go right now.

Can I come too?

We'll all go!

Mr Bull is going to the china shop. This is Miss Rabit's china shop.

There we are.

Hello, can I help you?

Moo!

Ah! A bull in a china shop.

Hello, Miss Rabbit. I have broken my china teapot.

Oh, dear.

Can you fix it?

Let's have a look. Mmm. That's very broken.

I smashed it to bits.

Yes. But I think I can fix it.

Oh, goodie. Can we help?

Of course, Peppa.

Oh. These two pieces fit together.

Fixing the teapot is a bit like doing a jigsaw puzzle.

Well done, Peppa. I'll glue those bits together.

George has also found two pieces that fit.

Well done, George.

Nearly finished. That's the lid.

There's just this funny-shaped bit left. Where just that go?

That's the teapot's handle, Miss Rabbit.

Oh, so it is. I don't know much about china teapots.


It's as good as new.

Be careful not to smash it again.

Ho-ho! I'm very good at smashing things.

Oh! Whew!

Well done, Peppa.

Thank you for mending my teapot, Miss Rabbit.

No trouble, Mr Bull. Whew!

Look, boss, a pothole.

There is a small hole in the road.

And it's right outside Miss Rabbit's shop.

What do you think, lads? Can we have a hole outside Miss Rabbit's shop?

No.

You fixed my teapot. I'll fix your road.

Uh, it's not my road.

Mr Bull, how are you going to mend the hole?

We'll dig up the road.

Mr Bull is digging up the road. Mr Bull likes digging up the road. Everybody likes digging up the road.



It is fruit day at the supermarket.

Look! It's Mr Potato.

Mrs Carrot.

Sweet Cranberry and Little Sprout.

Apple and banana. Pear and pineapple too. Eat five pieces of fruit a day because they're good for you.

Welcome to Fruit Day where the magic of fruit never ends.

Wow! So much fruit.

Hello, Peppa.

Hello.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Fruit



We are choosing our favorite fruit. What's your favorite?

Um... I like apples.

I like oranges.

I like bananas.

I like carrots.

Carrots are not a fruit.

Oh.

Carrots are a vegetable.

Edmond is a bit of a clever-clogs.

What's your favorite fruit, George? Is it bananas? Or oranges?

George likes strawberries the best.

Strawberry.

George loves strawberries.

Smoothies! Get your fruit smoothies here.

Hello, Miss Rabbit. What's a fruit smoothie?

It's a drink made from fruit. Would you like one?

Yes, please. Can I have a smoothie with apples?

Okay, but smoothies can have lots of different fruit in them.

Okay. Apples, raspberries, bananas and more apples.

An apple-raspberry-banana-and-more-apples smoothie.

Mmm! Delicious!

Can I have a smoothie, please?

Me too.

And me!

And me!

Of course. What fruit would you like in your smoothies?


Uh, I don't know.

It can be anything, Pedro.

OK. Cheese, please.

Pedro, cheeses isn't a fruit.

It has to be fruit or vegetables.

OK. Raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries and gooseberries.

That's more like it.



Raspberry-and-blueberry-and-blackberry-and-gooseberry smoothies for everyone.

Mmm! Lovely!

What do you want in your smoothie, George?

Strawberry.

George! A smoothie must have lots of fruit in it.

How about strawberries and pineapple, George?

No.

Maybe George would like some dinosaur juice.

Dinosaur juice?

Oh, yes. All dinosaurs like dinosaur juice.

Dinosaur.

Let's see. A bit of this, one of those, a few of these, some of that. One dinosaur juice, just for dinosaurs and their little friends.

Dinosaur.

Can I have some dinosuar juice, please, Miss Rabbit?

Me too.

And me.

And me.

OK, dinosaur juice for everyone. Oh, bother.

What's wrong, Miss Rabbit?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. George's Balloon



I've forgotten what I put in the dinosaur juice.

I can tell you what was in it?

Really? How?

By smelling it.

Freddy Fox has a very good sense of smell.

There is one banana...

One banana.

Three, no, four strawberries. Five cherries.

Strawberries, cherries...

One peach, half a pineapple, a slice of melon and something else.

What is it?

A carrot.

Yes, a carrot.

Hooray!

Dinosaur juice for everyone.

Mmm! Grrr!

Are you all enjoying Fruit Day?

Yes. We love fruit.

And carrots.

Everyone loves fruit and carrots.



Peppa and George have had a day out with Granny and Grandpa Pig.

Ice cream.

It is Miss Rabbit's ice cream store.

Let's stop for ice cream.

Why not? I think we deserve it.

Hello there!

Hello Miss Rabbit. Four ice creams, please.


Coming right up. What flavours would you like?

Strawberry for me, please.

Chocolate for me, please.

Banana for me, please.

Dinosaur, Rrrr!

Ho ho! I don't think they have dinosaur ice cream.

I think George wants a dinosaur balloon.

Do you not want an ice cream, George?

No. Dinosaur.

Ho ho. How much is the little balloon?

Ten pounds.

Ten pounds?

It's all for a good cause.

There you go, George. Hold it tight. Don't let go.

George has let go of the balloon.

Ah! Maybe I'll hold this very valuble balloon for the journey home.

George loves his dinosaur balloon.

Rrrr!

Peppa and George have arrived back at Granny and Grandpa Pigs' house.

Hold it tight this time, George. Don't let go.

Why?

Oh, George! In the world, there are two sorts of balloons.

The up balloon and the down balloon. That is an up balloon.

If you let it go, it will go up and up and up all the way to the moon.

Moon.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Peppa's Circus



Grandpa.

Oh! Ah, got you.

Perhaps we should go indoors before we lose your balloon, George.

Your balloon will be safe in here.

Hello, Polly, George has got a new balloon.

Balloon.

Don't you pop it, Polly. George loves his balloon.

Oh.

George has let go of his balloon again.

Don't worry, George. It won't fly away because the roof is in the way.

Oh, it's gone through the door.

It's going up the stairs. It's going into the attic.

Don't worry. There's only one way out of the attic.

And that is through the roof window which is always kept closed.

Oh, dear.

The roof window is not closed.

Catch it, Grandpa.

I can't, Peppa. It's in the sky.

George, your balloon is going to the moon. You'll never see it again.

Daddy Pig has come to take Peppa and George home.

Hello, have you had a lovely time?

Um, we bought George a dinosaur balloon...

But George let it go. And it's flying to the moon.

There must be some way we can get it back.

Balloon.

Look! Polly Parrot is flying after the balloon.


Polly Parrot to the rescue!

Go, Polly, go.

Polly Parrot has rescued George's balloon.

Hooray!

Who's a clever Polly?

Who's a clever Polly?

George, don't let go of your balloon again.

I know. We'll tie the string to your wrist, George.

What a good idea.

George loves his dinosaur balloon.

Everyone loves George's dinasaur balloon.



It's a lovely sunny day.

Peppa and her friends are visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig.

What's that?

Grandpa Pig is putting up a big, stripey tent in the garden.

It's the circus.

Hooray!

Grandpa, can we see the circus?

Circus, Peppa? There's no circus here.

Why have you got a big stripey tent, then?

This is for Granny Pig's garden party.

Oh. What's a garden party?

It's where grown-ups stand around, talking.

What a waste of a good tent.

A circus would be more exciting.

Why don't you make your own circus?

Yes, we can call it Peppa's Circus.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Fish Pond



Have you finished putting up the tent, Grandpa?

The guests will be here soon.

Granny, we're doing a circus for your garden party.

What a splendid idea!

Can we dress up?

Of course, I'll get the dressing up box.

We can be clowns.

And strongmen.

And jugglers.

My daddy was in the circus.

Wow, what did he do?

He sold tickets.

Here, you can all find something to wear in the dressing-up box.

Peppa has found a top hat.

Danny Dog has found some spotty trunks and a stick-on mustache.

Pedro has found a clown outfit.

Who wants makeup?

Me, please.

What does everyone want to be? I want to be the clown.

But Peppa, where is your clown costume?

OK, you be the clown.

I want to be the strongman.

OK, Danny, you be the strongman.

I want to be the juggler.

But I wanted to do that.

Wow!

OK, you be the juggler.

Grandpa, I don't have a job to do.


You can be the ringmaster, Peppa. You've got the hat for it.

What's a ringmaster?

The ringmaster is the boss.

Yes, I'll be the ringmaster. What do I do?

You say, welcome to my circus!

See the impossible, the amazing, the incredible feats of derring-do!

Ooh!

Uh... welcome to my circus! It's got amazing feat.

Granny Pig's garden party guests are here.

Hello, everyone. You're in for a treat. The circus has come to town.

Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to my circus!

Now, please be very scared of the amazing Candy Cat.

Look at George, Richard and Edmond on tricycles.

Don't stop clapping. It's the strong Danny Dog.

I was a strong man once. I used to lift tractors.

See Emily Elephant juggle potatoes and an egg.

Now laugh a lot at Pedro Pony. He's a clown.

Stop laughing, I haven't done the funny bit yet.

Ah!

That was the funny bit.

That's what I call funny.

Thank you. That's the end of my amazingly impossible circus.

Hooray!

That is the best circus I have ever seen.



Peppa and her family are having a day out.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Fish Pond



We are going to see a pond that has little fish swimming in it.

Ooh!

I used to go there when I was a boy. We are here.

Where is the fish pond?

It's in the middle of the woods. We have to walk to it.

Will we get lost like we always do?

Ho-ho! No. Remember, I came here when I was a little piggy.

But that's a long time ago, Daddy Pig.

In the olden days.

Thank you, Peppa.

Well, in the olden days, we started the walk by going along a path.

Ah! This is the one.

How do you know?

There are little flowers going here, just like I remember.

Things might have changed, Daddy Pig.

Nothing changes that much.

Now, we walk past through little trees until we come to a big tree.

I think the little trees have grown.

Oh, yes, they do all seem big, don't they?

How are we going to find the right big tree? Oof!

It's usually me that walks into trees.

Mummy Pig has found the big tree.

Clever Mummy.

Ha-ha! I knew it would still be here. This way, everybody.

Are we nearly at the fish pond yet?


Almost there.

But I'm getting a bit hungry.

Don't worry, there's a cafe on the way.

Oh, lovely. I can do with a nice cup of coffee.

Can George and I have ice creams, please?

Of course. Ice creams for everyone.

The cafe should be just about here. Oh.

Where's the cafe? Is it behind that rotten pile of wood?

I think that rotten pile of woods is the cafe.

Oh!

There is not going to be any ice creams coming out of that today.

Hello! What can I get you?

Oh!

A cup of coffee and three ice creams, please.

Of course.

Thank you.

Mmm, delicious!

Next stop, the fish pond. This way.

Oh, you don't want to go that way.

That goes straight into a blackberry bush.

Ah ha, it's the shortcut. It's the way I went when I was a boy.

No, if you want to go to the fish pond, you need to go up that path.

Well, I'm taking the shortcut.

All right, who wants to go through a blackberry bush?

Me.

And who wants to go on the path?

Me!



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Snowy Mountain



Race you, Daddy.

Ho-ho! I'll get there first.

Bye.

I hope the fish pond is still here.

Yes, everything seems a bit different to what Daddy Pig remembers.

What's that?

It's the fish pond.

George, let's see the little fish.

Oh. Daddy said that the fish were tiny, but they're ginormous!

It's been a long time since Daddy was here.

The fish have got a lot bigger.

Like Daddy's tummy.

Oh, where is Daddy?

Oh, he might be lost. I better ring him.

There's a phone ringing in that bush.

Hello, Mr Pig speaking.

It's Daddy.

Oh! Hello, I'm stuck.

Hello, Daddy.

Hang on. We'll pull you out.

One, two, three, pull.

Daddy is a blackberry bush.

Ah, the fish pond. Let's see the little fish.

Whoa! That's a big fish.

Oh, look! There's something glittering.

They're coins.

When I was little, we used to throw a coin in the pond and make a wish.

Can we throw coins in?

Of course.


I wish the fish pond stays here forever.

Ho-ho! That's what I wished for when I was a little piggy.

And your wish came true, Daddy.



It is a lovely snowy day.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Peppa.

Peppa and her friends have come to the mountains to go skiing.

See you all at the top.

Come on, car. You can make it! Oh!

The car can not drive up the mountain. The snow is too slippery.

You have to take the ski-lift.

The ski-lift is carrying everyone to the top of Snowy Mountain.

Uh... it looks a bit high. Whoa!

Daddy pig does not like heights.

This is really fun.

Oh, yes, really fun.

In the air, in the chair, snow is falling everywhere.

Flying high, in the chair. Flying high and high and high.

The ski-lift has reached the top of Snowy Mountain.

Whoa. Ooh.

Daddy is a walking talking snowman.

Brrrrr! Ho-ho.

Skis, skis! Get your skis here.

Hello, Miss Rabbit. Skis for two grownups and two children, please.



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grampy Rabbit in Space



There you go.

Madame Gazelle is the ski teacher.

Madame Gazelle, will we ski all the way down the mountain?

Ho-ho, not today, Danny.

I think for now we will stick to the baby slope.

The children are learning to ski on a little slope.

To start, push off slowly with your sticks.

Whee!

To stop, point your skis together.

Skiing is fun.

Let's go back up and do it again now.

Whoa!

Walking up slopes on skis is not easy.

Ah-ho! To go up the slope, you have to walk sideways like a crab.

Everyone is walking sideways like a crab.

Madame Gazelle, can we see you ski now?

Oh, I don't know.

Please.

Very well. Hoop-la!

That was amazing!

Yes, I was the world champion at skiing and won this cup.

Oooh!

Now, which mummy or daddy would like a go?

Why not?

Are you sure, Mummy Pig? You haven't skied for years.

It's just like riding a bike, Daddy Pig. You never forget.


Here is the baby slope, Mummy Pig.

I think I'm a bit grown up for the baby slope. Which way does this go?

On the way down the mountain.

My mummy is skiing down the mountain.

Ah! Where are the brakes?

Oh, she can't stop. We have to catch up with her.

Stand back!

Mummy Pig is skiing along the road.

Everyone is in the coach, chasing after Mummy Pig.

Wow! My mummy is skiing super fast.

Whoa... Whoa! Ooh!

Mummy did a loop-the-loop.

That was fantanstic skiing!

Mummy pig is skiing past the shops.

How am I going to stop? Oof!

My goodness. A walking, talking snowman.

No, it's just my mummy.

Brrrr!

I have never seen such amazing skiing.

This cup belongs to you.

Thank you.

My mummy is the best at skiing down the mountain.



Peppa and her friends are at playgroup.

Children, today, we have a special treat.

Grampy Rabbit is here to talk about space rockets.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Grampy Rabbit in Space



Rocket! Brrr!

George loves space rockets.

Hello, everybody!

Grampy Rabbit has a very loud voice.

What have I got here?

A rock.

Yes, but not any old rock. I found it on the moon.

Oooh!

My dad sells rocks in packs of five.

Yes, thank you. Freddy.

You don't need to go to the moon to get them.

You do if you want moon rock.

Grampy Rabbit, how did you go to the moon?

I flew in a rocket.

It's a bit small.

This is just a model. The rocket I went in was GINORMOUS!

Do you all know how to count to five?

Yes! One, two, three, four, five!

Excellent! But when you go into space, you count backwards.

Five, four, three, two, one!

And then you have to shout blastoff as loudly as possible!

Blastoff!

I can't hear anything.

Blastoff!

Vroom!

There I was flying through space!

Oooh!

And then I landed on the moon.


It was so beautiful up there. I was lost for words.

That sounds nice.

Did you know you can jump really high on the moon?

Oh!

How high?

As high as a house.

Why can you jump so high on the moon?

Um...

The gravitational pull is smaller on the moon.

Oh, yes, that's it.

You're quite a clever clogs, aren't you?

Edmond Elephant is a clever-clogs.

I was a little bit lonely up there with just the moon and the stars.

And the most exciting bit was...

What's the most exciting bit, Grampy Rabbit?

I can't hear you.

Why has he stopped talking?

Oh dear, Grampy Rabbit has lost his voice.

I had better ring Doctor Brown Bear.

Dr Brown Bear speaking.

Hello, Dr Brown Bear. Gramp Rabbit has lost his voice.

Is that such a bad thing?

Yes, he's giving an important talk about space rockets to the children.

Oh, in that case, I'll be straight there.

Hello, Grampy Rabbit. I hear you've lost your voice.

Say "ah", please.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. The Olden Days



I see. Yes, a very serious case of losing a voice.

Too much shouting, I imagine.

Let's see if a little bit of medicine helps.

Open wide.

Try saying "ah" now. Louder.

That's better.

Not back to normal! But getting there!

Hooray!

Now where was I?

You were just about to tell us the most exciting bit.

Oh yes! The most exciting bit was, I wrote a song.

Would you like to hear it?

No, thank you.

Yes, please.

I got up this morning.

And all I could see, was the moon and the stars.

The moon, the stars. The moon, the stars.

The moon, the stars. The moon, the stars.



Suzy Sheep has come to play at Peppa's house.

Hello, Suzy!

Hello, Peppa! I've got something to show you. Look!

What is it?

It's a photograph. Who do you think it is?

Ah! It's a baby sheep!

It's me.

You are not a baby.


It's an old photo, when I was a baby.

Don't be silly, Suzy.

In the olden days, you were a baby too, Peppa.

No, I wasn't!

Yes, you were. Ask your mummy.

Mummy Pig is working on the computer.

Mummy!

Hello, Peppa!

Suzy is talking nonsense.

No, I am not.

She said, in the olden days, I was a baby.

Well, you were. Peppa.

Look! Here are some photos on the computer. Who do you think that is?

It's baby Alexander!

Baby Alexander is Peppa's cousin.

No, that's you as a baby, Peppa.

Baby Peppa. Ha ha ha.

Somebody sounds like they're having fun.

Look, Daddy, that's a picture of me as a baby.

I remember it well. It was taken on our first day in this house.

What do you mean?

When you were little, we moved into this house.

We brought all our things on top of our car.

Mummy Pig put some pictures up.

Daddy Pig put up a shelf.

And Grandpa Pig made us a lovely flower garden.

Where's Grandpa's lovely flower garden now?

Daddy Pig looked after it.




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pirate Treasure



Uh... We have the wrong kind of soil for flowers.

Oh!

And anyway, you need somewhere to play.

You and Suzy love to play in the garden.

Was Suzy my friend in the olden days?

Yes, you and Suzy have always been best friends.

In the olden days, did Suzy and me jump up and down in muddy puddles?

No, Peppa. You were babies. You could't even walk.

Oh.

What did we do?

You cried. You burped. And you laughed.

We were babies.

Baby Suzy.

Baby Peppa.

Goo-goo gaga, goo-goo gaga.

Soon after that, you were toddles.

And where was George?

He was a baby in my tummy.

Yes, you were in my tummy, George.

You've got a big tummy, Daddy. Is there a baby in there?

No. Peppa. This tummy is pure muscle.

And soon George was born.

And Granny and Grandpa gave George a very special present.

Can you guess what it was?

Mr Dinosaur!

That's right!

Grrr!


And you and Suzy were running and jumping around.

Then one day, you saw something amazing.

Muddy puddle.

Peppa, if you jump in muddy puddles, you must wear your boots.

You love jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

I still do.

Let's take a photo now!

Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Peppa has always loved jumping up and down in muddy puddles.



Danny Dog is playing in his pirate den.

Arrr!

Here are Peppa and her friends.

Hello, Danny.

Hello, everyone. Do you want to play pirates?

Yes.

Get dressed up, then.

Danny Dog has a dressing-up box full of pirate clothes.

Aha!

Aha, me hearties!

I've got a treasure chest.

Oooh!

It's a biscuit tin.

It's a treasure chest.

But it's still got biscuits in.

Uh... who wants a biscuit?



	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pirate Treasure



Me, me, me!

Now it's a treasure chest.

Let's find some treasure to put in it.

Hurrah!

Someone has to stay here to guard the pirate ship.

Me! I will guard it.

If you see someone coming, shout: "Stop! Who goes there?"

Stop! Uh... who goes there?

OK. Let's go find some treasure.

Danny Dog likes being a pirate.

Everyone likes being a pirate.

Hurrah.

Oh jolly pirates we, that sail the deep blue sea, to find a golden treasure, for sails are high yippee.

Danny has found a pinecone.

Treasure!

Peppa has found a shell.

Treasure!

Suzy has found an old bit of rope.

Treasure!

Freddy has found a pebble.

Treasure!

I'll just have a little sleep.

Pedro always takes his glasses off before he sleeps.

Let's creep up on Pedro.

Yes.

Danny, Peppa, Suzy and Freddy are creeping up on Pedro.

Boo!

Oh!


Arrr!

You were asleep.

Uh, yes. Sorry.

You're lucky we're friendly pirates.

We've got treasure.

That's nice.

Let's put it in the treasure chest.

Now we can bury it.

Yes.

And I'll stay here and guard the pirate ship.

OK, Pirate Pedro, but don't fall asleep this time.

I won't.

Hurrah!

The pirates are off to bury the treasure chest.

Over a hill, round the little bush.

Let's bury it here.

How will we know where we've buried it?

Let's make a treasure map. Over the hill, round the little bush. And "X" marks the spot.

X marks the spot.

Pedro has fallen asleep again.

Arrr!

I'm awake, I'm awake.

Pedro, don't you wear glasses?

Uh...

Hello.

Mummy Pony has come to collect Pedro.

Who goes there?

I'm your mummy, Pedro.

Pedro cannot see very well without his glasses.

Where are your glasses?




	 

Peppa Pig Season 	. Pirate Treasure


Um, I don't know, mummy.

When did you last have them?

When we put the treasure into the treasure chest.

What treasure chest?

The one we buried in the garden.

Pedro's glasses are buried in the garden.

Oh, dear. How are we going to find them

now?

We've got a treasure map.

Mummy Pony is using Peppa's map to find the

buried treasure.

Over the hill, round the little bush, and X marks the

spot.

They have found the treasure.

My glasses.

Hurrah!

Thank you.

Treasure maps are very useful, especially for

finding your glasses if you accidentally bury them.
